other I do enjoy this coffee shop, though admittedly it has largely subscribed to bohemian bloodletting since emerging from the former Willo House. They still present photographs, paintings, sculptures and more throughout the cafe, most, if not all, for sale. The clientele has changed, as has the interior. Regardless, it's still a nice place for coffee. For those who haven't been, it's set in an old house on the southeast corner of 3rd Avenue and McDowell. Personally, one of my favorite activities is to start here for coffee and take a walking tour in the area. It's one of the few neighborhoods in Phoenix with historic homes from the 1920s, which seem to be untouched by the authoritarian overlords of homeowner's associations so popular in suburbs. I could be wrong, as I don't live in the area. But, to stay on topic, the menu is a bit pricey but Hob Nob's has retained the Willo House's cozy, neighborly feel, though yes, over a few short years it transitioned from hippie to yuppie.
other I love German food, and as far as the food went at Bavarian Point, they had some good eats. The *only* reason I'm giving the restaurant two stars instead of one is the food. Their rindsroulade was very good, and the red cabbage and spaetzle were excellent. But the quality of the food was undercut by the poor service. It was bad enough that I wouldn't return, and certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. As others have noted, there was no-one to greet or seat us -- not even a sign saying "seat yourself". Our waitress took a LONG time to make it to our table to take our drink orders, and when she did, she was complaining about something and looked put-out in general. When my wife ordered a beer, the waitress told her that it would be more expensive because it wasn't available on tap. Now, that could be useful information, but the manner in which she told my wife was defiant rather than helpful. Believe me, we gave her no reason to be so sour --  it was clear that this particular waitress was clearly unhappy -- whether with her job or life, it's hard to say. It's too bad, really, because the food *was* good. But why would anyone want to eat at a restaurant whose workers are either nowhere to be found, or miserable? Not me.
other I got on the internet and looked at the menu and called in the order. I informed Brother's that I had a $3 coupon also and would pick up the perpperoni pizza and sampler and they said it would be 20 minutes.  At the register I was charged $12.9other for the $8.9other sampler.  I told the cashier that the internet menu had it listed for $8.95.  She just smiled and said "Oh, we get that a lot but we don't have a menu."  I said, "but it's on the internet with your address/web page"  and she said, "yeh, I know we get that a lot but here's our menu"  and she handed me their copy-machine menu which did not even have the sampler listed.  I politely told her that they should take the menu off the internet if it's not right.  The sampler was other pieces each of wings, mushrooms, cheese sticks, zuchinni.  The sampler was just like frozen generic small pieces "out-of-the-freezer-bag" deep fried.   I live near and our family had hoped to make this our weekly outing for pizza; however, I'll go elsewhere for better food and prices.  I also don't like false advertising.  A customer's frustration should be a business owner's learning opportunity to make their business better.  They can learn a lot from their customers.
other Another fox restaurant concept-- healthy and simple. I liked going here, the service was great but the portions were kinda small and most of the patrons were really ugly. I did have something pretty amazing there-- a marscapone creamed corn-- it was awesome!
3 Worth the trip but be willing to deal with some craziness. There was a mob waiting outside before the doors even opened.other pair of dressy sandalsother pairs of ankle bootsother pair of pumpsother dresses3 pairs of name brand nylons=$215So I got a deal. Was is the best deal ever? Probably not, but it was definitely worth the trip. Pros: Unlike other thrift/bargain stores everything is stored by size and type of item. Cons: The psycho shopper club that meets 30 mins prior to store opening!
other This place is so good. I love the big sandwhiches and the soups are so delicious. The only complaint I have is that I went twice and I unfortunately got hair and a fingernail clipping in my soup in two different times I went.
other 4.other stars!I've eaten at Liberty Market a few times already, but this morning marked my first breakfast- and what a fantastic meal it was!- of pancakes (3 in a stack; $6.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg#Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg w/ added topping of "market-made granola" ($1), a side of Grilled Flattened Meatballs ($3.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw#MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw, and a double-shot of espresso ($2) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg#M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg.  Service was in fine form-- I couldn't have the market-made maple syrup blend, nor any of the house-whipped cream, blueberry compote, raspberry and apricot jams, or any of the flavored syrups used at the coffee counter (my server patiently checked for those items we were unsure about), and when I asked for chocolate chips, I was, instead, offered a chocolate syrup made from scratch composed of chocolate, sugar, and coco oil... good stuff!  This syrup would be excellent on ice cream sundaes, too.  (FYI, I didn't really need anything extra to add to the pancakes and meatballs... the two paired well!)I've mentioned this once before, but I think it's such a great thing to yelp about again-- buy an espresso (or any of their specialty coffees), and you can have unlimited cups of regular coffee during your meal!  Not like I needed more caffeine after the double-shot, but I did have some of the house-blend coffee.  After 1.other pancakes, the meatballs (watch out, they're very greasy!), and caffeine, I'll be good to go for a few hours, despite only having four hours of sleep!  (I'm hoping, anyway!)p.s.  Despite tipping more than 20% at the cashier upon ordering, I thought Bruce, the server who took care of me at my table, deserved a couple more bananas for not displaying annoyance at my staying here so long.  One more reason why I love Liberty Market so much!  Addendum:  After getting directions from Bruce as to the quickest way to 10other N, he asked me if I wanted a cup of coffee to go, gratis!  Have I told you how much I love Liberty Market??Helpful hint:  Free wifi can be accessed by entering the code printed at the bottom of your receipt.
other I recall my first visit to Carolina's...The time? About other PM.As my GPS says "You have arrived at your destination," I frantically look. I see nothing that looks like a hole in the wall restaurant!Well, I review the exact address, and note that the address (120other Mohave Street) matches the "ghetto" building with all the nice cars parked afront."Well, that must be it!"I park. Then I walk up to the door. The entrance reminded me of a homeless shelter or food bank.As I entered, the restaurant was filled with people.Since then, I have repeated visits to Carolina's with a few favorites...- Chips and Salsa- Shredded Beef Taco (Crispy)- Cheese Quesadillas- Cheese EnchiladasThe food is low-priced. For example, tacos are about $other each. Burritos are about $other each.Additional Notes:- Closes relatively early in the evening.- Serves breakfast.
other Had a couple of happy hour apps here, all flavorless. Bacon wrapped scallops: bacon undercooked, scallop overcooked.  Seared Ahi Tuna:  flavorless.  Pork sliders:  Not bad, but not memorable. Service was good. Go to Tutti Santi in the same mall instead.
other I've always had a pleasant experience at Mojo in Tempe Marketplace. I have been to this location about other times and they always provide good quality and value. My favorite is the red velvet froyo.
other Good food, friendly people. We like the Gold Strike Burger -- we get it almost every time. Also try the shrimp appetizer and the bread pudding dessert. Appetizer and dessert, plus a Kiltlifter Beer or two, is sometimes all you need. The only sad thing is, because they are a bit off the beaten track, they will have to close for the summer, until November. We will miss them until then.
other I was only here for one night on 9/7, but I was very pleased with my stay.  The place is beautiful, the rooms are big, and the people at the front desk were pleasant and efficient.The only down side to my stay was that I lost water pressure in the shower Friday night.  Fortunately, it was only brief.  Other than that, I enjoyed my stay.  This will be my base of operations for my next visit.As for others' comments that there isn't anything nearby - That's what cars are for.  Last I heard you can rent them here and there.
other I was excited about the concept of a haircut and a beer.  So, when I saw an offer from Livingsocial I purchased three coupons.  Here's the trouble... I went on a Tuesday night at 6:30pm and was told they will not honor the coupon until 7pm.  However, I was told if I wanted to pay for a cut at the standard rate, they would take me ASAP.  Nobody was in the joint and they refused to take my Livingsocial coupon until after 7pm.
other I've been to Buffalo Wild Wings before, but my first visit at this location was during UFC 117.If you come here to watch fighting events like UFC I would recommend arriving other hours before the main card starts if you want a seat inside. I arrived an hour before the PPV portion of the fight started and didn't get a seat until half an hour in and it was outside. I ordered 1other regular wings and I was very underwhelmed. I felt the wings were overpriced because they are smaller than average.The main reason why I went here was that they weren't charging a cover or bill minimum for the fight. Also, the atmosphere for a UFC fight was really good compared to the other BWW I went to in Tucson.If you want a place with a good atmosphere for a sporting event, you should come to BWW. But your food expectations should be lowered a lot.
other At least one a week. Can't go wrong. My family's favorite chips & hot sauce anywhere.Wife loves the veggie burro.
other My friends kidnapped me for my birthday (yes, because they are wonderful), threw me in the back of my friend Jill's van and rushed me off (blindfolded of course) to Radio Milano.My friend Lindsay knew I had been dying to go there (I love Postino--same owner and across the street--so I just knew Radio Milano was going to be amazing).I've never met the man that owns these restaurants: La Grande Orange, Postino, Radio Milano etc (Lindsay apparently once did, lucky girl) but whoever he is, he is a business genius. The atmosphere of Radio Milano was sophisticated and classy without being uptight.  Everyone was extraordinarily nice and helpful.  True to form for this restaurateur's style, there is a large vase of (fresh every day) flowers that compliment the warm glow of the restaurant in general.Our server welcomed us with what were presented as "Italian Potato Chips" and a delicious dipping sauce.  The homemade ginger ale is so strong in taste, really good.I ordered the special for the night which was a vegetable lasagna.  It was soooooo good.  I'm glad I have such awesome friends to kidnap me and take me to great places.
3 I don't know what Bar Smith is trying to be. I feel like instead of just saying okay we are going to be a X music club on Saturday night they decided to try and appease too many people. 90s R&B and Hip hop on the first floor Techno Electronica on the roof top bar. oooooKAY.I visited the during the 4th Annual Pub crawl at 11:30 at night the place was still pretty empty. Drinks-MehCrowd-Meh, I am still trying to find the young professional males in this area.Layout- I like itBouncers-Really big and Super nice but then again I smiled a lot and didn't give them a hard time about my ID. The last other is what gives it the A-Okay and not a full out Meh. I could see throwing a party there, people love dancing outside and on rooftops. This has both and the first floor DJ was decent, all things considered. I will give this place another chance. Maybe it can redeem itself up to other stars.
other KIerland Commons is a fantastic development. Lots of great shopping, restaurants, lofts, etc.... Only problem for me is that I live in Scottsdale and frequent the Scottsdale Public Library, therefore I want my tax dollars to go into Scottsdale's coffers so I will try to do most of my shopping and dining across the street at the Scottsdale Quarter (except for Zinc Bistro - I'll keep going to Zinc regardless of what zip code it's in).
3 Restaurants that are open 2other hours play an important role for certain kinds of people - ones that work odd hours, people who like to eat at non-standard times of day, and, of course, people who are out late partying and want to put something in their stomach at 3 am. Taco Felix is a godsend for anyone who falls into one or more of the above categories. It provides decent and affordably-priced Mexican food 2other hours a day and best of all, it has a drive-through. My husband and I tried this place for the first time for lunch today. We went at a standard time of day because this place is just a few blocks from us and we wanted to see if it was decent before we tried it out one night after midnight after karaoking it up at Silver Pony (just a block or so away). We ordered 4-other different items - rolled tacos, bean tostada, carne asada taco, quesadilla supreme, and a chile relleno - and a large soda, and it only came out to $12! As a side note, the credit card receipt didn't provide a space to leave a tip, so you should bring a few bucks to thank the employee working for their efforts. The only major downside was that it took quite a while for our food to come, since the drive-through was hopping (lots of people getting menudo after a crazy Friday night, I'm assuming) and there were only other chefs and one server (who had to take and serve both drive-through and eat-in orders). However, the food was definitely decent and the portions really sizable, and we felt that it was a great value for our money. Now that we know Taco Felix serves good food for good prices, we won't hesitate to come back during one of those unusual times - to get a chorizo/egg burrito on the way to an early morning flight, to grab a mid-afternoon snack when most other places are closed, or to fill our stomachs late one night after a few drinks.
other great food... love the pad thai....awesome atmosphere...
other First, I hope La Fonda management reads these reviews and takes steps to improve their restaurant.  Second, we miss the bloody mary bar too.  Hubby & I visited LF a few weeks ago on a Saturday night for dinner. We asked the waitress a general question about a beer and she made something up that was ridiculously wrong.  Okay, she doesn't know beer.  We liked the chips & salsa, it was a good start, then I took a sip of my water.  What the?  I know what Tempe tap water tastes like, but this was weird.  The aftertaste made me cringe, I couldn't drink it, even with a slice of lemon in it, maybe it was the ice.  Hubby ordered chicken enchiladas, which he orders practically everywhere, and it was so bad he didn't finish it.  My meal was not memorable either.  I wanted to love this place, or at least like it.  We walked out of there terribly disappointed, I doubt we'll go back.
other I recently went to my first First Friday (and my first trip to downtown Phoenix). After a few hours at the Phoenix Art Museum, friends and I hopped on the light rail and tried a new restaurant. Enter The Breadfruit.Easy to find (sign on the street corner) on a charming and quiet little street sits The Breadfruit with a hostess standing out front greeting guests. You can see the very intimate seating area from the street and it was packed (a good thing for 8:30pm on a Friday night). We sat and waited outside at the cute little tables (way too hot to eat a full meal outside). We were offered menus to peruse while we waited about 10 minutes for a table.Inside, we ordered two mixed drinks (a mojito vanilla for me). They were strong and very good. The mojito was very minty and refreshing and my mojito-loving friend said he should have ordered a mojito. (Read: Get a mojito.)The Food: We split a tilapia patty (very spicy!) for an appetizer. (Patties are Jamaican empanadas.) I had the coconut curried tofu with rice and peas, ripe plantains, and veggies. This is the one of the best tofu dishes I have ever had. My only complaint is that Breadfruit needs to have more plantains per plate. They are so good!One friend had the curried chicken and dumpling with a green banana, veggies, plantains, and a side order of rice and peas. Although he didn't like the whole wheat dumpling, he loved the curry sauce and the green banana. He called the sauce "delectable." Overall, this is a great place. Small, but great. The drinks are strong, the food is great, and the serve is prompt. Our only regrets are 1) not enough plantains and 2) we should have gotten dessert.
other The scenery was amazing!! Wooooooooo!! - Well thats my biggest impression of this place. If you're looking for a great place to golf, i suggest you swing by this place. They give you other stars customer service and making sure that you're having the best time of your life.
other This place is very off-the-beaten-track, I'm sure most people overlook it....I only came across it whilst searching online for somewhere 'different' to eat...and when I came across the review on the Phoenix New Times website(http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2005-02-10/dining/sultans-of-shish/), I knew this was it...I only docked a star for the (extremely) sparse decor and atmosphere...this place could have been any other type of business with just a change of sign and omission of tables...anyway, the food was great! my fiance ordered skewers of beef and lamb(I'm not too keen on lamb, but the beef was tender and succulent...very well spiced!)...I had a cucumber salad(diced, along with onions and parsley, and soaked in vinegar-lemon juice), which enchanted me so much that I created my own version at home and make it every time I feel like doing a bit of dicing(msg me for the recipe--it's a bit death-breathy and labor-intensive but delicious!)...and, during dessert, I could see why Samarkand was voted 'Best Tea in Phoenix'...the black tea was easily the best I've ever had(besides a special brand of blue ginger tea I make a point to keep my cabinet stocked with)...it was strong and rich...absolutely incredible!definitely make it a point to search this place out--it's worth the effort!
other This review is based solely on service - not the food. I am sitting in a booth at RA as I type this - that is how upset I am with the host staff at ra. I called ahead to inform the restaurant that we would have a party of 8. When we arrived the girls at the front were so rude I almost walked out. We waited 3other min for our table and the entire time the host staff was looking my entire group up and down giving us the "stink eye". I am sorry that you are 18 years old, work for $8 and have a stick up your butt, but do not make us feel unwelcome. My girlfriend and I went to the back to use the bathroom - the host followed us back and asked us what we were doing - not to help us find the bathroom but just to be a snob. From here on out ra is ruined for me.
other What a find during my ongoing Vietnamese food trip - a Vietnamese restaurant which, unlike the others I've been to, is located in a charming converted little home rather than in a run down strip mall.  But the food is just as good or better, and with run-down-strip-mall-eatery prices. Their banh xeo (crispy rice crepes stuffed with beansprouts and shrimp) is awesome, and the generous seafood soup with white asparagus is something I'd order even on a hot day.  One of my favorite Vietnamese dishes is rice vermicelli with shrimp and pork or beef, and while their version is not as bold in flavor as Dong A's, it is definitely quite tasty. The courteous service complements the brevity of the wait between placing your order and receiving your food.
other I was excited to go to the lululemon athletica at Scottsdale Quarter because I really enjoyed shopping at the previous store that closed in Scottsdale. Well something has changed... I walked into the store and while there were more sales clerks than customers, no one said a word to me and no one asked if I needed any help. They were all too busy talking with one another. And to add insult to to injury... one clerk had to walk around me (didn't ask if I needed help) and went to play with one of the customers dogs.... I had fully intended to buy a Christmas gift there, but left because the service was so poor and I did need help with the sizing.   I went over to the Nike store and had a totally different experience, very positive.  I'll stick with Lucy and Nike where they appreciate their customers.
other Boring.  Uninspired.  Generally sauce-less, which means the meat courses are plain and dry.  The salmon tastes like styrofoam.  The filet is flavorful but they use low quality cuts.  The veggies are simply steamed.  No doubt the options are healthy, but at the sacrifice of flavor.  When I pay this much to eat out, I want to taste it and enjoy it.
3 My wife and i stayed there for our anniversary and had a great time.  little dissappointed in the cottage we stayed in.  i know the place is old but you have to update and remodel every once in awhile (century).  I want to give other stars but i also think that the price was a little steep for a summer rate.  Now, i know that i should expect to pay alot for the biltmore but i am not the ritzy type of person.  I am sure my wife would give it other stars.
3 Cliché Central. Style without substance can be summed up in their cheese plate: pineapple, melon, grapes, herbed chevre, Babybel minis (they even leave the wax on for ya) and cubes of pepper jack and colby jack served with sesame crackers.  I can't make this gold up.  They serve a lot of "martinis" as the name implies, very few of which actually contains the ingredients for a proper martini.  But then again, now that I've described the cheese plate, this should come as no surprise.  If you, dear reader, decide to open a bar, it's really quite simple.  Get everyone drunk, quickly, and hire bathroom attendants willing to squirt soap into your customers' hands.  Oh hell no, we're not in a recession.  The Ferrari up front was paid in cash, I'm quite sure.  And that woman over there? 100% real.  Ok that degraded fairly quickly.  Like my evening.  If you strip everything away and look at it for what it is, Blue Martini is stylish spot to get drunk in an attempt to forget reality.  If that's your thing, and want to feel better about your age, check it out.
other WOW!  From service to food, other stars!    Went here last night for our 10th anniversary.   They never cease to amaze us.   Husband had a Caesar salad, Rib Eye with crab legs and I had a salad with Balsamic Vinagrette,  Salmon with Asian glaze with a carrott and swiss chard medley.  Amazing!!   Perfection.  Kyle served us, we were impressed by his knowledge of the menu and attention to detail.    Everyone we came in contact with was pleasant.  If only more restaurants treated their patrons this way!  If you have their VIP card you also earn 'points' which convert into $ you can use towards a future visit.    Thanks Kyle and McCormick and Schmicks!!
other I am a huge "foodie", from a long line of "foodies". I grew up living in hotels and on room service and fine dining. This is the best, very best, breakfast restaurant EVER! I have been living in Tempe for about six years now, the first two sad sad years I did not know that this wonderful place existed...after my first visit, this is my go-to, best place to recommend, favorite breakfast place to eat at! If you go on a Sunday, it will be very very busy. Everyone is super friendly. The place is very clean. Prices are amazing! Cheaper or as cheap as the nasty breakfast places or fast food. Huge portions and great quality food. I have never had a bad experience here, and to be honest...even if I did, I wouldn't care. I feel like home here. Everything on the menu is delicious! I've tried almost everything. Here are a few of my favorites (don't forget though, I love it all) :O'Pear Grenache Omelette, Greek Fetash Omelette, English Harvest Omelette, Huevos Con Chorizo (with scrambled eggs), and the Blueberry Hill Girdle Cakes (pancakes! you can order half an order or little ones...we always get an order to share at the table). Their potatoes are delicious and crispy, the english muffins are great and their homemade jam is absolutely amazing! I have bought many jars of their jam to give as gifts! Just delicious! I wish everyone knew about this well kept secret. DON'T LISTEN TO ANY REVIEW UNDER A other STAR! This place is the best, bottom line. Try it. You will be hooked.
other Pita Jungle is a great place to get inexpensive Mediterranean food (as long as you don't mind a bit of a wait).The food usually gets served up really fast, but then your waiter leaves and -never comes back-.  I'm not ususally a stickler for outstanding wait service, but I do like to get my glass refilled and be given my check in a timely manner.Never-the-less, the food is so good it makes up for any other flaws.
other Wow! This newly opened little food shop in the Mekong Plaza is fantastic. Very authentic Hue Food. Although I'm not a Vietnamese, I have been to Hue in Vietnam and had their famous Bun Bo Hue. Must say that this store was very close to the authentic Bun Bo Hue. The pork hock and the other meat used was very tender, the noodle was perfect. The broth is lightly flavored so that you can use the Shrimp Paste for those who like it a bit more salty. The veggie was very generous.The Banh Beo was another neat Hue snack. It's a very thin rice cake snack which is steamed. You dip it in Fish Sauce. It was very nice and moist.Their menu is pretty limited as they only have about 6-7 items, but they are definitely featuring the best of hue to serve. Very impressed to see. There was a good crowd too, so lot's of people have been dying for some nice Hue food.Only thing to note is they were a bit disorganized the opening weekend as their register was not even working, and the service was a bit slow. I'm sure after a few weeks, this place will be running smoothly.
other God Bless Lifetime Fitness.First off, let me tell you how much I despise working out.  Like, at times I'd rather drink my own pee than even come within 50 feet of the stair stepper.  However, LTF (have you noticed that I like to abbreviate?  Get used to it friends...)  makes my gym experience fairly painless.  Steve W, I salute you for aknowledging the value of such a fine work-out establishment, and I actually have many of the same opinions. But because I like to hear myself talk, I'll reiterate some of my favorite points.First off, I'm absolutely not a fan of children.  Especially at a gym.  Lifetime has FREE childcare for kiddos 1other and under so us singles can flirt our way through our workout without your kids sniffling and screaming.  Kids can play and swim outside under parental supervision at the pool, complete with waterslides and some kid-specifc water fountain spray thing.  They love it.  And I do too.  WATERSLIDES?  I mean come on.  LoveitLoveit.Lifetime's members span the board, which is nice because I like the fact that I'm not the most out of shape person there.  I also like that there is nice scenery to watch and inspire me to keep my feet on that god forsaken stair stepper.  You may even see a professional athelete or TV personality on occasion.  Who doesnt love that?You never wait for a piece of equipement because there are tons of machines.  And they are not covered in meathead sweat, which is always nice.My favorite part of LTF is the group classes.  Excellent teachers, classes every day of the week, and a good variety of options.  I'd like to see more coreographed classes like Hip-Hop, but whatever, Kickboxing Jam is pretty damn close.   Locker rooms are always spotless, towel service is free, sauna and steam rooms arent full of weirdo naked people, and they have this device that dries your bathing suit in under a minute.  Ingenious!  I've been a member of a ton of Scottsdale gyms but I drive the extra 20 minutes in rush hour to go to the Tempe LTF.  Doesnt road rage burn calories anyway??  Win-win situation.
other Great beer, Good atmosphere, Non annoying music and great wait staff make this my favorite place to spend an evening.
3 the food was okay, it's a bit pricey. I liked the big wood boat they served our sushi on. not my favorite but don't hate it either.
other I just had a pretty unfortunate experience at Bison Witches in Tempe.  I remember liking this place when I went to ASU but not anymore!  It literally (no exaggeration) took 1.other hours for our lunch, which was 3 people eating soups and sandwiches.  Our order took 4other minutes to arrive at our table (again, soup and sandwiches!), and several tables around us that had come in AFTER us, got food before us.  I normally am pretty easy going about stuff like this, but the server and a guy that appeared to be a manager/owner didn't even acknowledge the long wait time, no apology, nothing.  They weren't even that busy!  Our server barely even spoke to us when she came to the table, and acted like we were inconveniencing her.  I also saw her roll her eyes at another one of her tables as they got up to leave.  What kind of service is that!?  I wish I could say the food was any saving grace, but it wasn't.  Mediocre soup in a bread bowl, less than mediocre turkey on a bland sandwich.  I will NOT be going back, there's no point!  Save your time and money and hit up another one of the tasty places on Mill Ave.  Trust me, you'll be better off!
other Can not say enough good about this place.  I love it.  I love it!  I simply love it!  We have always had really great service and the food!  Well, the chips are thin and salty yumness and I love the salsa.  They keep you filled up and aren't like other places which try to ignore an empty container!Number 16 Combo is my guilty pleasure!  I have had it many times the way it's intended:  Chicken enchiladas with red sauce...but lately I've been getting it with Fundito sauce and I've gotta tell you:  I'm hooked!  Try it........it's a little more $$$ but SO worth it!I haven't had desert since I'm gluten free but the size of the fried ice cream is Gigantic.  My daughter swears by it!Man, I wish they were open right now...cravings have begun anew....
other Best latte ever!!!  I missed my local coffee shop in Phoenix and I stumbled upon Echo.  I am so happy I found this place.  Free Wi-fi and AMAZING lattes have won me over!  I recommend the Turkey & Brie sandwich.  The pear made the sandwich.  They have a great music selection and they don't crank up the volume.  Check this place out!
other Nestled between the bright lights of the once famous Graham Central Station and a no-name BBQ place is a lovely gem I like to refer to as "Skips".The bar side of this place is nothing too special. Don't get me wrong, its BIG for a bar, but the ambiance and furniture are pretty dated. So, unless you enjoy playing pool, I don't know why you would want to come here.That being said, the pool here is great!  They just got around 1other brand new Diamond 7' tables which play AWESOME.  Their 9' tables also play well, but they have some PRETTY unforgiving pockets.  So if you are a beginner, I wouldn't play on the big tables unless you like to be frustrated.They have no house cues on the floor.  you have to rent them up at the bar for $1.00.  This is great because they can maintain a better quality cue for you (if you use house cues).Their food is actually REALLY good! I've had their Turkey Burger which was moist and delicious.  It comes with a nicely sized basket of fries.  Also, their Nachos are ridiculous good (That's saying a lot coming from me)! The only bad thing about their nachos is that they use that liquid fake cheese... I prefer shredded blends on my nachos.The waitresses there are uber friendly. Yes, UBER! They always make a point to remember your name and they are always SOOO busy! Make sure to tip them well. They will remember you!Wednesday night is league night there, so unless you want to watch, avoid Wednesday from 7-10pm. Oh, and HH is from 2-7 and lots of the food (including the nachos and Turkey Burger) are priced to sell!Go shoot some pool!
other I am one step closer to completing my goal.  I want to visit every Grimaldis in the US before I die.  After tonights visit to this one, I have most of AZ taken care of.We decided to come here because we had never been to this one.  We arrived and were seated right away.  Surprisingly this one wasn't crowded at all and that was fine by us.  We got a small caesar salad, a small pepperoni and garlic, and a personal white pizza with roasted red peppers.  A few minutes later we got our salad.  It was really good.  Just enough dressing, lots of cheese and croutons.  It was a good starter.  A few minutes after that, our pizza came out.  If you have read my other reviews, you will know that I think Grimaldis is the best.....this pizza was no different.  I really liked the white with roasted red peppers.  Everything was delicious and even though there was some doubt we could finish off other pizzas, I turned on my inner fat boy, and finished off all the pizza.  It was tough, but someone had to do it....little kids are starving in Africa somewhere....lll be damned if I'm going to waste some slices of this amazing pizza.  Down the hatch it went....my stomach doesn't like me right now because its so full, but he will forgive me once he doesn't get any of this delicatessen back in San Diego LOL.
other I went here while on vacation visiting my friend. Neither of us had been there before, but I know they have lots of locations on the west coast, so we gave it a try. The staff was totally rude. Before we went, we called to check the hours. The guy on the phone was patronizing and acted inconvenienced to have to give any information. The pizza was blah - totally generic and nothing special. If you're going to have mediocre food, you better have exceptional service. Double fail.
other The Corner Bakery was A-Ok! To me it seemed like an elevated Paradise/Panera. I had the Cobb Salad and it was perfectly chopped and dressed.  The desserts looked really good but a little on the pricey side for me to try that day. I'll be back because I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the great customer service.
other Consistently a good experience.  Not a fancy place by any means but a great neighborhood restaurant with friendly staff and good food.
3 My first visit to Picazzo's is not what I had hoped it would be at all.  A few of my friends who have fine taste in food raved about it and so I had high hopes.  Let me start by saying, I'm not really a gourmet pizza lover.  As a teacher, I have plenty of Domino's and Pizza Hut all the time, and can be quite happy with that, either that or I love a great slice of New York style pie.  Since I am not a huge fan of gourmet pizza and the overabundance of toppings, I checked the menu for a nice plate of delicious pasta.  I was incredibly unhappy to find that they had about 6 pastas and they all sounded bland and/or too strange to order.  Then, I found their sandwich section.  I decided on their Spicy Chicken sandwich that sounded perfect.  But it took awhile for our waitress to come over, so I glanced at the pizzas and found a couple that sounded good too.  Thank goodness I did, because as I ordered the sandwich, the waitress informed me that they only serve the sandwiches at lunchtime!  What?!  That really peeved me off.  What is irritating is on the menu there is a clear line between the section that says "Lunch Specials" and where it says "Sandwiches."  I mean, there is an actual black line drawn between the two...to me, that says that they aren't a part of lunch.  Don't you think?  Instead I ordered the Popeye and Olive Oyl pizza, which has a white garlic sauce, spinach, artichoke hearts, garlic, Kalamata olives, carmelized onions, mozarella, Roma tomatoes, and Applewood smoked bacon.  After I ordered it, I really thought how I truly didn't even want it.  I was really irritated.  My husband and I both ordered our own pizza since we couldn't agree on what we wanted, so he got The Vortex, which basically had all the meats you could possibly think of.  For an appetizer we ordered the garlic cheese bread, which was way too garlicy.  It came with olive oil for dipping...I would have preferred some marinara sauce or something.  After I had ate the bread, I really didn't want my pizza b/c of knowing that it had so much garlic.  I picked a lot of the garlic cloves off along with most of the other toppings...there was just too much on it.  I know for some, they would probably like that...but it just isn't my thing to have too much on my pizza.  All in all, the pizza was pretty good, once I picked off half of the toppings.  The crust was really tasty and had the perfect crispiness and softness to it.  I could have had just had that alone and been happy at that point.  My husband and I both agreed that it won't be a place we go to again, unless it is for lunch time, so I can try the sandwich my mouth had actually been watering for.
other I am OBSESSED with Ra.  Thank God that it is a chain restaurant otherwise I don't know how I would get my fix when in different states.  I don't care what everyone says about the best sushi, blah blah blah.  This place is THE best!First of all it has the BEST happy hour!  I was introduced to the restaurant's best items during happy hour when it was less expensive to be adventurous.  My absolute favorites are the Sweet Onion Salmon, Salmon Carpaccio and Shishito Peppers.  The Sweet Onion Salmon's sauce is to die for, the Salmon Carpaccio is soft and creamy with a nice kick of wasabi and the Shishito Peppers have the most amazing garlic-type sauce!  I usually order the peppers with a side of white rice and drizzle the sauce on it for a more filling meal.  Other favorites are the RAckin shrimp, Uchi No Salad and Vegas Roll--basically any of the happy hour items are great!Oh and I can't forget about the desserts, if you have any room left you have to try the cinnamon tempura ice cream, but share it because it is very filling.
other I have taken acting classes from Verve Studios on and off for four years, and have recently returned for another work out!Amanda is a true professional,  a working Actor herself,and gets the actor to be real, not "act".  Do not miss this opportunity to learn and grow, AND have fun.Lawannah CurryPhoenix Az
other Sharp looking place modern meets old dinner, good food nice and simple breakfast menu. Staff could have been more friendly, but over all solid place will be back again!
other Second visit to L&L.  The first was at lunch with a group of moms second with my family.  The service was excellent which is saying a lot.  They didn't have to ask what we needed they surveyed the table and kept the meal moving.  Which I appreciated since we had the three kids with us.  This is not traditional chinese, so get the asian nachos.  They are a giant appetizer very unique and quite tasty.  EVERYONE enjoyed their meals and the happy hour deals are pretty good.  I see more visits in my future.
other I have been to Cherryblossom countless times for lunch over the past few years. I have to say the location kinda sucks, but that's because of all the traffic. Are they ever going to finish construction on Camelback?! Any way, I decided to get a to go lunch order today. Since it was actually chilly out, I ordered the cha-shu ramen noodles with a couple of their yummy bread rolls & also picked up a slice of their amazing blueberry bread. The rolls were yummy as usual & I ate half of the cha-shu, so good & a big enough portion for me to have it again for lunch tomorrow. Service can be slow there sometimes, it's best to go at 11am or after 1pm, to beat the lunch crowd. Other tasty items I have enjoyed here are: cali crunchy roll, double shrimp crunchy roll, grilled chicken salad (w/ginger dressing instead), calamari, edamame & I have tried a couple different pasta dishes which were surprisingly good!
other Last time I went it was lunchtime on a weekday.  Our server was very quick and attentive.  The sushi lunch deal was *amazing.*  Piping hot miso, delicate seaweed salad, crisp cucumber salad, flavorful sauteed veggies, fresh orange slices and the main attraction - tuna, yellowtail and salmon all absolutely fresh and perfectly prepared.  I left totally stuffed and happy.  One caveat - they should turn down the music a little during lunch; happy hour should be one level of noise and lunch should be several octaves below that.
other Was in Phoenix for a softball tournament this past weekend and stayed here cause it was one of the host hotels for the tournament.  Front desk staff were friendly and fast so check in was a breeze.  The room was great. Had other double beds in a separate room and a queen size pull out. Beds were comfortable and linens were above normal hotel quality. Bathroom was big...though it contained the closet which was kinda weird. Towels were over sized and very soft. Small balcony was nice.  Parking was in a structure next to the hotel and we never had a problem. Loved the atrium like interior of the hotel. The only cons I can think of were...the elevators were kinda slow....the toilet didn't flush right away and you had to hold the handle down a few seconds....and the hash browns at the breakfast buffet were extremely dry hahahaOver all this hotel is a very nice one to stay at and I would definitely stay here again if I am ever in Phoenix again.
other This place is similar to Rays on 3rd St. It was lunch time I had an eggplant parm sub very good the eggplant was nicely breaded not gooey and gross. The kid had a slice of cheese the slices are HUGE. The pizza and service here are always good. I suggest this place for dinner more so the meals are way better they come with a house salad and they have more options pasta and such. They deliver too.
other The kids and I LOVE Starbucks but this one leaves a lot to be desired.. We have been here a hand full of time and each time I keep asking myself why do I go back to this one? The service there is almost rude. They seem as if they are annoyed to be busy. They never seem to be happy to service you. Drinks take forever to make, even though they aren't as busy as other ones are. We won't even go into the fact that my order has been messed up the last other times.The main issue I have is the fact that 3 out of other times when sitting and relaxing with a snack, someone has to sweep the floor near me. Really? While I am sitting there?There are much better Starbucks and I think I am going to try some others locally.12/06 - The kids and I went in today for our "snack" wanted to say things were better today. I am not going to change my rating until after my next visit ;)
other I am just providing a review for the Mother and Infant Care Department only, since my wife has just had our second baby delivered here.We really enjoy our stay at this hospital. The facility is very clean and nice. Room are good size with shower box inside bathroom, so you can take shower during your stay and care for the mom. During the stay, Mom and the caregiver are entitle to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner for free. All you have to do is call and place your orders. The foods are quite quality and the portions are decent. I am really impressed with this.The nurses are all knowledgeable, caring, and nice. They are always there when you call them and need them. Since this is our second child, it works out perfectly that the nurses only come by when we call them or when they do their routine checks. So, the rest of the time you are left alone to rest. The hospital where my first child was born was different. They let lots of interns and students come to our rooms all the times for training, so we were constantly bothered. However in my opinion, if it is your first child, you may find that having people around all the time could help you not to worry too much (since we all know nothing when the first child come).The reason I didn't give this hospital other star is just because our discharge was taking so long. We thought we would be out by 1other AM, but we didn't get out until 3 PM... They said that because it was on Sunday.  I think it make sense.Overall, I do recommend this hospital for any new mother.
other The vibe exuding from this place is pure awesomeness. Reminiscent of a trendy hipster coffee joint, this is actually a casual vegan restaurant. I am a pescatarian and unless I am eating seafood, I steer clear of meat, even the mock kind usually however once in a while it's delicious... so why try it here at Green I thought. The menu's style is comfort food, which as we all know traditionally is heavy on the meat, sauces, and fat content... so at least if you're going to be bad, you can do it with organic and pure ingredients.So as I wanted to sample as much of the menu as possible, my lovely friend, her fiance, and I shared a few items:*Artichoke Gratine: The corn chips were amazing, lightly salted and crisp. The dip was a bit too garlicky and runny for my liking. Ate a few bites of this but could not see myself eating the entire thing solo.*Spicy Buffalo "Wings": first things first... do not let looks dismay you... true it looks gross but they taste legit! The flavor of the buffalo sauce was perfect, although could have been spicier. And the cucumber ranch dipping sauce was perfectly creamy and lightly flavored as to not overpower the "wings". This dish is a must try!!*Vegan Chili Fries: the fries are thin cut and tasty. The chili sauce was good, at first, but I quickly got sick of the flavor. This could be because I was never a huge chili fan even back when I ate meat. Hmm, I think you are better off ordering the thyme fries.*Crab Puffs: Perfectly crisp with a delicious creamy filling. Another must try!Lastly my friend's fiance ordered that day's special which was a green chili burrito... delicious and huge. A bit too much rice but besides that a great option. It came with a side, which he ordered the curry pasta salad, mmm.Green serves bowls, sandwiches, pizzas, salads... next time I am back in the area I will be checking out more of the menu when craving "meat" and not my usual tofu, seafood, veggie diet.  Might I add the service is friendly. Perfect place for a casual friend date.
other I am really surprised by the previous reviews here. This has been at the airport for many years now.  There is a lot of other places for food, and this is one of the BEST!They have a huge menu, i think and you can even get breakfast.The prices have even gone down. You can get a full meal for under $6.00.That is a screaming deal at Sky Harbor airport. Hard to choose a favorite, but Chicken Delight is really good!! With red or green sause.  Their Salsa is excellent as well. We sometimes get it to go, when through with a trip for our journey home. Hey then you don't have to cook!
other Always a marvelous experience. The patio area is simply lovely if the weather is permitting. The menus are always excellent and they have an excellent staff. The cheese plate is always great to start and the servers will help you pick a good selection of cheeses and suggest very good wines. The food is always very good and also unique -- rabbit is one of my favourite proteins they prepare here. I have been there for Valentine's Day and also for our wedding anniversary and the always make the evening special. It is pricey but worth every penny you pay.
other This will be a simple post...I love indian food, and this is HANDS DOWN the very best in Az. The Chicken makhani is so buttery, so savory...the Chicken tikka masala, the best I ever had. Service is always good, the food comes out fast. It's not super cheap, since you have to pretty much order everything ala cart, but it is worth it. If you go on Friday or Saturday there is also belly dancers. When in rome!
other So far my restaurant experience in Phoenix has been subpar when it comes to service and this one took the cake. Everytime the server came to our table it was just to do one thing and we would be left in the lurch with our mouths silenced in the middle of asking for something. Finally the food came and it was actually quite delicious, I ordered the turkey eggs benedict with potatoes and fresh fruit. However once again the food was dropped off with no silverware, no condiments and no refills on the coffee. I truly hope the restaurant re-trains the staff or hires a whole new batch, because I am afraid food alone can not keep a business afloat.
other There's a reason there's a banner that reads,' Food Network Challenge Winner', hanging in their farmer market booth. I've had Pastry Chef Chris's gingerbread cookies; biscotti; coconut/chocolate cookies; and their carrot cake, and they have all been really, really, reaaaaally good! But today, at the Ahwatukee Farmers Market, I was knocked out by what she calls "Lemon Sunshine."  Words can not describe how delicious their lemon and cream & graham crust tart/pie is.Lemon tarts/pies are among my all time favorite desserts. I thought that the ones I had from TK's bakeries and Veronique Mauclerc were as perfect as a lemon tart/pie could be. Slice Cake Designs Lemon Sunshine pie is dangerously perfect...A must try!!!!!
other love the gyro plate. Rice is so good and I also dig their candy selection :)
other Consistent.  Fresh Mint offers a very consistent product. This is a vegetarian restaurant with a Kosher designationl. The menu is Asian, with traditional dishes served with tofu or just veggies.  The tofu is flavored/shaped as with it's more traditional dish (i.e. Kung Poa has chicken-flavored tofu, Beef dishes taste more like beef).  Personally, I prefer plain tofu over flavored and they will substitute to your taste.  Also, for GF'ers, they do have some dishes that are GF (no soy sauce--such as curries).  No upcharges for any subs or even brown rice...At lunch, hardly a seat is available. It's nice to see that this is more crowded than the fast food joint that is closer to the street.  A slight tention can be felt for the business of the staff; however, this restaurant is consistant every time...it's worth trying folks.
3 Brunch Review:DYNaMITE BLOODYMARYS. Something special.Expensive. Tasty. Friendly staff. GREAT tomato relish on the side. I like to go to brunch here on Sundays. I sit at the bar, and there is usually a sports game on, a good looking bartender pouring me coffee, and a guy with a hangover wearing sunglasses wishing he'd ordered the breakfast burrito sitting next me. Most of the dishes have some southwest/mexican food influencing the cuisine. The BIG 'ol Bistro Breakfast is delicious. I think it might be one egg too many, but the Cappicola and potatoes are delish.The Rojo Chili de La Casa is my go to, unless they have a special like Machaca Tostada's or Country Benedict (with sausage patties in place of Canadian Ham)They are really good about keeping the drinks topped off.
other Sometimes things happen, and when they do this is the place where you want them taken care of. The orthopedics department and trauma department have some of the best, and nicest Doctors you'll find in the state.
other This is a tough one.  I'd found out about Mrs. White's by way of Lo-Lo's, and thought I'd try Mama's food before Son's.  It was good, I'll say that.  I had the smothered chicken and regretted it immensely - fried chicken covered with gravy amounts to a mess of watery breading.  Between that and having to dig through the mess to find the bones, it wasn't exactly a lot of meat down my throat.  Mac & Cheese and white rice as my sides were good.The ambiance?  There IS none.  I found more entertainment from the writing on the wall, which had clearly been painted over MANY times since the 60s, and the open/close sign which reads, if closed, to contact "Jesus".  LOL.Unaware of the church across the street, I arrived right after Sunday services to find the place fairly full - some churchgoers, at least one newcomer party, and several regulars.  Based on the caloric content of the entrees, I wasn't surprised to see about 50% obese customers, while the rest were inexplicably thin.As a Whitey, I can't say that I was comfortable.  Clientele is almost all Black and while they are some of my best friends, I only felt welcome because of the cordial words spoken by our waiter and the cashier at the checkout, who clearly could have beat the crap out of me with one punch.  Other than that, there were a lot of "what are YOU doing here?" looks from fellow customers.  I kept wishing I had brought my sista friend with me, who would have loved this place.I'd go back, but it's not a perfect choice.  Perhaps on a Saturday when church hadn't just let out.  Also, the price is extreme - it's almost as high as Knott's Berry Farm which gives you more food for only about $other more, and that's at theme park prices.  This is just dumpy outskirts of downtown..but again, I don't wanna judge.  I love small business and I'm proud of Mrs. White for making it this long; hope she continues for a long time to come.
other I have been here at least 10 times and have never had a complaint.  The staff is friendly, the food is great, the atmosphere is lovely.  My favorites - the LB lavosh and spicy cottage cheese.I will continue to come back to Local Breeze again and again!
other This is one of my favorite theaters.  It's a little known fact that the first showing of the day for any film is only $5.  This keeps my wife and I coming back.  One of our favorite things is to see a movie at 9am and hit a great spot for brunch afterwards.  And yes, they don't mind when you show up in pajamas with Starbucks.A great time!
other Super friendly. Joe was there greeting everyone, refilling coffee, and sharing how we uses local Arizona suppliers. Great diner food and decor. Loved the biscuits and chorizo gravy.  Will definitely be back.
other I love this arena...maybe I am biased since I am a diehard Suns fan and a downtown resident, but it really is a nice facility.  The Suns games are always well put together...great announcer, great dancers, great entertainment, and great concessions.I attended the last game of the season in a suite Wednesday night and was impressed with the space and the food...actually quite good!
other It's a restaurant in a gas station, but it merits five stars b/c it has glass bottles of soda, just like you find in Mexico.  Good food too.  It's actually not nearly as bad inside as you'd think, it's pretty well set apart from the gas station sales, so I wouldn't mind eating there.  They have a few tables set up inside.  I usually get takeout though (they also deliver).  MANZANA LIFT ROCKS!!!  I'm also going to be drinking the Sprite in the bottle, (cane sugar ftw) and the horchata.  I don't care about Chipotle opening near work anymore, I've found a new Mexican fix for lunch.  What a happy day.
other Now they are using a hand held drill to buff toenails during their pedi instead of just a quick file.  I can definitely see grow out difference on my nail bed.  Not good.
3 I hate the heat. HATE. Yet I am doomed to reside in this heat haven so when my best friend raved about a place where you can sit outside in Arizona and not feel the heat I had to check it out. By the time I ventured downtown to glance at this place Phoenix was experiencing a cool down so the patio was very comfortable without the fans and misters. Our waitress was great and even chatted about our night and my favorite bar, SideBar. We got the L.B. favorite lavosh and I okayed the bacon even though it didn't sound too appetizing. It wasn't. I ordered some chicken sandwich that was on a french roll. The salad on the side was better than the sandwich. My friend ordered the classic turkey which was large but average. BUT I think ordering the classic sandwich was a boring mistake of its own. The fries that came with the turkey were greasy and when I ordered a amber ale and some guy brought a pale ale. I like pale ale so it wasn't too bad but it made me yearn for the amber. Yes, or course I ordered the amber next.The waitress told us that the island bar was opening the next day but there were still ladders and paint cans lying around. I failed to notice until my friend mentioned it. The only really cool thing about this place is that it is in a historic building with strange bathrooms. Other than that I would skip it.
other This place is the truth. It is easily one of the absolute best spots in Phoenix for Sonoran style Mexican cuisine. The chile colorado is so good, it made me try to slap my mama. The red sauce with the chips is actually brewed in the sixth level of hell. Awesome. Fridays feature $1.99 margaritas before 7 p.m. Swing by, start with the cheese crisp, grab any combo and revel in the gluttony.
other We ordered $40 worth of pizza for takeout and it took almost other hours -- was told 20 minutes. We were not comp'd for anything. When I expressed my dissatisfaction, they offered to give me $40 credit toward my next order. I asked for this in writing, and they gave me the "we can't provide it in writing -- we wrote your name down and have you on record" line.Guess what -- I called back a couple months later and they had no record. They refused to honor the credit....and were rude. I asked to speak to the owner, and was told "he's out of town." The pizza is mediocre at best. I have zero tolerance for businesses such as this. PLEASE spend your money somewhere else that deserves to be patronized.
other Save your money and go to Kyoto Bowl. Our waiter gaves us our metal bowls and then coddled my family like we're children. They have all the waiters follow us to get in line for the self-service buffet. They stand there like if you get out of line, you're bad. Weird...During this time, the waiter goes on and on about their food and what they have. Then when you get to the buffet, the choices are very limited and the food is so full of fluff you don't get to put much food in. Some of it is meant to be like sushi, uncooked, but since you put it in a bowl, it gets cooked with everything else. Oh yeah, and the place is loud. You'll have to sit elbow to elbow to hear your family. The novelty about this place is that you can watch the cooks cook your dismal amount on an open fire oven. That's the coolest thing about this place. They serve it in these trendy lopsided bowls. At this point, the food has really shrunk. The food is tasteless. Anyways, they give you the bill and even though somebody else paid for my bill, I was shocked by the price ~ $10 a bowl. If I had $10, I'd rather go to Taco Bell.
other I am not a fan of this place. I like to try to stay positive though so here is my attempt a the proverbial "positive sandwich"Top Bun: The location is fantastic. I really like where it is, its a cute little place that is very easy to find.The Meat of the Matter: The food here is odd. I am very open to trying new things and experiencing different cultures. As I have mentioned in other reviews, I love all types of food from all over the world. I didn't care for this place. I ordered an appetizer that was wrapped in a banana leaf and i honestly thought I was eating an ashtray. It wasn't good. The pad thai that I sampled was very lifeless. I had a friend get a big bowl of soup that looked good but i didn't try it. Lettuce, onions pickles, tomato: The service was not good. I sat at the bar the first time I went here and we got ignored for the most part. The bartender (who i believe doesn't work there anymore, luckily) sniffed at me when I asked for clarification on something. There are also jars of really weird floating things at the bar (probably pickled/preserved veggies/meat/fruits etc.) it was unappetizing to be around....I don't have a weak stomach at all, it was just odd. The second time I went in, the service was equally as bad. there was a table of 8 of us for lunch and the place was mostly dead and I had to go up and ask them to take our order after we sat waiting for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the menu is small and the prices are high with not much room for substitutions or changesBottom bun: I like the owner, he is really nice and friendly. The cooks were also friendly. I like to believe that my taste buds merely didn't care for this place. I know a lot of people that have very positive things to say about this place. I will not recommend it as a personal favorite and I will quite frankly probably avoid it unless it is specifically requested by a client. I am completely fine with the concept that not everyone has to like the same things. I personally have not had a good experience with this place, but I respect the fact that a majority of the reviewers for it have.
other We had a good experience there unlike the others.  Service was very attentive and the food came in a reasonable amount of time.  Husband had the WESTERN BACON CHEESEBURGER and said it was good.  I had the TUNA MELT and thought it was very good.  The fries were the frozen kind, so they got cold fast.  Some restaurants you just can't expect a whole lot.  I give them a other as the service was good, food was good and we were out of there on $2other with tip.
other I had dinner at Frank & Albert's while attending a conference at the hotel. Normal I try not to eat at hotel restaurants due to overcharging and quality of the food. I decided to try Frank & Albert's based on the reviews from Tripadvisor. Tripadvisor rates this restaurant as number two in Phoenix. We where seated on the patio next to the open fire pits. How romantic except I was with my work colleagues. Frank & Albert's is perfect for a date or anniversary. The location is nested in the luxury hotel setting directly below some kind of canyon. I ordered the Fillet Mignon. Yummy!! Everything on the menu looked so good. Frank & Albert's also had a great wine list. My work colleagues were very happy with my dinner choice. I used opentable to make the table reservation. I would definitely come back Frank & Albert's if I was in the area.
other Stingray Sushi is where we go for sushi .Sleek ,beautiful interior and very ,very clean ! This dining house has large 13 or so foot doors that when open ,seamlessly link the patio potion with the interior dining area ,a very good design flow,indeed. The patio itself is very comfortable as it has great seating .The service has always been wonderful ,the sushi very fresh with beautiful presentation .We like to get the sushi boat , edamame ,and beef yakitori.The fire dragon rolls( though on the small side) are also yummy.Drinks are very good here ..the sinful orchid (yum)a very pretty drink .And their HH is really good as well .
other Great BBQ - Friendly staff, super atmosphere and reasonable prices - what else can you ask for? Ribs and BBQ Chicken are my favorite.  Try the Devils spit sauce if you dare.
other I had one of the worst experiences of my vegetarian life here. I had been to Johnny Rocket's before and gotten the vegan option so I knew I would be ok going here. I was out with my meat eating sister and my pescatarian husband so I figured this place would be the best for all three of us to get what we want. We get in and I ordered a burger that wasn't the Streamliner (1st mistake), and just ordered it with the BOCA burger. The waitress takes our order, my husband also ordered his with a BOCA. About 20 minutes later the food comes out. The patty looks right. I was a little apprehensive and I should have gone with my gut feeling on not eating here this day, but I ignored it. It had been awhile since I had eaten a BOCA patty (over a year), so I THOUGHT it looked right. (2nd mistake)I start eating it and about half way through it the bill hits our table. It was crowded in there so the waitress must have been trying to get us out of there. So I look at the bill and notice both my husband and my burgers say Turkey substitution. I immediately start to freak out. We call the waitress over and explain to her that we ordered BOCA, why does it say Turkey? She then tells us that it is BOCA it just says turkey. I say, no that doesn't sound right. So she goes to talk to her manager I guess because we never saw her again. The manager comes over to our table and apologizes profusely for what happened. I'm upset because how the hell do you confuse BOCA and Turkey? I mean, really. I know some people might think how did I not know the difference. And I thought that to myself as well, but the truth is it slipped by me even though it shouldn't have. And it hurts me every time I think about it. I will never come to this Johnny Rockets again, if any of them ever again because of this experience. All I can say is, if you are vegan or vegetarian, and you go to any of the Johnny Rockets, make sure that your waitress/waiter knows that a BOCA burger isn't meat. Stress that to them. Because obviously they aren't trained to know what the difference is.
other Great place and experience. Food and beer cocktails were great. The scene is laid back and fun. There is something for everyone here. Enjoy it for what it is a great retro bar serving old school beer you wont find anywhere else so don't be whining for the latest micro brew or looking for the Scottsdale scene here. Parking is easy in the back alley and side streets. On weekend nights I'd like to see a separate entrance if you want to go just for the food and not have to pay the cover for the band. A fun place for kids too.
other The queso is ridiculously good... seriously. And the homemade tortillas are also outstanding.Aside from that, everything is average at best. As mentioned by others, this is Americanized Mexican cuisine. This is not autentica comida Mexicana, mi amigos!We had been once before and thoroughly enjoyed the food. Hence making it a point to visit again on our most recent trip to Arizona.We started with the chips and salsa set for the table - delicious. I ordered a bunch of queso for the table, and I started with a Tortilla Soup. It was hilariously underwhelming. I made the joke that it was kitchen scraps, and it looked the part. It was light tomato broth with a bunch of vegetables, a gob of cheese and a small corn on the cob on top. Yes, a small corn on the cob is on top. It was lousy and I wouldn't recommend it.We ordered a pound of chicken fajitas and a half pound of vegetable ones (thanks to the vegetarian fiancee). It went surprisingly far for five of us... but the veggies weren't grilled much, which is sad because they were otherwise delicious. Also, the chicken fajitas only had one piece of green pepper and one of red on top. It should be lush with peppers and onions that have been grilled or possibly even caramelized (the onions).Daniel E. wrote in his review the same concern, that there should be "more than a pile of onions," that he expected at least some green, red or yellow peppers. The fajitas were good and quite filling. The accompaniments were decent - cheese, lettuce, sour cream and the like. Nothing fancy, certainly no frills.So much potential, but it fails on almost everything. It's a true shame. This place needs to be on Restaurant Impossible with Robert Irvine... badly...This time around... the service was really lousy. And my fiancee found a bug deep down in her water. Very disappointing. The waitress first replied confirming what size bug it was, and then explained it and claimed that "we're not dirty, it's just the food smell." Then she apologized and walked away. We think she deducted a soda from the final bill... but nothing else. A bug!And the entry foyer smelled like a high school locker room... it was foul on the way in and out.Sad to say that we may likely not return in the future. I'm not sure if our family and friends in the greater Phoenix area will either after the bug incident.
other I cannot say enough about how much I LOVE We Care Family Wellness Center! I refer everyone I know to them. Dr. Ross, Cheryl, and everyone on staff are truly wonderful. They genuinely care about you as a person and always make you feel like you are the only patient on the planet whenever they are with you. They are never rushed and will take all the time in the world to listen to you and figure out what's going on with you. After having seen more doctors than I care to remember, I feel so blessed that I have found such amazing healthcare providers!
other Blah...Very disappointing. I ended up at the San Carlos when it was the only hotel downtown that wasn't sold out. I don't think it was worth the $200 a night, but I didn't have a choice. The shower was amazingly tiny. I felt like I was being frisked up against a wall just to wash my hair.The walls are super thin. I could hear snoring from one room, coughing from across the hall and the TV on the other side....just awful.The staff wasn't very helpful---forgot to program a wake up call, refused to assist when an alarm had been going off in another room for over an hour in the middle of the afternoon, etc. The ghost lounge was very cute...I went down and it was a swing night which seemed to be fun. I'd be willing to come back to the lounge, but not the hotel for sure.
other Restaurant 28 is a solid hole-in-the-wall that's pretty easy to miss, but it's definitely worth a stop.  On my visits I've gotten brisket and other barbecue, and my friends swear by the chicken and say it's some of their favorite chicken in the Valley.  The hush puppies are great- the greens are good too.Another review said it well when they said this place doesn't underseason food.  Every time I've gone it hasn't been bland- it's got some great flavor and it's tasty stuff.It's in a pretty dull area where there isn't much else to do, or I'd be out there more often.  It's a tiny place too but I've never been in and had it be hugely busy or busy to the point that waiting was crazy.Definitely recommended, and I hope they're able to grow and thrive.
other When I walked through the swinging doors around noon on a Sunday, I walked into Hooterville.  Think silicone, fake tans, bleached hair and  teeth and caked-on makeup.  And the men here overdose on testosterone: full of bulk and attitude.  Think sideways baseball hats, torn jeans, flip flops and gold.  Even at noon on a Sunday, they were on the hunt.  Joining me in alienation was my San-Franciscan friend.  We represented the world of natural size and color.  To bring ourselves comfort and escape in this fake world surrounding us, we discussed environmental concerns.  I got the Buffalo Chicken sandwich.  Commensurate with the theme here, this was the biggest breast I'd ever seen.  The sauce was super hot and tasty.  The baked beans had a southwestern flare - with crushed pepper.  My friend got the chili, which he said was slightly spicy hot but not temperature-hot.  I didn't attempt the bucking broncho, for many reasons, but one of them being that there was nothing on it to hold on to.  Too difficult for a delicate northerner like me.
other In my opinion, Zipps is the king of the local sports bars.  They've got decent bar food, great beer specials on Sundays, and I've always had attentive, friendly service.  What more do you want?
other So I finally got a chance to go here for the first time, and YUMMY is the word to describe this joint. My advice get the challah French toast.   My Wife got an omelet it was really delicious too. I need to come back and try the Amanda Burrito.
other Always reliably good.  Great beer selection as well as fabulous "bitch fizz" (ciders, etc.) and cocktails.  Their pizza is outstanding AND they have a healthy menu.  I generally steer clear of chains but this is an exception.
other If you like Houston's, this is like Houston's creepy cousin that isn't quite right.  It's Bizzaro Houstons.  The food is just gross.  I didn't like anything about it.  You do get a TON of food...but none of it is good.  I got the pork tenderloin...it was gross.  I ended up sending the meat back and just ate the mashed potatoes with the sauce...that's all I could stomach.  (The prices are about the same as Houston's, however.)  I couldn't believe how packed this place was...no one at our table liked their food.  A few of my coworkers went there as well and there were no good comments about it.
other Set up a VinVillage event at this place, sight unseen, which I hosted last night. After the glowing descriptions on their website, some of the reviews here, and knowing they are located at CityNorth, I expected much better! Walking in, I did not get the feeling of "upscale" restaurant. Sports on other TVs blaring out over the bar and into the open dining room did nothing for the atmosphere. They had a long table pulled together for our group in the center of the room, but I grabbed a seat at the bar since I was the first to arrive. Took a few minutes, but the bartender eventually gave me a wine list/menu, answered my questions, and proceeded to get my drink. They had a good selection of wines, and some you don't normally find on wine lists at every other place in town.A few others came in and we moved to the table, no problem transferring tabs. Seemed to take a long time between everyone (about 1other of us, though we initially expected 20) receiving their drinks and the time the first apps came out. Granted, they were complimentary (the deal I worked out for my group), and they were quite yummy - especially the spicy tuna on tempura eggplant - so once we started eating, we forgot about the wait. The pate was very rich and served with soft slices of raisin bread. Some were immediately addicted to the bacon-wrapped dates.Everyone ordered a burger of one type or another, some opting for the pre-selected toppings, other customizing and adding sweet potato fries. We confirmed that everyone was on separate checks. My burger came out not quite as rare as I would have liked, but what do you expect when the patty is only 1/2" thick? I am not a big beef fan, anyway. Sauces were good, especially the pungent garlic parm, as were the fries.But then, we waited for the checks...and waited...and waited. Seems the staff didn't begin trying to sort out who had what until at least HALF AN HOUR AFTER everyone had finished eating and plates had been cleared! And none clearly knew how to use the POS system. Those who had cash eventually tired of waiting and just left it on the table. Those of us with credit cards were not so lucky...and several bills had to be re-rung, as they did not include the right items. I had wanted to go back to try the salted caramel milkshake, but it will be a long time before I return.
other I can't believe some of the things I've been seeing people NAG about in their reviews for this new restaurant! I set my standards pretty high for Rice Paper and they did not disappoint! I took my wife on a date here last night because she really loves beef pho, and had been waiting for this place to open up! The atmosphere was very bright and welcoming, as well was our server! He sat down with us and quickly went over what was good and what was popular with most patrons so far. We took him up on a few of his suggestions and started with the fried calamari. I'm not sure what they bread it with but it was delicious, and the squid was perfect; not too soft, not too chewy!For our main course I ordered the Shaking Beef, which was cubed filet mignon served over onions on a sizzling platter in a special sauce, with a side of rice and grilled zuchinni... again on the suggestion of my server! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! My wife got the beef pho... at first I was a bit iffy on it because the broth looked very clear as if it were going to be somewhat watery... but it was VERY well seasoned! Our server told us that the broth stews for at least 1other hours allowing it to achieve the best flavor from the pho spices! VERY IMPRESSED! Yes, it is much pricier than your average pho joint, but I'd rather pay a bit extra for a nice, clean and slightly upscale atmosphere! And the quality of the food is MUCH higher than the mystery meat you'll get in your bowl of pho at some other places! Well done Rice Paper, we WILL be back!
other As a vegetarian and sporadic health nut, I just love TJ's. They have a nice array of inexpensive fresh produce, including my beloved broccolini, for 40% of what Safeway charges. Huge selection of frozen veggie-friendly dinners, good for my on-the-go household. Greek yogurt, cheap. Nice beer selection with lots of cheapo wine. I try to buy all my supplements here too, as they seem to be a lot less expensive. Yes, I'm all about saving cash on groceries and whatnot.The downside? It's not one-stop-shopping; a trip always requires supplementation with another trip to a "regular" grocery store. This particular TJ's is teeny-tiny-small, and always chock-full of obnoxious and/or oblivious people who wield carts like weapons. My favorite is the woman who thinks it's an awesome time to teach little Jimmy how to push his own wee cart and comparison shop, and lets the little bastard cruise all over the store willy-nilly. I'm all for giving your kid responsibility, but a) you still have to, you know, keep an eye on the kid and b) a super-crowded claustrophobic nightmare like this place after work is not, repeat, NOT the time to do so.
other I'm in town for business and the guy at the front desk of the hotel recommended this place and it was a definite winner!Drove up, and frankly it's not in the best neighborhood but the guy in the parking lot keeping watch over the cars in the lot with a "Security" t shirt on put me at ease. Sat down and was welcomed immediately and offered the fresh chips and incredibly hot red and green salsa.  Although, I'm kind of a pansy when it comes to hot and spicy.  I Just ate the chips plain and they were wonderful.Had the Chicken Mole Enchiladas which were undeniably the best I've had.  The mole sauce was perfectly made with just the right amount of chocolate.  I have the stains all over my shirt to prove it!  The beans and rice were nice accompaniments.  Everyone knows the traditional "Mexican" restaurants where you go in and order the # 13 and they're all the same right?  Rosita's Place is NOT this type of eatery.  The food is authentic as authentic comes and should not be missed.
other Bike cabs beware! You've got nothing on this rig! Tour de Tavern is a tribute to tipsy teamwork and a perfect way to host a unique group event. As "pedalers" on their inaugural tour, we enjoyed the celebrity treatment of cruising down the winding streets of Old Town Scottsdale as onlookers snapped photos and cheered us on!We rocked out to top 40 hits and, by special request, our Lonely Island favorites on their awesome sound system. Our guides were flexible and let our party run the show. If we needed more time for let's say...... an impromptu horseback ride in front of Shotgun Betty's, they were more than happy to wait. As an added bonus everyone gets to burn off some of those unwanted cocktail calories in between your favorite watering holes. If you are concerned that after a few stops (and a few shots) your legs might lose some of that forward momentum, there are a few coveted "non pedaling" seats in the back of the bike. We all compromised with a friendly and fair rotation system. Our tour guides were helpful, accommodating, and entertaining. They even proved to be exceedingly patient upon discovering that we did in facts have "that guy" in our group. If you're saying to yourself,  "Such a marvelous experience could only cost an arm and least the majority of a leg" then you would be wrong! With the cost of gas being substituted for sheer earth friendly man power, our group of fifteen people spent less than $30 bucks each for the experience.But wait, there's more! Included in this price are all the amazing special deals that Tour de Tavern exclusively brings you at select bars along the route. On our tour we were offered drinks specials ranging from $3 to ONE PENNY!  I say this in all caps because it's ONE PENNY!So next time you are planning an event, I recommend Tour de Tavern 100%!"Look Ma! No hands!"
3 Lately, I've been on the hunt for a good shrimp po boy. I'm not sure if this compulsion was spurred by homesickness for New Orleans, the food challenge show featuring other famous NOLA po boy joints, or both but I've it seems the last few weekends I've found myself dreaming of that crusty bread "dressed" with lettuce, tomato, and mayo, and golden deep fried gulf shrimp. I happened to notice Baby K's one day and decided to try it out. To be honest, I wasn't even really that hungry but I wanted the po boy and I didn't know when or if I'd have the opportunity to go back to Town and Country mall any time in the near future. The inside was empty but they have a FrenchQuarter-esque patio complete with wrought iron fence. The bf and I both ordered the half pb with a cup of gumbo. I'm a bit of a gumbo snob bc I feel I can make it better than any restaurant can but theirs was really good! They had 3 different kinds which was nice and it was seasoned perfectly. There wasn't a bite that didn't have meat in and the broth was just right. The shrimp on the pb was succulent and almost tasted as if it was battered in beignet mix as the fried was light and airy. I didn't indulge in any libations but they do have Abita and a few other New Orleans beer classics. If I find myself in the area again I'd probably go back but this time I'm ordering a whole po boy!
other I'm a sucker for popcorn, so when I saw a "now open" banner along with the "My Popcorn Kitchen" sign today, my car swerved around the parking lot and grabbed a spot right in front.  I swear, it was out of my control!It turns out, today was the first day this adorable little popcorn/candy shop was open... so lucky me, I get FTR (first to review)!Kim Brush, the owner, was front and center, and welcomed me as I walked in.  She also had a team of people working there that I assume were all training.  They were friendly although it was obvious that I was one of the first customers, so it took longer than necessary to package up my small bag of kettle corn.  The customer before me appeared to have been waiting awhile on her large bag of Puppy Chow (which looked pretty amazing).  The kettle corn I ordered was just the right balance of sweet and salty.  I had to dig deep to exercise my self-control and not demolish the entire bag in one sitting!I took a menu to go as well, and now as I look at it, I can't wait to go back to try more of the unique gourmet popcorn flavors.  Not only do they have the basics (Buttery and Low Salt), but they have all kinds of savory flavors including several different cheeses, Dill Pickle, Salt & Vinegar, and Southwest Jalapeno.  If you're more of a Caramel person, they've got you covered as well, and of course there are a rainbow of Fruity Delights and Decadent Chocolate flavors too!  Popcorn Bags come in all sizes from Mini to Party and range in price from $other to $149.95.  You can also order tins, boxes, and/or pots of popcorn and this place ships anywhere in the U.S.A.Congrats on your Grand Opening, My Popcorn Kitchen.  Let the popcorn parties begin!
other In 2006, I returned to the P A M after a long absence.   I went to see a locally produced exhibit, (Judith Leiber,) which I thoroughly enjoyed and so I renewed My Membership.   Now at the time I was spending a good deal of time with My new granddaughter, Jade and started to bring Her to the Events and Exhibits.   Her first time was to the Cowboy Artist of America and at the time She did not speak much, Yet by the end of the event, She could say; "Cowboys!" (and the Artists always make an effort to, Draw Upon Her.)    Since then I have seen Rembrandt, special guests; The Tudor Tailors, Diego Rivera (with Frida Kahlo),  Author Michael Blake (with His Son) and much more.  As far as being, Good for Kids?!  My granddaughter, Jade's love of going to the P A M has made Me a bigger fan than ever.  ~Please View Pictures~
other high quality sushi fish. expensive. good atmosphere. good service.
other I feel like an East Coast gangster when I roll up to LGO for breakfast. I'll take the Jersey Girl... pump fist and hair toss!! Hands down, it's the BEST omelette I've EVER had. And the fresh-squeezed OJ hits the spot. After a hike at Camelback, it's relaxing to come and sit on the patio... if you can find a spot. Weekends this place is a zoo!! During the week is pretty crazy but has its peaks. The French Toast is pretty tasty and they do pastries just right. Muffins are baked fresh, toast is always spot on perfect. I want their toaster!I've had the pizza, which is pretty decent but not the best I've eaten. The salads are delish.
other Good drinks, great food, and cool music. There is a stage right behind the bar. We tried the Fingerling Potatoes in Tomato Jam and it was fantastic.. I recommend.
other I am not one to hang out in Downtown Phoenix before or after an event because quite frankly it's boring.  However, when I visited Copper Blues on 2/4/1other prior to the comedy show next door I will definitely be hanging out after events.Here's Why ... They have a live band and over sixty beers on tap.  It's a nice cozy environment especially if you sit outside.  Budweiser drafts were only $other and soda was only $3.  We didn't try their food but I hear the same owner owns both Copper and Stand Up Live so I am sure the kitchen is the same so I am confident in saying that the food is delicious because it was at Stand Up Live.Happy hour is 4PM to 7PM Sun-Thurs so its basically perfect when any event is taking place during on those days.On this Satuday night people were having a good time.  The draft beer was perfect and fresh.  The music was good and the bartender was real friendly and answered all of our questions cheerfully.We had such a great time that me and my wife are going back to Copper Blues on 2/23/1other to hang out and drink with friends prior to our comedy show next door.This is a nice spot and you have to check it out especially if you are going to the show next door !
other Nice car-wash with reasonable prices and decently friendly staff. I can tell the staff is used to dealing with the older gentleman types versus the hip and fun 30-something female SUV driving Mom types, but that's ok. The Mom-mobile was detailed just right, the wait wasn't too long, and the air freshener lasted more than 1/other a day. Way way better than Cobblestone Spa over on Bell Rd.
other I LOVE LOVE LOVE Paws Salon. I used to take my dog to Canine Preferred but the ladies at the front dest were flakey, so I thought I'd try a new place and I am SO glad I did. The owner Tracy clearly has a passion for animals. Walking in you are greeted by a cat, dog, and Macaw that call the front of the shop home. You are able to see them grooming the dogs (a big plus for me, you never know what some places do behind closed doors). She is very professional and seems like a no bullshit kind of lady (in a good way). She's to the point, tries to listen to exactly what you want and offers options and suggestions to help. They keep track of the previous cut that was given (it's annoying some places you to have to tell them every time). I would highly recommend this pet salon. They also offer daycare, and overnight boarding. I can't want to try the daycare to socialize my pup some more! Can't go wrong at this salon..
other This place was the worst place to EVER live! I lived here from Aug 2010 to may 2011, i was always in the office see when the grates would be fixed?? the office always gave me the run around very rude. You would think after the gun shoots, assaults, and car break ins that they would fix the gates but nope and to this day they still aren't fixed. When we moved in they said they would be fixed in a week and they lied.  Also the gym is huge but NONE of the equipment works! living here was SO gross! nothing worked our neighbors are Mexican thugs doing drug cat calling at anything that walks it was gross. I hated living here!  But the worst part was a few weeks ago we get a call from collections saying we owe Scottsdale Springs $300 bucks over 10 months after moving out! I called them up like wtf, and they were SO rude said too bad pay it or your credit score will hurt, we even gave a fowarding address and we NEVER got a letter in the mail about any damages. They claim we never gave them a forwarding address which is bull. I really hope people read these reviews i would hate to see anyone else scammed by this god awful company!
3 Alright, so how does it go from being a 1-star (actually, less than that) to being a 3-star review? Simple, they seem better than the last time I was working/shopping here. I went here the other night to help my boyfriend find an interview outfit and noticed that the store had a handful of the same employees as they did back in the Summer, but certain areas of clothing had been moved around. Despite all the moving and switching around they must have done, the store seemed really clean and in order. In fact, I really have no issues with this store except one, teeny tiny, little problem...the check out girl!I remember her from when I worked here and she gave me attitude when I needed to ask her something. Turns out, it wasn't a one time thing.. she's just a rude person. On this particular night, there were only two check out girls and a line of about 1other people. My boyfriend and I were making seperate purchases and knew one of us was going to get her. I happened to get the friendly one, but before we each paid for our items, we were watching as the rude girl didn't crack even ONE half-hearted attempt at a smile. We listened as she rudely explained to some elderly ladies why a certain item was marked on sale but the same item was normal priced. They wanted to make sure they weren't paying too much/too little and her explanation?: "That ones been the store longer." It didn't make sense to them, or to those of us in line watching, but she kept getting huffy about it until they dropped the issue. She shoved people's items in bags and practically threw them at them and said, again without trying to fake some kind of customer service, "Have a good night. Bye. NEXT!" Yuck.My cashier was slightly more frienldy, but still not awesome. It was obvious she was having a long night (afterall, she was stuck at the register with the Ice Queen), so it was understandable. Also, I didn't catch her name, but the girl working in the dressing rooms was really sweet and kept greeting everyone that came by. I had to call this location to get the name of the manager for something I was filling out on a form and I was told they've got a new manager. Thus, I know why this jumped up two stars. It could have been four, but certain things they haven't fixed (rude cashier girl) have kept this review at a solid three.
other At first I was hesitant about trying Prado out because of some of the reviews. I got the impression that I may in for a hit-or-miss experience. And it was my fear that I'd catch one of their "miss" days. I was pleasantly surprised when I had an absolutely sublime meal! Since the menu changes nightly, I won't bore you with details of the meal. I'm a huge fan of restaurants using local, organic produce &/or meats....and I'm a bigger fan of Prado b/c of this! The resort and the restaurant is extremely sexy! You really do feel as if you've traveled to Spain. I encourage people to take advantage of the local gem!!Bon Appetite!
other Excellent burgers and sweet potato fries
other Ok food. Super slow!! 3 employees and other customers and I could not believe how long it took for a quesadlla which was cold when I got it...the tacos were decent though....Give it a try and you decide though..
other Beer...or Yoga?Located in a small center just east of Four Peaks Brewery in Tempe (a reasonable distance from the light rail on Apache), is an amazing, classy studio for the Mind-Body connection.Mr. Mustachio had decided after doing a couple yoga classes with me at the ASU gym that he loved the stretch, so pursued a class for a semester at ASU this Spring and had the pleasure of practicing with Tish Hegel. After seeing his body transform to only 16.2% body fat, all his jeans get too big on him and fill out his American Apparel briefs nicely I was super jealous. He raved about his teacher and I could tell he had de-stressed a lot since he started the practice.Luckily, she opened up a studio recently, and it simply goregous. The waiting area is filled with yoga material and a very calming space with a remodeled bathroom and dressing rooms to change if coming from work/school. Not at all cheesy like the SouthWest Inst with the way too many angels imagery (creepy!). But the gem is truly the practice space. Hardwood floors, high ceilings, a beautiful staircase, tasteful decorations and absolutely NO MIRRORS.  That is right- the only person staring at my pudge rolls is my teacher and who-ever isn't focusing on their tree posture-not the entire class! It really relieves a lot of stress  and helps me concentrate on how a posture feels as opposed to just looks.As for Tish Hegel, she is simply outstanding-she has so many credentials, you have to read her biography for yourself. She has been practicing for a loooong time, and her hands-on instruction and confident voice echoes in my ears even now (bring those shoulders down!). So far, I have done:  Ashtanga Inspired Flow (pretty intense, really hurt for 3 days, would recommend after getting into yoga for a while), Sivananda (ditto),  Focus Class (did a lot of bike riding and she focused on everybody's body issues and did the sequence right then and there for us and my lower back and knees felt amazing the day after) and this morning brought my friend to Kinetic Yoga: Morning Movement and Flow, which kicked our 6am asses a little bit but we both felt amazing afterwards!  She does tons of modifications, is always making sure we are okay, and is just super personable.I did the huge package since I didn't renew my ASU gym membership for this summer, but you can do drop-in. Now for the cliched Yoga Review ending: NAMASTE!
other Angel Sweet Gelato is a welcome treat on a hot day. It sits in a small strip in the middle of Mesa Riverview, but if you can find it (west of Logan's), it's worth a stop.The selection of flavors is large, including a dozen dairy-free fruit flavors that aren't quite as decadent as the dairy gelatos in the left-hand case. I've tried the lemon and all the berry flavors, and haven't found anything that wasn't delicious. The prices are reasonable, and you can order sizes from one small scoop to a big box (all unfortunately served in styrofoam).There isn't a lot of seating in Angel Sweet, but I've never seen it full. Get a punch card if you live in the area. If you like firemen, this would be a good place to see them hanging out.  =)
other What a fantastic experience!  If there is a high-end food product that you don't find at whole foods, then you may find yourself to be one of the pickiest eaters known to man.  This place offers everything under the sun.  For the love of God they have almost 30 different types of olives!My family is new to shopping here and we like to splurge a little bit.  For some reason it's comforting to know that there are other different kinds of ribeye and what seems to be almost 100 different types of cheeses.  I guess realizing that makes me think that there won't be anything forgotten at Whole Foods.  Unlike Sam's Club, Whole Foods gives samples that actually taste delicious and almost make you grab for seconds when instead you just grab an actual wrapped portion of the product (darn, had to buy some sometime).On a 'grocery store' level, this Whole Foods gets other stars that's for sure.  The only reason it gets knocked a star is because some Whole Foods locations offer more services to make their guests feel like it is supposed to be much more than your typical grocery store.  This is a location where I think the patrons would be willing to use everything that they had to offer if given the choice.
other I haven't had this in a while so I can't really give a ton of detail but I have been here a few times. It's a traditional japanese restaurant and from what I remember the food was decently priced maybe a little more expensive for dinner than other places. The thing I remember about this place that I really liked were the lunch bento boxes. They had a ton of food and miso soup and all that and they were a great deal, I don't know how much they were but it was very cheap for what you get. The service is only average but for a cheap lunch with more traditional sushi I would definitely hit this place up.
other had the bulkogi mini plate. very cheap at $5, but it's not really bulkogi - more like a thin steak with very sweet barbecue sauce - and the rice was too sticky. the lone bright spot of the meal was probably the potato-mac salad.
other The contemporary and American art sections of this museum are other stars, outstanding! I also loved the overall museum layout and architecture.
3 This used to be my favorite fro-yo place.  A couple of years ago, I would have given them a 4, but lately I am noticing there is no real rotation on the flavors. Always the typical cookie monster, chocolate and vanilla.  My favorite is Pistachio, I haven't seen it here.  I am addicted to fro-yo, but if I am going to indulge, it better be special.  The location is nice, and I know I will be back if I am in the area and one of the cravings hits.
other Feels a lot like That's a Wrap (which used to be in this location).  I love the overhead door; I love fresh air.  Lots of seating and a bike rack (that doesn't really properly serve a lot of bikes, honestly).Food was very, very fresh.  I expected (per norm in most places) corners to be cut where not noticeable (see: frying something often masks it's lack of freshness) - corners were not cut.  The three things ordered were all well prepared, fresh and delicious.  The things I oversaw on other tables were also looking mighty tasty.I'd love to see a few bottles of craft beer here - that's my personal opinion.  Part of the issue is local laws, the other part is those running the show.Will return, for sure.
3 I prefer this location of Sephora over the Scottsdale location. The Chandler location is less busy and more spacious than the Scotts location. When I first started going to this location I thought it was great because the staff was way more helpful and willing to give out samples. I am now finding the staff to be a bit annoying. They are great, but everytime I look at something they come over and ask a lot of questions or try and steer me to buy a particular product. It gets a little annoying to have the Bare Escentuals Smokey Eyes pointed out at least three times every time I'm in the store. All and all I love Sephora no matter what location! It's heaven on earth for most of us gals. Yes the products are pricey, but they are quality products you can't get at the drugstore.Hmmm, this review must sound confusing. Here I am saying I prefer this location, but then complain about how overly eager the employees are. This location isn't as snooty as the Scottsdale location and the employees are friendlier.
other Perfect location for breakfast before SF Giants spring training game. Also, Perfect location for drinks and snacks after the game. Enjoyed 3 meals in two days and will recommend to all my friends.
other I won't be back here.Most cheap drive through fast food Mexican places are alike. Of course there are slight differences. In this case it wasn't for the better.We had to drive up to the window to order. The speaker box wasn't working? What was going on there?I ordered a chicken chimichanga with sour cream & guacamole on the side. The chimi was big, just like I expected it to be. There wasn't much guacamole. I would have liked more. They also put tomatoes in it. That's ok, I'm just mentioning it. All in all this chimi just didn't sit as well as others I've had. Maybe it was the spices they used that were different, I'm not sure.I also ordered a large horchata. I have definitely had better. It wasn't the worst I've ever had but it needed more cinnamon flavor, that's for sure.It's cheap, it's easy, it's fast, it's literally right down the street from me. I'd still rather make the drive over to 7th St to my fave 'bertos though. See: http://www.yelp.com/biz/rolbertos-phoenix
other My wife and I have going to this restaurant on Thursday night for past three months to have a beer and a slice.  A couple weeks ago I went there for the usual but there was an NFL game and a World series game on and the restaurant was busy.  I put my name in and waited for my wife and the table.  30 minutes went by and wife had not shown up and the table had just become available.  Hostess said I can't seat you unless your other party shows up first.  I called my wife, she cancelled.  Hostess would not seat me as a single...TERRIBLE..Hostess did not tell me this when I first put my name in.  WON'T BE GOING TO ANY OF THE ZIPPS EVER AGAIN.
other Talk about options!  It's almost unfair to have so many items on a menu.   Especially when the food is so good.  I have gone to the Cheesecake Factory several times and have not been able to even put a dent in the menu.So, I wasn't too hungry this time, so I decided to order from the small plates menu.  We started with the corn fritters.  Then I ordered the shrimp and grits and my husband ordered the hibachi steak.  The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because we didn't get our appetizer until the our food was ready.  And by that time, we had already stuffed our faces with bread and butter (which is delicious)!  The server apologized for delay in bringing our app and the manager came by and didn't charge us for the corn fritters.  That was much appreciated!  We only had one of the fritters since our other dishes were in front of us and we didn't want those to get cold.  I really like the shrimp and grits.  I think the dish came with a little too much sauce...but that's just me....I just really liked the taste of the cheddar grits.  My husbands steak was really really good!  The hibachi steak is what I normally ordered. I will go back again!
other I had a craving for Mexican- American type food, and since there is no longer a Chi-chi's around my friend suggested we go here since I was visiting the area from out of town. She is a frequent diner here, and loves it.  I really enjoyed my experience as well. I love a great Chimichanga along with  re-fried beans and ordered a much  needed strawberry  Margareta.  So lovely!!!! I enjoyed everything on my plate! I Loved it so much I suggested we come back my last night in town for drinks and appetizers.We decided to order the  Mini Chimi Sampler, Macayo's Famous Cheese Crisp that I ordered with ground beef (it almost looked like a cheese crisp pizza),Guacamole Dip with chips. They also offer free salsa and chips every time you arrive.Like my friend- I would be a regular here. I know when I visit my friend that she and I will go back- at my suggestion and to  her delight!
other I was last at this place in 2004, and it was great.  My favorite band was playing and I had a great time dancing, drinking and just listening to music.  It's a must-see for any rhythm and blues fan.  Of course, it wasn't open when I just visited.  Ah well.  But still a good place to catch a show.
other Its not a standard restaurant as it is in the middle of a grocery store...but thats just what it is get over it!  The food however is fantastic!  I ordered the samosa chaat...A samosa covered in chick peas and other sauces and chatney.  A delicious Punjabi snack!  The portion was very generous and the price cheap.  I also recently ordered a dozen samosas to bring home and serve at a dinner party.  Very convenient and good service.  I will be a regular from now on!
other Food was really good. You could tell it's good quality. Our service was not so good.  Workers are friendly but were having bad day on service.
3 Sherwin is old and not very reliable but he is a really nice guy. I will give him that much. Very good optician as well
other I have visited MacAlpine's a few times, and every time I have been very pleased with both the food and the service.  The wait staff and the owners are always very friendly and helpful and the food, although nothing fancy, is always good.  I love the atmosphere of this restaurant as well as the neighboring thrift shop that is fun to browse while the food cooks.  And the egg cream sodas are delicious!  Not to mention visiting a piece of Phoenix history at the same time - I love it!  The only downside to this place? I wish they were open later into the evening...
other This, my friends, is THE place to get some very authentic Chinese food. The servings are HUGE for what you're paying...shucks, they are huge no matter which way you look at it so be careful not to order too much food unless you want leftovers. Who doesn't like leftover Chinese food anyway?My recommendations are the Sweet and Sour chicken, the Egg Foo Yung and the chow mein. You will not be disappointed.You'll also find the soups on the back of the menu at an average of other bucks or so. You will be pleasantly surprised when you get the bowl...it can feed at least 6 people. She will bring small bowls out and serve it for you right at the table. Give the hot and sour soup a try.As for the service, it depends on how you look at it. Don't be afraid to get up and refill your own water. Shoot, the waitress is the only one that's there, give her a break already. She must own the joint with her husband because there is always this little kid in the corner playing on his laptop. So, get your own water and your own take home containers if you want. She doesn't have a problem with it.Yes, the place is a little worn but you don't go there to look at pretty stuff. It's not dirty, just broke down. You'd be broke down too if you practically gave away your food in abundance to your customers. Who has money for new furniture if you take care of your customers bellies.  The lobster, crab and fish are fresh and cheap. Try finding lobster somewhere else in the valley for 10 bucks a pound, I dare ya. So, head on out, just don't go on a Wednesday, that's their day off. They are open 11AM to 11PM every other day though. You can call in your order and pick it up if you don't want to look at the place.Oh yeah, and if you ever go in there and it smells horrid, it's not the place, it's a popular dish that some customers order called "Salty Fish". It stinks to all heck! If that plate comes out I usually pack up my food, giggle and finish my meal at home. I don't mind one bit, that's just the way it is.Oh and the waitress does speak good English, however, you wont find many Caucasians frequenting this place. That means the food is pretty authentic!
other The shaved ice at Bahama Bucks reminds us of vacationing in Hawai'i! Lots of flavoring options, and a cheap date!  Haven't tried the smoothies yet, but we heard they're great!
3 While staying at The Pointe Hilton Tapatio, we decided to eat here for our anniversary dinner. To sum it up, I've had everything better somewhere else. Nothing blew my socks off. Hubby is eating mostly vegetarian right now (due to a health concern), and he did really like his "wild mushroom" rigatoni. We weren't sure what was so "wild" about criminis and portobellos, but the pasta was in a light sauce with plenty of other veggies. His French Onion Soup was better at Capital Grille, my antipasto plate was far better at Craftsteak, and my ribeye was far better at 1130. They did serve a neat wedge of au gratin potatoes- multiple paper thin cheesy slices cut into a triangle. The gins are standard, but Hubby had a nice Bonny Doon Riesling. The free anniversary creme brulee was on the runny side, the vanilla was indiscernible, and the sugar crust was too thick- Ruth's Chris still wins that one in my book. Did I feel dinner was worth $120? Not so much.The service at dinner was great, and it was fine at breakfast. Again, everything was decidedly mediocre and way overpriced. I've had a better Belgian waffle at IHOP, my bacon was limp, and the coffee not what I would expect from the Hilton. Hubby's BLT breakfast bagel was better.Come on, Hilton! Is this the best you can do?
3 I've been wanting to try this place for awhile after hearing good things about it and reading the menu. I realize now why the website doesn't list prices-- the mission is hideously overpriced!We ended up on the patio since they weren't seating in the main area yet (at 6:30pm? For reals?) Our waitress was nice and attentive. She noticed my water had something floating in it and replaced it quickly. My husband's water glass was dirty too. She brought us out two sample size frozen peach and strawberry margaritas which were awesome. Much better than the rocks margarita.No complimentary chips and salsa which would be ok if they offered something else like Barrio. No happy hour either which was disappointing.The street corn was good, but I've had much better. The butternut squash tacos were out of this world. My husband liked them better than his mahi tacos. I just can't believe they have the gall to charge $1other for 3 tiny (3 inches in diameter) tacos. They also charge $1other for guac made from other avocados. I'm not sure how they have survived in this economy. They must be very slow when the tourists leave for the summer.
other Drinking coffee from Cartel makes me want to get my own San Franciscan SF-25B Coffee Roaster, in much the same way I wanted my own pottery wheel after seeing the movie Ghost.It's. That. Good.
other other star for service, but the food is not ok :( they literally put other pieces of chicken on my taco. I let that go & figured was a mistake. When I went again, ordered different item & same result. Little to no meat. I will not be going back.
3 Was visiting Phoenix and wanted to try some of the best place.  Tacos Atoyac kept coming up so I decided to give it a try without reading all the reviews (was recovering from the cold a week before so did not want to do much reading) . It should not be bad if the reviews are all other and other stars. Came here on 12/23 evening close to 7pm.  Parked the car right in front and seemed no one was in there. It turned out they were closing early that night.  The menu was small and don't offer much explanation (I guess they figure everyone knows what's taco and burro) Place was clean but smelled like smoke when we walked in. Looking at the price, I figure the taco was small and confirmed with the big, tall white tattoo guy behind the cashier, so I know how many to order.  My parents wanted fish tacos (they only know Rubio's fish tacos and burritos *roll eyes*) and I ordered some al pastor and asada tacos.  Since I am from LA, I am spoiled with cheap, good tacos.  The ones from Tacos Atoyas was only a okay compare to the ones in LA.   Usually the tacos I have are overflow with meat, but these are only half way filled.  Taste was a okay too.  They also ran out of beef tamale that night which my dad wanted to try.Anyway... other 1/other stars? I don't think so.
other I finally found a reasonably priced salon and a stylist who understands what I want.  Very happy with the service.  Also, the waxing lady is very nice...I think her name is Maria, does good eyebrows.  Only downside is that sometimes it is hard to get an appointment on short notice...but that's my fault for waiting until I can't stand it anymore to get my hair cut.
other Great sandwiches! the bread was superb. I had a BLTDA (Bacon, lett, Tomato, date, apple) w/chicken. Yummm. such a cute spot.
other Lunchtime out with a relative on a weekday, and La Condesa has a seat by the window. There is really nothing like its saloon-artsy walls for us to gaze.   The Dia De los Muertos motif and wooden furniture make it perfect for easy conversation.  Most folks seated around us already know where to go for lunch that's not too pricey and homemade.  The Horchata is nothing short of liquid dessert, filled with pecans, fruit and rice milk.  You can avoid dairy all together with this and a special bullet burro with guac and lettuce.The salsa bar sets the standard for good restaurants.  It's wide variety of salsas leave little doubt what creative people run the place.  My hope is that only a few people read this and try it. Otherwise, to my chagrin, the next time we park on 16th Street, we may have to WAIT in a line outside.
other This review was posted over a year ago, however, it was removed by Yelp HQ only last week.I'm reposting it after making some minor modifications, mainly since the response and comments were so positive.... by everyone except Yelp HQ.Whole Foods Market.Ladies, you're young and vibrant...today. But as the years drag on, you notice changes. Subtle changes, such as:*crow's feet*saddlebags*sagging butt and or tits, *and orange skin from all the tanning products, your complexion now resembling that Louie V handbag you've been toting your Shitzadoodle around in.You've got a choice to make.Spend all your money now on organic, free range shit, this in an effort to remain healthy looking, or, shop for a lot of the same stuff at Costco, where you can load up, get twice your money's worth, and have a shitload of cardboard boxes you won't have a clue what to do with. But the real bonus will be how in only a few short years, you'll have saved enough money for a good plastic surgeon, which you're going to need anyway if you have any plans to remain living in Scottsdale for any length of time.My opinion?I highly recommend the latter and here's why.Scottsdale has a serious shortage of fish-lipped women with feline looking facial features, who routinely wear yoga pants telegraphing their hiked-up thongs. Poor thong....how sad that your fate...to be cast to a fifty-something, saggy-butt host.Ladies, is that what you want?To idly standby, watching, as the ranks of this bass-cat looking oddity dwindle in population?I didn't think so.The choice is yours.Beautiful and broke from shopping at Whole Foods today.Or, aging not so gracefully with the help of medical science, an overzealous plastic surgeon, and Victoria's Secret, which I assure you with one of her thongs in yoga pants will be anything but. A lot of good all that free range organic crap did. If you do come here, try the hot deli, where you can get every kind of ethnic food, save for Ethiopian. It helps after a late night at work, on your way home, when you don't feel like eating fast food. They also have a taco and pizza bar, fresh bakery, and a smoked meats section where you can get some of the worst barbecue and smoked meats I've ever tasted. The only thing I'll recommend in this place other than the hot deli, is the chocolate and coffee bar, which seems to have a ton of delights that are supposedly good for you. I doubt it.
other I've been meaning to Yelp for a looong time now, and after having brunch at Scramble today, I thought it only fitting that I give them my Yelp virginity.My boyfriend and I arrived around 1pm and it was pretty quiet. There was a young lady at the counter, taking orders, and another stocking juices nearby. Both were very friendly. I requested a vegan menu (the vegan options didn't seem to be listed on the large menu near the door), which was quickly furnished to me. There were other tofu scrambles, a soy chorizo breakfast burrito and french toast as possible choices. I couldn't decide between the veggie scramble or the french toast, so... I ordered both! My boyfriend went with the bacon and mushroom omelet (off the regular menu). We were offered bread options of white, wheat, rye, or an english muffin. The side dishes were fruit or sweet potato hash... and I think a lot of the menu items come with rosemary potatoes, but we both opted for the hash. The cashier gave us our number. It was a beautiful day, so we found a table outside.In a matter of very few minutes, our food had arrived. I noticed that the vegan items were on red plates to differentiate them. My scramble was yummy, with a good enough amount of veggies in it, and a bit more wet than most other scrambles I've had. I did find myself wishing the portion was a bit larger. The order of french toast came with 3 good-sized pieces and was super duper good.The highlight for me, was the amazing sweet potato hash! It's served in a patty and is chock full of onions, zucchini, carrots (I think) and seasoned with rosemary. I've never had anything like it. I highly recommend it.My boyfriend did seem to enjoy his omelet and definitely agreed with me on the hash.Scramble is a great place, especially considering their vegan breakfast options, which are far too few-and-far-between in the valley. We will absolutely be back!
other Great subs, the Club Supreme mike's style was really good
other This is a pretty cool store!I've recently found my artistic spirit through an old coworker, and I paid a visit to Utrecht one day to pickup some pastels and a sketchbook. They had all kinds of great stuff here, and the prices are very reasonable.The staff was pretty friendly, and helpful. I am not an artist, and I have no idea what I am doing with any of the mediums, but I didn't feel ashamed to ask questions.The location is a bit out of my way since I live in Scottsdale....and we found a store a little closer, Arizona Art Supply. BUT....this store is worth the drive and worth a visit.
other This place is as good as I'd heard.  We came here for a day-late birthday dinner for my middle daughter/Father's Day dinner for her husband.  She and his six-year old daughter ordered a Hawaiian style with pineapple and ham, he and I  got the Margherita Pizza with garlic, tomatoes, olive oil, fresh basil, mozzarella, and romano cheese.  Both were so delicious!  He also got some chicken wings which were tender and juicy and not spicy at all, dipped in either of two great sauces, ranch or marinara.  The pizza's were about $13 each for the larges.  I usually have no problem quitting after two slices but the  flavor squishing around in my mouth was so good I couldn't resist taking a third piece at this place. The decor was pretty and the service was great--the server checked back several times to see if we were doing okay or needed anything. I would definitely be a regular if I lived near here.  On a side note, next door is the Aloha Kitchen which we had eaten at about a week ago and was also very good!62010
other I've gone back a few times since my last review. Every single experience has been fantastic! The burgers are pretty good, BUT do yourself a favor and get the pork tenderloin OMFG!!! Sooooo freaken amazing! Also their onion rings are pretty much perfect! And the fried cheese curd...just get it! I was a little creeped out eating something called cheese curd, but holy deliciousness!
other I have been going to Nails 10other for a long time, and I love them! I had a manicure done there about a month ago, and it lasted for 8 days without chipping! Love Nails 101!!!!!!!!
other Do Not Eat Here if you think a bathroom in any way has anything to do with the cleanliness of the food preperation.  There was literally dried smeared feces on the toilet seat and the floor looked like it had never been washed.  Of course the restroom cleaning check-list was not initialed the entire day. Oh...I almost forgot there were no paper towels to dry my hands.  I told one of the employess and he says "I know dude".  It's rediculous that the bathroom looks like this when you have 10 employess standing around with their thumbs up their asses gossiping. Burger was over-priced.  Milkshake was ok.  Also no napkins anywhere in sight on the tables or at the bar area.  Apparently napkins are something you have to ask for?  Whoever owns this place needs to get a better manager at this facility, because he is loosing money with all of the one-time customers who will choose to go somehwere else next time.
other Very polite staff. Did not wait very long to be seen.
other I met some friends here for lunch, the menu is a weird mosh of Italian, Mexican and American food....it is almost like they can't figure out what kind of restaurant they want to be. I ordered the cheese enchiladas which was probably the wrong choice at a non-Mexican restaurant, but I just wasn't feeling anything else. The two people who were with me got their food, and I was still waiting, and waiting and waiting. Finally the waitress came over and asked if anyone had been here to talk to me...isn't that her job? She said that they gave my dish to someone else by accident, so they are making me a "fresh" plate. My enchiladas finally arrive, and look like they were just slopped on the plate. i take a bite and guess what? They were barely warm! You would think that a "fresh" plate would be served piping hot! I took a few bites, but by now I was over them and late for a meeting. A waitress that was different than ours brought over our check, which included my enchiladas. I told her what the problem was, but she didn't seem to speak English very well and said she would go ask someone. They did take them off the bill, but that really should have been done automatically since the other people at my table were done with their food before I even got mine! The decor is odd too, it is like they are trying to be a sports bar, but maybe aren't sure, evidenced by the 6 plasma TVs sitting in the corner still in their boxes! If I have a say in the matter....I won't be returning to Deemos.
3 It's three stars because I don't know how to rate it -- I didn't think it was very good at all when I went the other night during their grand opening, but maybe I just don't have a taste for it.  Service was prompt and polite.  The food?  Eh.  I had one of the house specials.  I didn't think it was very special.  I do think the waiter deserves bonus points for talking me into a half order rather than a full order.  The lemon-lime beverage was strong and sweet.
other My first experience with PCG was at a small, yet fantastic Yelp event.  I've been back twice and have been just as impressed.The first time was for brunch, and I recommend the griddled corn cakes.  No, I just don't recommend them, I insist you have them.  Even if you are allergic to corn, take the plunge and try these...unless you might die, then stay away as that might be bad PR for PCG.  Topped with smoked ham (that's what I had), chicken, or bacon and served with maple syrup, it was beyond good.  I could eat this dish every day of my life.  The black beans were okay, but I do think the breakfast potatoes are nothing special and could be improved upon.  I was a big fan of a $other mimosa, however!  Yep, you read that right...other bucks!Second visit for dinner, and I ordered the cedar planked salmon.  A generous piece of fish perfectly cooked and served with a delicious lemon aioli.  The accompanying roasted beets were not my thing, and the mashed potatoes were okay (maybe I'm picky about potatoes?)  I also tried a bit of my dining companion's beef tenderloin and it was butter-knife tender (that's what I cut it with).  Served with a stuffed potato and mushrooms, I believe, it will most likely be my next entree.  For dessert, we shared the Jack Daniel's croissant bread pudding.  We actually shared half, and I most generously took the other half to my husband who I left at home.  Although, I generally don't care for bread pudding, this is NOT your typical bread pudding and probably the best bread pudding you can imagine (other than that one recipe that uses a dozen Krispy Kreme doughnuts).Although PCG is a little bit of a drive for me (outside my usual 5-mile maximum radius), I will happily make that drive and return again.
other i've lived in the downtown area for like 85% of my life and have only ventured into the heritage square area a few times for Heritage Squarish events...usually it's a walk thru to the Arizona Science Center or to a parking lot. but i was here two weekends back to back for the NBA All-Star game tip off party and the Matsuri Festival a week later..and wow. this place can have some awesome things happening.the tip off party...75-80 bucks for a ticket..and full range to entertainment lots of food and drinks to sample...free of course. plus the museum and science center were open. live DJ music and access to Pizzeria Bianco and Rose and Crown. totally made my night. the Matsuri Festival was alot of fun, saw Jack play the drums, saw some kids dressed up as anime and manga characters. no free drinks that day. but still was alot of fun.Heritage Square gets my other stars for being a cool place to have things to do. plus the old houses and stuff rock.
3 What started as a food truck back in the 80s, has now evolved to two successful restaurants in the valley.  Using traditional recipes passed down through generations in Mexico - LT delivers the flavors that reminisce of street tacos in Mexico.  Using ingredients made from scratch, the marinades used for the various meats are outstanding!Being first timers there, the service staff was very friendly and suggested what menu items we should try - to experience the best they had to offer.  Our number one dish was the #other (about $6 or $7) - an assortment of three street tacos with chicken, pork, and beef.  All of them had unique and bold flavors - you could taste that the marinade had really absorbed into the meats.  They were served with cotija, pico, and cilantro - adding that truly authentic flavor to the tacos.  We also sampled the fish tacos and burritos.  Why this wonderful little place does not receive four stars or more?  Despite what Guy Fieri said, despite the wonderful flavor of these tacos, everything we ate was lukewarm or less.  From the refried beans to the rice, to the taco meat, and burrito.  It gave us the sense that despite being made from scratch, these wonderful ingredients had been sitting there for a while.  Albeit the flavor and texture of the meats was grand, it did not taste fresh.
other As the mom of  other kids (a 3 year old and a 8 month old) it seems to be very difficult to find a nice place to eat that is very comfortable and casual- and somewhere that people don't give you evil looks and comments  for bringing kids (Carraba's). We have been here a few times for lunch and the food has always been good. Not great, but pretty good and inexpensive. I will say though that their french fries are some of the best I've had! I would much rather come here than IHOP
3 I've been eating here for years off and on.  I used to live close by and went often.  The quality of the food started to go down and we stopped going.  Then they changed owners and it's ok to eat there again.  Flamingo Palace is just what you'd expect from a strip mall Chinese restaurant.  The food is so-so and the service is pretty good.  We really like the hot and sour soup and the Flamingo chicken.  I can say that through the many, many times that I've been to Flamingo I've never had an experience that made me NOT want to come back.
other Dumplings, Chicken fried steak with gravy. What more can you ask for. The satff was friendly and fast, Cant wait to try it again.
other Mylissa has given my daughter and me the *best* cuts! If you can, see her. She will take great care of you!
other Wednesday 7pm.  This place is your average over priced, lack of taste chain food restaurant and this place was no different. I have to say, I was super disappointed as I have always heard rave reviews, now I'm starting to question who I associate with and their taste in food.Service=slow.Food=just tastes like saltNoise=loud and they do a dance...like a lot.Go somewhere else and skip Joe's Crabs.
other probably my favorite restaurant :)
other Love massages and facials!I would highly recommend Enrique for a massage.  Great technique.  Great membership prices and great walk-in schedule for those last minute needs.
other I have only been going to LA Fitness for about 6 months. I live in Scottsdale and work in Phoenix, so I go to the 20th St & Camelback, Scottsdale and Oak and McCormick Ranch locations.  The Scottsdale locations are GREAT! They are clean, the staff is really nice and I see people cleaning the equipment when they are done.  What is it with the Camelback crowd?  The place really smells bad! It really needs a good cleaning. There has been this big spot on the carpet in front of the womens locker room since I started.  I was on the treadmill the other day really noticing how stinky it was and then the guy next to me finished up and just walked off, I swear he was sweating like a pig, left the equipment drenched! UGH!!!  Good God! I couldn't believe it, Can't the employees make these people clean after themselves?? The reviews are right about the staff just hanging around at the front desk.....they should be cleaning something, anything.  It really is a shame that this centrally located facility is a real stinky mess!!  I can't wait for the new one to open on 7th Avenue! Maybe then they may clean up their act.
other Divine,  the Carne Asada was so tasty,  flavorful and tender.  Everything we enjoyed tasted fresh and authentic. The guacamole was knock you socks off, traditional and limey, (I took my extra home and enjoyed the next day).  I liked what the previous reviewer who said also that the beans and rice are not an afterthought here, they are also amazingly well executed.  I am eager to get back an try the Chicken and Barbacoa as well as the roasted green chile cheese dip.   If your in the area of 44th Street and Thomas, forgo the big chain of Chipotle and show this lovey Phoenix gem some love, your taste buds will not be disappointed.
other This may be fiction.  I don't know for sure.  Here's what I pretty much think happened.The other night I was at a bar.  two days later I heard that it was Turf.  So I'm gonna go with it.  In body I was there, however my mind was suffering under an oppressive weight called alcohol that blurred pretty much every little thing that happened.For example: did I really find myself screaming piano man at the top of my lungs, to rapturous applause from the rest of the bar?  every time I tried to stop, I was goaded forth into the next verse?  (did the piano indeed sound like a carnival?)Was I really and truly told assuredly that I was gay?  Did I really have an argument for what felt like hours with a fair-eyed girl who has severe trust issues and one fucked up gaydar?  despite the wedding ring and total pudgy married-guy look did I still come across as gay?  (my wife tells me that it can only be the broadway rendition of a billy joel song.  I begrudgingly concede)Did I really hear someone who claimed to be a teacher misrepresent the very definition of a parallelogram?  Did she really say that a parallelogram could not have right angles?  Did I really scoff right at her and throw down the argument-crushing example of the square (QED biatch!)?  Evidently I did, because I do remember her backing me into a corner and beating my ass with a relentless barrage of haymakers, both rights and lefts, that left me bruised like a second-rate (albeit mathematically-savvy) prizefighter the next day.  Her-110 lbs at the very most, me twice that and then some on the most gravitationally-forgiving day, and I had no response but to cower in my own fucked-up rendition of the rope-a-dope.Her: "flex your stomach so I can hit you."Me: "Are you joking?  that's me, flexing."  (#fat)so I can tell you little to nothing about turf--I genuinely can't say for sure if that was the place we were at.  But since I asked right when I got there if I was allowed to yell, and the bartender said yes, yell to your heart's delight! I have to say four stars.  I would have said other but that looks really out of line with the rest of these reviews...
other Went here for our anniversary.  Pretty much what you would expect from an upper end steak house.  Yes, it's pricey.  Steaks were good and service was attentive.  A good place to celebrate.
other After a year in the Valley, one of my girlfriends took me to Side Bar.  I really like the atmosphere.  It was sleek yet cozy. The night we went in, it was hopping but not overly crowded.  A welcome sight considering much of my first year in the Valley was spent in crowded, pretentious Scottsdale hotspots. As I get older, I crave more intimate setting and SideBar fits the bill.  Also, I give five stars to any business who goes out of their way to help a good cause.  SideBar is just that kind of establishment.  If anyone is on Twitter, follow #buzzcation.  @SideBarphx has let #buzzcation folks hold a number of networking and fundraising happy hours.  It's a cool crew so come out and joing and I commend SideBar for always accomodating this crazy crew of tweeples. :)
3 This is a huge improvement over the last bar that occupied this spot. They obviously put a few bucks into the renovation and added pool tables. The rub is that when a band is playing here it totally dominates the conversation, and if the band sucks...  Please put in a smoking-friendly patio, right now customers have to stand by the parking lot sans drink! They have another less-noisy bar in the front, which I was pleased to discover was offering $other well drinks from 9-10pm for guys -  we took full advantage.
other Well, our initial plan was to go to Tuck Shop as I've been wanting to try it out. Unfortunately two ladies got there other sec before us and got the last table, the waiting area was packed with a group just hangin' and they had a 16 ppl reservation for later. There had sitting available right away at the bar but I'm pregnant and my back is killing me so bar stools were out of the question. They were very apologetic, which I thought was nice considering if wasn't their fault. I'm glad they're doing well. So I asked my husband if he wanted to try District and off we went. Actually, I made a reservation in case something happened and well, we ended up there.Nice and spacious, not crowded at all.  They were part of AZ restaurant week and we ordered from that menu.Shrimp sliders- I loved them! They should have a big version of it!Duck quesadilla- Very good as well, but I'm partial to anything with goat cheese.We both got the country chicken steak and it was really good. Mine came other med, other small pieces instead of a big one. The med piece was a bit dry and the breading was slightly burnt. The smaller one was perfect, juicy and crispy. The breading flavor was really good, slightly  spicy. The biscuits were awesome!! More of a cake-bread texture, light and fluffy and kind of sweet. Green beans were tasty as well.Strawberry shortcake whoopie pies with lime basil sorbet ( I think it was a sorbet)- It was good, but not something I'll order again. The pie filling was too sweet, even the tartness of the sorbet couldn't help it.Service was prompt, no hovering or having to wait for too long and our food came at a perfect pace.Great dining experience and it made me forget about Tuck Shop. I still want to try it though.
other This place has not gotten any better over the past 10 years. The service is still bad and they are always running out of food and the food isn't that great either.  Will have to say that I will not be going back to this location or the one off of Glendale and 19th ave.
other This location was a Groupon find... Won't be back. The girl behind the counter was nice but even though I had the groupon right in front of me, she had to read it several times and I had to explain to her what I was supposed to be getting with it. The red light therapy is a nice idea... But the room the bed was in was lacking. They should hire an exterminator, not leave sticky bug traps down with dead bugs all over the floor where people generally have bare feet... Yuck!!
other Absolutely incredible. It appears the young lad who works here seems to be the go-to front-desk man everyday for this shop. He was very helpful and told me exactly what my shoes needed and didn't suggest pricier repair options that my shoes really weren't in need of! I brought in two pairs of dress shoes; one of which I had the heels replaced ($22, free shining included) and another just for shining ($8) and they made them look near-brand new again! I will certainly be bringing all of my shoes in for repairs/cleaning within the near future to this fantastic little shop!Keep singing,-Jerron
other Inexpensive, tasty, fast. The gentle peanut dressing on the pre-meal salad gets you started on a simple, no-frills meal with exactly one option from all of the classic dishes you expect at a Thai restaurant in America: massaman, red, green, yellow, or panang curry; pad thai or chowmein; meat or vegetable rice plates. There's nothing extravagant in spices or food choices, but you can order the spiciness level to you liking.
other After vine expressions closed many of us have tried this place.  I like new things and love different types of cuisine but this place doesn't hit the spot.  It's nice to go somewhere and get a wine list by the glass where you can choose a wine you enjoy but of course you want to know the freakin vineyard.  Not here.  By the glass, the list just has varietals - shiraz, cab, etc.  They change their list a lot but so do many places.  The food - below average.  Tried the stew that they said was great and famous.  Bland.  The sliders were like eating a salt lick, too salty.  The servers are nice but they tend to ramble on and give you a 1other minute dissertation on the menu and why you shouldn't look at the last page because it's not available yet but they want you to know it's there.  Finally, a few people mentioned the sucky chairs.  Boy, they weren't kidding.  They have many stools at tables with no back.  Customers should be comfortable, this is not.  The seats with backs have as much padding as a 2X4.  Bottomline, uncomfortable.You want better options, here you go.  The living room in Chandler, my wine cellar in Ahwatukee, postino in Arcadia, 5th and wine in Old Towne, kazimierz in Old Towne, and terroir wine pub in N Scottsdale.  Been to all of them and all significantly better.    Tons more on Yelp.Postino is supposedly opening where grainbelt used to be across from Joe's BBQ in downtown Gilbert so when that's there a local joint should be available.
other I really like Maizie's, but unfortunately will not get to go as often anymore. I hate to report that after our last visit, my husband received a bad bout of food poisoning. It was, in fact, his first time puking in approximately 10 years. It was not pleasant for him and it was not pleasant for me. For that reason, I guess I'm going to have to drop one star from my previous review. The thing is, I really love Maizie's. I love their menu and I love their atmosphere. Unfortunately, the portobello sandwich...or maybe it was the cottage cheese...just doesn't love my husband and that means I don't get to visit quite as often.  :(
other Where to begin?This is my favorite Mexican food establishment ever. I've been frequenting Carolina's for years and never once have I been disappointed. Some might compare it to Filiberto's or any of those [insert surname here]berto's but this is on a whole different level.Atmosphere-wise it's one step above a sketchy hole-in-the-wall but the food makes up for everything the appearance of the place lacks. I don't know their secret but their beans, the tortillas, the salsa... it's all to die for. And IT'S. SO. CHEAP. Like, seriously, I'd dish out more money for this food but the fact that it really is that cheap is the icing on the cake. It's almost always busy but it's always worth the wait. Always.If you haven't gone... you're missing out.
other My friend took me for a birthday lunch.  John our waiter was very helpful and had perfect timing.  We shared the Stetson Chopped Salad and Fillet on Toast with leeks and homemade potato chips with blue cheese.  The kitchen plate/split our fillet, always a plus.  The salad with salmon, chicken is offered, was tossed tableside.  CC always has it's own twist on offerings.   The bread pudding and banana icecream were decadent.   Wish I lived closer.
other I've been to this location a few times, but this was by far the best experience I've had. It was two Sundays ago, myself and seven friends wanted to watch the early games and get some food and drinks. My friend called ahead and made a reservation. When we got there, we had a big table reserved right in front of all the TVs. Our waitress was very attentive, friendly and quick. They had a bunch of beer bucket deals that we all took advantage of and had a great time watching all the games, enjoying some beverages and eating some food. Their breakfast burrito with chorizo was fantastic and it'll keep me coming back. See ya next Sunday, Majerle's!
other Entering the store is visually overwhelming. There were so many things take in, I thought I'd found my new grocery store. I wandered for a good 40 mins checking everything out.... After the ether wore I began to realize something. While the selection was wide, it look OLD. I raced to the fresh fish and noticed that even packed in ice their little fish eyeballs where cloudy and sunken into the sockets. I looked at the frozen section and found some fish that had a sell by date of 02/2010. There was other fish that was packed by the store  with no packed on or sell by dates. There was canned and boxed food past their expiration date. I checked out this place on the Maricopa County health department and they had their fare share of customer complaint driven inspections.
other Though a couple of hiccups could've ruined the night, Roaring Fork took great care of my boyfriend and me and the food was delicious to boot (ha, boot. Get it? cuz it's western? Never mind).We were surprised at how busy they were on a Tuesday night, but we were able to snag a table on their beautiful covered patio. The atmosphere was nice, and i was surprised at the range of patrons (a family of other with 3 fairly young children at one table, and a 10-top of blue hairs right next to us). Our server Charlie was very nice and helpful when it came to selections (from wine to food). We are trying out places in prep for a family visit, so we want to make sure we get a good sapling of the menu.We ordered a bottle of sauv blanc, and though the wine was delicious, it took about the half the meal for Charlie to bring out the marble chiller. Thankfully the wine started out pretty cold, so no harm no foul. I orderd a bowl of tortilla soup (one of my faves) and I was impressed witht he presentation and taste. The bring the bowl with the chicken and tortilla strips out then pour the broth from a pot right at your table. Helps keep the tortilla strips crisp and was a great presentation. The soup was delicious, though a little creamier than i normally like my tortilla soup. We also ordered the seared ahi with guac and THAT was amazing. The pepitas crackers were delicious and interesting and the ahi was perfect. Great app for sure. Plus, the bread and butter were super delicious too. Garlic biscuits, mini corn bread and pepper butter? so good!For entrees the boyfriend ordered the bacon wrapped pork loin over grits and I ordered the signature Dr. Pepper BBQ Baby Back Ribs. We subbed fries for asparagus and green beans and ordered an extra side of their green chile mac and cheese. I know, a lot of food, but we planned on taking most of it home. Here's where it got interesting. Or should I say, boring. So far everything (except the chiller) had been delivered timely and was tasty. But when we realized we'd been waiting 30 mintues or so for our entrees to come (after they'd taken away our apps), it started to get a little annoying. After about 40-4other mintues, the manager came over and leet us know our tray of food had been dropped and had to be re-made. No problem! I understand accidents happen. But i think it would've done a lot to smooth us over if they'd told us right away the spill had happened rather than waiting until we were about eat the burger off the table next to us. RF did recognize the inconvenience though and completely took care of us when the bill came. So props to them for that, and we didn't even complain or ask for any special treatment.When the food finally arrived, the ribs were OUTSTANDING. the sauce was perfect, not to sweet, not to flat. And the meat was literally falling off the bone. The veggies were all good, but the really show-stopper was the mac and cheese. The crumble top was delicious and the cheese was melted and runny but not stringy or clumpy. Spicy from the green chiles but perfectly reasonable. I want another kettle of them right now. So good. The boyfriends dinner was also good, but i think my ribs and the mac and cheese were really the best part.We boxed everything up and ordered the huckleberry bread pudding to go. I was disappointed they no longer do the pineapple upside down cake, which so many yelpers have recommended, but I loved the bread pudding as a substitute. the buttery sauce didn't reheat very well at home, but it was still very very good and the ice cream was a perfect complement. I would totally order it again. Like a muffin fresh from the oven, still a little gooey.Overall, i loved the food and the staff was really apologetic bout the "incident". The atmosphere is great and i would definitely come back. Next time, the burger!
3 My boyfriend and I were in Arizona on vacation for a wedding. The food was better than the average deli and they give you a free cookie with your order too. It is a shame they don't have these in malls near me. Although I read on their website that they have one at the Galleria which would have been nice when I lived in Davis, CA for college. Shopping really works up an appetite and this satisfied it well. and light enough not to ruin a dinner as we had a wedding to attend later that evening.
other NO.  Don't go. Don't do it.  This was my first visit and it was on a whim because we drive by it often.  One other reviewer here made a wise statement - go the grocery store and buy frozen fish.  I promise it will be better than this.
other Been here twice. First time to fix a broken window regulator and the second time to get a checkup. All the techs have been extremely honest and I've never felt taken advantage of. I spent over a grand on updates to my car there and I could've spent more but again, they're honest and didn't pressure me to do everything that they said. It's family owned & run (they're originally from the bay area so of course I've got a soft spot!) If you have car problems, need a check up, or need a second opinion, they won't steer you wrong (pun intended).
other Okay, this place has received a ton of slack from prior reviews. I am not a huge fan of the food nor the 1950's style decor, but the people are nice and I have been more than satisfied with the spinach queso dip. I actually do get a craving for it which draws me every few months to that bright turquoise and black decor. The lunch menu is very reasonable and the lunch portion of the pollo magnifico was good! What this place lacks in food, is made up in quick, fairly friendly service, and an area that is convenient to downtown Scottsdale and the Giants Spring training stadium. I like the breezy patio area but the big black birds that stalk the fallen corn chips under your chair are a bit frightening. But after a game this March, I am actually looking forward to spinach dip and margarita at Julio G's.
other This place is a bit scary.  (And since it is a Chinese restaurant, that means a little more than scary).  It's dark, (even though its been remodeled at least once since it has changed owners a few times).  It serves mostly Cantonese based cuisine although most of the waitstaff tend to speak Mandarin.  I'm actually Chinese and notice these things.  There is some live seafood.  I usually go here for lunch when we have a crowd.  It is inexpesive and fairly quick to get in and out.  A bit heavier on the salt and sauces than I would like though.  I tend to go to my old standbys Great Wall or my newer loves Nee House or South China knowadays.
other I'm generally very fond of Rubio's, but this location just isn't up to snuff. The food is good, but somehow not quite as good as other locations (it doesn't seem as fresh). The restaurant isn't as clean as it should be, the tables are always kind of sticky, and the restroom... well, it smells like swamp gas (and not just once). Also some of the seats are town and have been "repaired" with large amounts of tape (the tape is worn and sticky and if you're a dude wearing shorts, it will pull the hair right off your leg!) ...To be fair, I guess it could pull the hair off a non-dude's leg too, but let's just not go there.
other This review pertains to carnitas, and as such should not be taken as a suggestion for ordering any of the following: fish tacos, rice, beans, horchata. That's about it! Yum!
other Came in for my birthday burger, and decided on the garden-burger.  I hadn't tried it before, but I'll be trying it again, many more times.  I may even go vegetarian now that this baby is in my dietetic arsenal.  Love it!
other Waited for Mad Men characters to walk in! Seriously? Went here last night for the first time, ordered 3lb stuffed lobster, stuffed with crab & scallops, lobster was tougher than nails, scallops were tasteless, crab was ok, charged an additional $1other for this stuffing but neglected to tell us until after I questioned the bill. Hubby had a 3 lb. not stuff lobster, but were tough, questioned it and was told "they are sometimes tough", Server was great! They have absolutely no idea how to make a dirty martini! The ONLY good I can say is that the bread was great. Not going back here, seemed to me that the crowd in the bar was well over 70 and the crowd in the restaurant was mixed! Reservations? Not needed at all, the place was empty.
other Old school style butcher shop that has great service and a great selection.  You will pay more, but you can sign up for their emails and get the monthly and weekend specials.  Often there are coupons for BOGO or a few bucks off your purchase.  They also have a good selection of beer and wine, side dishes, and some supplies for home BBQ and smoking.  After reading the other reviews, I know my hubby and I need to try the jerky.  We always enjoy shopping at Von Hanson's.
3 I have only had their pizza once, to go. It was ok but nothing to write home about.;... would try again but will be more skepitcal....
3 Sauce has grown on me... particularly this location since this is the one I frequently end up at for a quick lunch or casual dinner spot near home.I typically order chopped salads at lunch.  The chopped turkey & feta salad is what I had today.  I had them add asparagus, which was a great call if I may say so myself!  The large salad and fresh roll is the perfect lunch... fresh, filling, healthy enough, and pretty inexpensive when it comes to designer salads around town.  I also like the spinach, pancetta & goat cheese and the veggie & aged parmesan salads.  My husband eats at Sauce often as well... he goes for a salad or sandwich.  Last time we were there together, he had the salami, turkey, prosciutto & mozzarella panini.  I had a bite and was pleasantly surprised! It had a nice balance of thin sliced meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and tangy red wine vinegar in between two perfectly grilled pieces of bread.  The thin crust pizzas are pretty decent also.  Depending on your appetite, sharing a pizza and a salad with your companion can work out to be a satisfactory meal... What I like about Sauce the most? Fast, friendly, and efficient service in a clean and casual environment.  The moderate pricing is also a big plus in my book... especially in this economy.
other Wow. I'm not even going to wait until I'm done before leaving a review. I just placed my order, 30 minutes after sitting down.11:3other - Sit at a table for 8 an order drinks. So far so good.11:39 - Things were going alright when we had a table of 8, but when a few more people showed up to attempt to give Floridino's some money in return for a quick lunch, all hell broke loose.11:4other - There was a room next to us with a bunch of empty tables. "You can't sit in there. We don't have a server in there." Screw it, we picked up our drinks and moved in. If they can serve us at that table, they can serve us one table over in this other room.11:4other - We asked to see the manager.11:50 - "We can get you drinks in here, but not food. We have to wait for a table to open up out there. Then we can serve you."11:5other - Someone who looks like a manager peeks into the room and leaves. We still haven't spoken to a manager...11:5other - "We don't want to overwhelm the kitchen." (Hmm.. If you didn't want to "overwhelm" the kitchen, maybe you should have taken my order 20+ minutes ago...)12:0other - They're taking our food orders in the Forbidden Room. I guess they're not as allergic to accepting our money as they led us to believe.12:3other - Just received my food in the Forbidden Room. Pretty much exactly an hour after I got here.You suck, Floridino's.
other NOTE:  I only had take-out, and it was brought to me by my boss.  She rules!She got me a hummus/grilled/marinated chicken combo.  It has 3 different hummus...es...es (HA!): roasted red pepper, jalapeno and plain ole' hummus.  They are sectioned off in the big plastic container, which rules for my OCD, as I don't like my food touching.  In the center is a PILE (a total monton!) of grilled chicken.  It's got some sort or spicy rub on it, but not too much kick.  It had been marinated, too.  And tender....I think this is the most tender chicken I have ever had.  It made my own tender spots as juicy as the chicken was!I'm not big on pita, so instead she got me a side of cukes.  This thing weighs a ton and I've been eating it for other hours.  I have made a mess in my "Make me Yelp" boyshorts.
other Go
other Okay... just let me say, these guys are the best! My family and I stayed in Scottsdale for other weeks this past summer and we frequented Baskin Robbins almost every single night. No kidding. And, yes, my butt thanks me not for such goings on. But at any rate, we have never met such a friendly ice cream staff. I am a PITA when it comes to ordering my ice cream -- I like jamoca ice cream with almonds mixed in, then I like my fudge on the side and I like extra fudge. This sort of ice cream order has raised a few brows, and furrowed some in the past, but not here, not these guys! And the couple of times, my rice-high (from the sushi place next door) son dropped his cone on the floor, they were so kind and understanding about it, they just scooped up the mess while they joked around with my little one about all the ice cream they've had to wipe off the floor in the past with other customers, and made him a fresh new cone, adding extra sprinkles, for good measure. Viola! No more tears and only big smiles from that moment on. They really are the best! I can't wait to visit them again! :)
other As a mom of two, Jason's Deli is awesome. The ingredients are fresh and healthy, and the kid's meals are huge and priced right. For my young kids (other and 2), one meal is enough for them to share. For bigger kids, it seems they could be eating off the kid's meal longer than at some places. Add speedy delivery of food and free self-serve ice cream at the end, and this is one happy mom!
other I love Coldstone like no other but this place has really bad mixers.  I came in on a late afternoon weekday, no other customers to be served.  Placed my order and figured she would give it a good solid mix.  All she did was poke my brownie into my ice cream a few times, sprinkle some nuts, and called it quits.  It was sad that I had to eat all of my brownie at the beginning because it ended up all on top!
3 I read quite a few reviews on Yelp prior to checking this place out with a group of 10 or so.  We arrived and the table wasn't ready just yet - we ordered a variety of cocktails, menu driven cocktails, beer and wine. I had an 8th Street Ale - always a good choice.  I had to ask for a cold glass to put it in and when I was served the 2nd one, they didn't include it. I had to ask again.The food:  Pretty good, actually. However, its totally overpriced and the portions are pretty small. So it makes the hurt on the wallet that much more severe.  Our waitress was cool, she put up with a lot of conversations in our group, sometimes being loud and not paying attention.I would go back again, but most likely for lunch. Hopefully you would get the same size meal for a few bucks less.  By the way, I had the pasta with rib eye in it (I forget the name) and my wife had the Carbonara.  They were both good!
other This place is such a delightful treat. Not only is the Barrio Cafe in what some Phoenicians would called the actual barrio, but it's non-descript on the outside and purely magical within. Not terribly difficult you keep your eyes peeled, Barrio Cafe is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Arizona and is a must try for any Phoenix local. You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu, although their seafood offerings are my least favorites. I am in love with their conchita pibil, which is their slow-roasted pork and they have the best made-at-the-table guacamole in all of Phoenix. Their food is the kind of special occasion dinner that you and all your guests will be savoring every morsel, but save room for one of their delectable desserts! I'm a fan of their flan, in particular. Service is spot on and it's usually pretty packed, so come as early as you can or face a semi-long wait at the bar. Don't worry though, they've got great margaritas. This is the place Tempe's Mucho Gusto wished it could be some day. But it probably won't.
other I love this place! I have been coming here for ages.My favorites: Elsa's Chicken sandwich, any of their burgers, dragon chicken wings, china's little chicken sandwich, and the hot pepper chicken sandwich. The atmosphere is always fun and the art they display is very abstract but totally cool!
other I have been coming to this place for atleast other years. This is a favorite of my friend's whole family. This place is so very consistent. They always have the same good things. If you're looking for buffet variety this is not the place. Everyone is so very nice. This place has been open for 30 years for good reason. I have never ordered from their menu because their buffet is so good. Go and try not to get hooked. Enjoy!
3 Could have been other stars... I went here for the first time last Friday. It was busy, but they don't have that many tables and there were at least other waitresses on that I could see. Our services was sooooooo slllllllow. Like painfully slow. We waited a long time for refills, a long time for our food, a long time for the check to come. It was really annoying. Our waitress was nice, but slow. Onto the food! We got an order of wings and an order of the fried zucchini. The zucchini was really good but holy hell she should have warned us that it had JUST came out of the fryer that may have been heated by lava. I popped one of those bad boys in my mouth and immediately felt the skin on the roof of my mouth start to come off. Once the burning subsided I was good to go. I hear the wings were tasty, They were really big (I just don't eat wings) I ordered the fish and chips. So yummy! Our friend got the grilled chicken sandwich with a side of grilled asparagus. LOVE that they offer grilled veggies as a side! I snuck a couple asparagus and they were tasty. Hubs got the ribs, it was a huge pile of meat on a plate. He loved it! I will for sure go back, the food was really great, I will just know not to expect quick service.
other After hearing for years that this is Theeee Best Breakfast in town I finally checked it out.  Now I've been twice, and I just don't get it.  I just found NOTHING special about this place at all.  It's a cute breakfast dinner and the pancakes and waffles are ... well, pancakes and waffles.Both times I've been we had to wait to be seated, and both times I didn't feel it was worth it.In my opinion Palette, Over Easy and Matt's Big Breakfast are so much better.  Of course your mileage may vary.
other Loved the spinach salad.  I'll have to find out what kind of dressing that was in it.  Yumm  The beer selection is the first thing that I would come back for.  We ordered the Gourmet White pizza which has:Olive Oil and Garlic base pizza with Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Provolone, Mozzarella, Feta, Roma Tomatoes and Onions.Yummy. Especially the crust, which is a wheat crust that compliments the pizza very well.  Nothing left on my plate!  Hope to try the meatier, yes, I made up that word, pizzas next time!
other I've been to corporate events, concerts and Spring Training games here, and I've been consistently surprised at how well they do what they do.  First the field.  At Spring training games you are so close you feel like you're watching a little league game.  The grass is go green it almost looks fake (it's not).  And the backdrop of office and apartment buildings is decidedly suburban.  I finally get the big draw.  Next - the vendors. Taco in a bag (must experience to believe).  Strawberries and banana dipped in chocolate on a stick.  Great pizza.  Amazing choices of beer.  Oh, if only they had a selection of soda the way they had a selection of beer.  Parking is plentiful and the grounds are always kept neat.  Folks who work there have all been helpful and friendly.  It may feel like it's forever away from our Phoenix core, but it's not to far for an experience that BOB or Chase Field could never provide.
other I was so happy to see another station in the neighborhood.  I went in to fill up as I usually do at any station unaware that I was paying TEN CENTS MORE PER GALLON (than Circle K)  because I wasn't paying cash or using a Shell credit card.  Yes, there are signs on the pump but, really, who would think to look for such a requirement?  I've been buying gas for over 40'years and have never seen such a non-cash penalty.  I, and my children, their spouses and our friends will not be getting gas there ever again.  How disappointing and dishonest.
other I'm on a Outback kick.  I can't help it.  We ended up here one evening by chance and I love their steak and loaded mashed potato.  The service is good, the food is good, it's not too crowded.  Like I say, I'm on a kick.
other Disclaimer, I was raised in New Orleans, and miss good Poor Boys, Crawfish, Boiled shrimp, Jambalaya  etc.... yadda yadda yadda, hear me whine... I try to be lenient when I go somplace because it's unreasonable to expect to find the food here that I would at the Magazine St. Po Boy shop. I was also raised on popeyes, every once in awhile I would hop off the Streetcar on the way to school and get a Chicken Biscuit w/cheese. And frequrntly I would get a other piece spicy, and even though it was a chain, it was a local chain with massive quality control. (and yes, odds are those years are most likely why over the past 3 years I've lost 250 pounds!.... Moderation kids!)Over the years, the chain was sold off, the original owner died, and Popeye's became more hit and miss, especially the further you got away from the south.Heck, you get your hopes up just to see a Popeye's!usually the stand alone's are better, and the ones attached to Gas stations are hideous.  I've tried a few in the Phoenix area, And have been generally unimpressed. Not horrible, but just... a very thin flavorless crust.So it was with trepedation that I went into this location, a drive through, attatched to a gas station.I went for a box of chichen w/biscuits. and I can say it was the best I've had in the city so far.The man at the window was friendly, the chicken was fresh, good, solid breading. With enough heat to give a nice depth of flavor, cutting a bit deeper than other chains would dare... which is what Popyes is all about. (I'm used to some blazing hot chicken... not stupid mind you, just HOT.. this is not that, but a good flavor. With good moist flesh, and thick crunchy skin. And the meal made the travel home well.One downside? I'm just not a fan of these biscuits, they werent old... but they were dry... and lack the lush, buttery flavor and texture that I love. These were more dense and hockypuckish than I prefer.If your craving some Popeye's chicken... well, lets put it this way,,, I'll be driving 20 minutes out of my way to go here.This is my first time... so Your Milage May Vary.. Sidenote, I'n no Church's Chicken fan, but I went to the one on Arizona Avenue... and I've got to say, thats some fine spicy chicken! And cheap! And a big box of fried okra makes The Bride very pleased indeed!
3 Lovely shop, great cupcake selection, friendly service.  But the real question is...how do the cupcakes taste???  Pretty good.  I tried (4) flavors and they ranged from OK to YUMMMMMM!  Vanilla with chocolate buttercream was ok, the Coconut was good (a bit dry, but decent flavor), the Carrot was very good, and the Mocha was YUMMMMMM!   They were all super sweet though.  My husband and I both had a quarter of each flavor and that was more than enough.  From a flavor variety and taste perspective, Sprinkles is a 3.other - 4.  However, I really can't justify spending $14.00 for (4) cupcakes.  They are expensive so they can pay their overhead and lease costs, not because of exotic ingredients or special decorating skills.  Don't get me wrong, I'm sure they use good ingredients, but the wrappers are plain, there's no special piping or fondant work, and the flavors are standard. They are just plain good cupcakes...not fantastic, but good.  Certainly not worth $3.50 a cupcake.  I do a ton of baking and I get special order requests from friends and neighbors all the time.  I always do nice decorating and use premium ingredients and the most I charge is $2.00 a cupcake...and that's only if I use fondant.
3 While in Phoenix for about 36 hours, I lunched at Hooters twice. It was easily located across from my hotel and it was a weekend, which meant I could catch both the collegiate and professional football games as well as playoff baseball. I take Hooters for what it is, pretty decent fried food, a restaurant that caters to men, and always has a game on. This in mind, I didn't anticipate anything other then a beer and something to eat.I sat at the bar both times and the bartender, Brittany was extremely friendly and made a point to learn (while IDing) and remember everyone's name-- which I thought was a nice touch. She was always willing to change channels to make sure everyone's game was being aired which was appreciated as well. They have a good football special-- 10 boneless wings with all you can eat fries for $5.99 during any football game.  The $3.50 25oz Shock Top beers were a deal as well. It was odd for me to see a kid's birthday party in the restaurant on Sunday, but to each their own.
3 This bar is ok to hang out at. I think its sort of frumpy. The drinks are fine, I've never eaten there.  They have PBR there. Lots of local people mostly regulars. Anyone can go there an fit in there.  I have been a few times but it's not a place I spend a lot of time.
other I love Jimmy Johns!
other I hated this place. It looks like a nice first date restaurant but the food and price are so not worth it. The hot tofu soup was pitiful and my fiance ordered the bbq and a sushi which were both too expensive for their own good and the sushi tasted like something was old....Never again! Chodang, here I come!
other This place is old school.  i.e. you don't come here for the service, or the ambiance (especially since it's in a scary part of town).  You come for the food.  Come with a group of friends, whether for dim sum or a late night dinner.  You need a group of people, I hate coming here when its just mean and three others.  I like to taste and sample lots of goodies.  They have great live seafood (a must in my book) where you can walk by and see what looks good that day.  Be brave and check it out!
other I LOVE this place. The marijuana theme isn't kid-friendly though, so DONT bring your kids. Just bring it home to them.Their subs are really tasty, the theme (for adults) is hilarious, the people are friendly, and are reasonably priced.Also, the potato salad is fantastic!
other Awesome if you like ramen...even awesomer if you like boba tea!!!
3 Ok..seriously just ok. Green salsa was horribly sweet and gel like. It had no taste of tomatillo in it. The tacos were stuffed to the gills but average. The chimis tasted reheated in the microwave and oddly like sopapillas. Over all ok food but a bit pricy for ok food.
other If you can look past the giant Meth billboard right outside and the general uncleanliness of the entire establishment, it's pretty wonderful... especially if your intentions involve eating a whole lobster, like myself.Gourmet House of Hong Kong has the cheapest whole lobster dishes I've ever found, anywhere. I don't mean a measly, mid-western, tourist trap restaurant kind of lobster, I mean a damn good, meaty, savory, juicy morsel of deliciousness.It's served a number of ways, but I usually go for the black bean sauce style. Then, I eat like nobody's watching, vow to never let my boyfriend see me like this, and usually end up getting sauce on my face, clothing, table, neighbors, etc. Go messy, or go home.
other Great neighborhood sports bar.  They've got something like 3other HD TV's  all arranged so you can get a good view no matter where you sit.  The staff is friendly, drinks are inexpensive (like $10.00 for other beer and other vodka/soda), and their food is tasty.  They have a large comfy outdoor seating area if you want to catch some fresh air.My only complaint about this place is on the weekends they usually have a cover band... not that the band is terrible or anything (i think they switch it up so it's  not always the same band anyway), but they're loud and if you're there to watch a game, forget about hearing anything relating to the game, including the people you are with.  I can see how this could go either way with people since it does add kinda a rockin' environment, which is nice, depending on your mood.Oh and they have those satellite speaker things so you have this box at your table and you can tune the sound to whichever game you're interested in listening to, not that it matters when the band is playing, but every other time it's cool.
other I totally agree with L.C.'s review.  Going to XCP made college seem like a breeze.  Yes, there were the typical high school dramatics, but I feel like the teachers were able to take a harder line on discipline, since they weren't in fear of getting in hot water with the public school district.  I had an overall great experience here, and I love meeting people all over the country that have gone to Xavier.  My last flight home, the person in the seat next to me went there, and we had tons of people/things to chat about.  It's fun to see where everyone has ended up, and it is fun to get together with fellow alums for drinks here in Chicago, and when I am back home in AZ.  I think it is so sad that the girls don't get to do freshman swimming, sophomore dances, or go to dockers anymore - those were some defining moments of my XCP career.  I don't know much about other private schools cropping up in the growing valley, but if I had kids, they would be headed to Xavier and Brophy!
3 I've decided to up the rating of this place to 3 stars because I went back for a second try. (it was close to work)  This time the burger actually had juices left.  They still wont cook it less then well done which puts me off but at least it had flavor this time.I still dont recommend this place when you can spend a bit more and get a real burger at FEZ, Zinburger or Delux.
other Good, Cheap, Chinese and Food - add Buffett and it is explains why Outlook has recurring event function. I would be tempted to live off the $3.50 lunch specials, but I would burn up my savings with time and gas.Combos come with rice, egg roll, crab puff and chicken wing.A la Carte comes with soup, rice, and fortune cookie (Take out = no soup)Menu does not have some standards, i.e., almond chicken - but cashew is certainly acceptable.Sauce abundant but thin, flavors are not bold, and "spicy" is not. However, value for $ is substantial and got plenty of spicy with addition of hot oil.They are tucked into a strip mall with little to no visibility. My sister has lived less than a mile from there for years and did not know it was there. I would not have found this place without Yelp -Thank You.
other My wife and I were downtown with some friends, and decided to check this place out. I ordered a pasta lunch, and chose Penne Alla Campagna and another penne with tomatoes and Mozzarella. Meh, it was just okay. The food was just okay, kind of bland and a bit overpriced. I did snag a small slice of pepperoni pizza from one of the kids at our table that was actually the best part of my meal. Would I go back, nope no sir
other Basicly i would let anyone know i like it, never heard a wiper of a bad experience here.  Def a fan, i work very close by and if i really need they would deliver, yeah their that nice.  How can i put it Ladybug House of Sandwiches or Sandwich shop for short what a great place in phoenix to take care of the lunch fill with out going to Subway, (not saying i don't go there).  When I need a real sandwich I stop in here.  They are a lunch spot so they close early and will have specail summer time hours.  Why ladybug house of sandwiches well, great meats choice of differnt breads and its like what I love the ladybug theme.  and just what you think of ladybugs their nice not pests, pretty and would make a cool friend.  Small note, i put my business card in their bowl once and actually won!  I got half off for the whole office, thanks ladybug ladies your the best.  Once again Kevin, lets you know whats real, kind of like meMcDowell right accross from the Banner Hospital  right smack in the middle of the whole campus of medical buildings and offices.
other The 3 employees were so busy talking to each other they couldn't remember what we ordered, kept having to ask, and still didn't get it right.  In the midst of the three employees continuing in their personal chaos, my husband finally said, "ok, time out! I'm the customer.  Make our sandwiches and then take care of your issues.". They stopped for a split second, all three looked at us, then they actually IGNORED us, finished their conversation, then finished our sandwiches.  We were the only ones in there and we really were shocked!  Good thing I like avacado, because it ended up on my sandwich & I didn't order it, and after telling the girl, she said, "I thought you said...". Still had the order wrong!  Whew!
other I don't think my husband will let me rate it anything less than other stars... Parking for us was okay since we did not park in the lot, we parked at neighboring house for other bucks.  Grabbed some towels from the hotel and staked out our claim on the lawn... People were very friendly.  My hubby met some folks from Dixon, IL the day before and they came by to say Hi... and of course, watching the Cubbies - can't beat that!!!
other Honestly I go here rarely.  My recent visit was to watch my godson while his parents were doing family picture photo shoot in the Chinese gardens and pond areas.  You can walk the whole cultural center and its gardens in 10 minutes, so there isn't alot of sightseeing here.  But to get a little glimpse of some replica gardens and seating structures from China, where else to go?  So other stars for the somewhat idyllic gardens in back behind the shopping plaza, cuz there isn't any other place in the valley like it.
other 2nd time messing up our carry out order. Boneless wings have bones and no carrots or celery again!!  Hamburger with only tomato, cheese, and BBQ sauce had onions and lettuce, when we specifically said no lettuce or onion. Allergic to onions and don't like shredded lettuce. Thanks to Tiler for messing up our order again. Will not be back.
other Yum!  even though it is incredibly heavy and bad for you- YUM.  we got the beef and hominy stew with fry bread and the ultimate taco.  let's start with the stew- though it was just beef and hominy, the broth was so tasty and delicious.  didn't even need the fry bread on the side.  the ultimate taco was pretty awesome- we got the red beef chili and then it had refried beans, cheese, sour cream, and lettuce.  it definitely wasn't gourmet but it was so delicious and so cheap!  gluttonous, but worth it.  we wanted to get a dessert fry bread, but we were just way too full to even go there.
3 Came in with high expectations.Wonderful surroundings, I love the New York concept here. And the area attracts a higher quality of person, which appeals to me.Place was packed on a Friday night of course , drinks were good, lots of attractive people, and a FABULOUS band playing.However, the energy/vibe in the room didn't match the band's energy. There were many 40+ something men going after early to mid 20s girls/women. That resonated throughout the place. I actually walked around the entire venue to see if I "felt" differently, but nope it was all over. Not only that but people were indifferent about dancing in groups with strangers. I was there with my wife and she doesn't really dance so I tried to casually get into a group of 3 or other and there was no welcoming. I was disappointed.So we left after maybe 30-4other minutes, probably never to return, unless people start raving about the venue, which will mean either the people changed or new people have discovered it.
other Great spa... If you don't mind spending a few bucks, this is the place for you. Neat water fall room, roof top pool, and eucalyptus room! I've had multiple massages here & they were exceptional. Outstanding customer service too.
other My wife and I moved from Seattle in November of 2006. We thought we would find great, modern Mexican food all around the Valley. Fortunately we found it, but only at Barrio Cafe (so far). Barrio Cafe is a sure hit with anyone who loves Mexican food without a half plate of gray, canned refried beans. Their menu is excellent, thought put into the dishes inspired and the ingredients are fresh. It's well worth the hour wait.
other It is almost impossible to find a great sandwich shop that actually has good grinders and sandwiches.  Well my search is over.  I stumbled across this little shop and felt right at home in New England.  Being from Connecticut, I was so excited to see all the great food on the menu.  I had the Vermonter and it was bliss at every bite.  The owners are extremely friendly and you can tell that they want you to be very happy with their food and service.  Great food and great service, you will not be dissapointed....
3 Overall good place. Pizza was good and a great selection. The service however was really slow and non-attentive. Took 30 minutes after being seated to have wine and sodas at the table. Cute place, but the acoustics need some help, very noisy. Would go back if in the neighborhood.
other This is not an Asian Topless Bar. It is an Asian "Tapas" bar. The guys I was traveling with spent the first ten minutes waiting for the show to start and were disappointed when I smacked them all for actually thinking I would take my coworkers to a topless bar. "Tapas" are little appetizer plates, and Sens is all about getting a little taste of everything. The atmosphere is fantastic - eclectic, moody and very, very cozy (so I recommend reservations). The little dishes are about four single servings, so you'll want to order several plates! Highly recommend the volcano flamed beef and the sugar cane pork. The food is very flavorful -- but everything is a bit spicy (garlicky-spicy), even the dishes they call "mild." Plates run about $6-$9 each, and each person in our party ordered 3 or other plates...we were all full by the time we left! Definitely get a cocktail, their mixed drink menu is fab (White Sin is absolutely sinful...and absolutely worth the indulgence).
other If you ever want to instantly "up" your cool factor with a friend or date, meet them at the Lost Leaf. The mere fact that there is no external sign (other than the tacky "open" sign indicating that it is, indeed, the lost leaf) you would probably never have any idea that the best neighborhood bar in Phoenix is inside. When i am asked to describe the lost leaf to someone who has never been before, it is basically a big open house with the most well-stocked beer fridge you have ever seen.No cocktails or draft, but for atmosphere and quality of beer selection, lost leaf is by far my favorite place to meet people in dtown phoenix.
other Great mall. has pretty much everything.
other Food was delicious, portions were great, and price was very reasonable! Highly recommend
other Great prices with great selection. Great for your everyday shopping needs.
other this was my first visit to a Sizzler and I thought it was pretty good. The shrimp dinner I ordered was not that great but the salad and dessert bar made up for that. The place is no Golden Corral by any means but what they got is pretty good , you will leave with a full belly . the service was good and I was able to make a strawberry shortcake from the dessert bar. So I will say YAY I am a fan!
other This place was the answer to my German grocery shopping dreams! I thank the Yelp community for leading me to Old Heidelberg. I was picking up a number of items for an Oktoberfest party I was cooking for and hosting at my house, and was able to fulfill most of my exotic German needs at this one stop. I picked up pumpernickel rye bread, authentic concentrated Maggi Würze seasoning (not the soy sauce-tasting stuff you find in most American grocery stores) and Knorr zwiebel-kräuter salat krönung. They also had lots of Knorr sauce mixes that you just can't find over here (for instance,  sauerbraten gravy).I stuck around for a few minutes to talk to the two women who ran the place (Andrea and Chris). I volunteered that I had lived in Germany for years, including Berlin and Bavaria.  They were totally friendly and even suggested some other places nearby that I could check out for German grub or rarer German beer selections. I promised I would be back... especially since I spotted that they had frozen leberknödel (liver dumplings). I made these once from scratch years ago but that was a lot of work. Knowing that they carry such delicacies has snagged me hook, line and sinker, as I am now destined to return and once again indulge my German food fantasies.
3 leave it to corporate america to capitalize on a great idea (ipic) and roll it out, steamrolling everyone in the way...--book your seat in advance using the website (fandango's mobile site integration not working at the time of this review)I LOVE LOVE LOVE knowing that my seat is MINE, and if it isn't available, i'll just have to look for another showing--choose from either the exclusive cinema suites (think first class airline seat, and then some), or the more standard and rowdy "fork and screen"--efficient and hardworking servers and food runners.--the concept is excellent, but with declining food quality, it could die off quickly. why would i pay $8 for a (cracked) plastic bowl of popcorn? goddamit!#chicken wings gone south. they're the fatty and mushy "pump-me-full-of-antibiotics-while-i-stand-in-my-own-shit-while-the-steroids-grow-me-bigger-than-my-body-was-ever-going-to-grow-in-90-days-fee-lot-meat" SHIT "chicken"#that means they're cutting other corners too... yikes.#food often arrives "dead" cold. SEND IT BACK.#be careful to be specific when ordering; many items are similar and your server will assume.#effect of dining while you watch has literally put all the nearby restaurants out of business. the esplanade is a ghost townnote to lessees: always put a clause in your contract that competitors in the same property must be approed by you!HINT: push the service button between your seats as soon as you arrive, even if the server stops by to say he'll be right with you. the button starts a timer which sends an "all call" if someone doesn't reach you quickly.
other Are you looking to get a cat? if so, check out PetSmart. My wife and I adopted a kitten here and she's awesome.There are always several cats (occasionally dogs) looking for a good home, some older cats (a few years old and some kittens.) There is an adoption fee, but the cats will come with their shots and are neutered/spayed.We also use this store to get both wet and dry food and toys on occasion. There are many sizes and brands to choose from at good prices. The food is cheaper at PetSmart than Petco, unless the item is on sale.I would recommend to get a PetSmart card to save a few bucks.The store is always clean and staff very friendly and helpful.
other I enjoyed our night at Suede.  My husband I got there early and grabbed a few drinks ($other Trump Vodka drinks- sa-weet!) and headed out to the patio.  I really liked the design of the place, especially the huge outdoor area.  Since we got there early in the night there wasn't a DJ playing yet and the only other patrons were two other young men.  As the night went on the crowd grew ever more interesting- from the undergrads that shared a table with us to the large group of 30/40 something men at the next table to what I would call here in Boston "fashionably challenged" girls and meathead boys.  The DJ started around 10 and man, it brought me right back to my sophomore year in college.  (Circa 2000-2001)  He was spinning all the hits from 7 years ago!  Not that I didn't enjoy my sophomore year, it was awesome, it was just not expected.   Once again, it was another place in Scottsdale where we only spent about $50 or so on drinks for the night.All in all though I did enjoy Suede and my husband and I will definitely be returning.
other Big fan of this store - the owner tries very hard to create an inviting atmosphere for all levels of gamers. Further, the store provides for a host of niches, including euro-games, Ameritrash, role playing, and miniature wargaming. Good amount of supplies (both GW and P3, among others). Lots of tables for miniature gaming, board games, CCGs, and painting in the back (and a fridge with soda). They've started carrying MTG over the last few months, and that collection has grown. Always something going on here, but nothing intimidating. The owner is very, very helpful: willing to answer questions about painting, games, and to make special orders (even trips over to Gilbert at Battlefoam when necessary). Yep, big fan.
other I'm working downtown now (new themed list to come soon!) so I'm exploring the area from a different angle. I'm no stranger to downtown/midtown's happy hour and dinner spots, but I've never had to go out and search for breakfast or lunch during the day. I checked out Focaccia one morning when I hadn't had breakfast yet at the recommendation of my husband, Myles M, who works right around the corner. He said I should order the breakfast burrito, so I did, because he's pushy and I always do what I'm told. Ok, neither of things are true, but in this case, he had conviction and I obediently complied. The breakfast burrito was worth every penny. Being a somewhat recent convert to pescetarianism, I got it with egg whites (cool that they had that option), spinach, green salsa and potatoes. The woman behind the counter made it up right there on the grill and it was warm and delicious. The potatoes were skin-on which gave them a great texture and flavor. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the green salsa had a great kick. The hot coffee from the carafe I got to accompany it was airplane-quality, but next time, I'll just grab something from Cartel on the way back to my office. God knows the burrito alone will be enough to keep me coming back to Focaccia.
other Eaten here a few times. Just finished lunch and had a great salad & sandwich. The salad I had was the spinach with poached egg, it was awesome. My taste is for savory, "umami", this was perfect with the egg bacon and light dressing. The chicken sandwich was good with basil and brie. Then the creme brulee with tahitian vanilla was great. Just a nice quaint place to sit outside and have a good lunch. One problem I have with Zinc Bistro is that they have Stella on tap, great right? But for $7! That's one for $7. Come on, maybe $4. I just bought 1other for $10 at Total Wine.
other Vitality Health and Fitness is a small gym that offers personal fitness, group fitness and fitness classes. The classes and the training programs are all varied, challenging, unique and fun. The members are positive, full of smiles and easy-going. The gym is not intimidating at all, the trainers are kind and build programs that suit your personal fitness levels, and the cost is VERY reasonable.  My husband and I have been working out with Megan, and she's a doll.  We haven't gone for very long so we'll keep you posted on the impending RESULTS!Vitality also offers nutrition and massage -- which we both plan on checking out!  The owner is delightful and easy to work with. If you have any questions or concerns about your costs or the way you are being treated, she works WITH you to ensure you are getting the level of service that you expect and that the club/program can provide. The owner is honest and respectful, fair and reasonable. I think everyone should contact this club and see if it might work for them - you won't be disappointed!
other I am not a fan of american mexican food, good thing they don't serve that fare here. The taquitos take me back to the streets of tijuana without the risk of "after effects" :)
other Lots of awesome stores! Expensive and normal price...it is an indoor mall.  Has Starbucks and a Tiffanys...my two favorites!
other I like spicy. I mean I like to sweat from the bridge of my nose when I eat. When they asked how hot I wanted my green curry chicken, I did a double take. "Isn't green curry spicy by definition?" They told me they make it in varying degrees of spiciness for the ASU crowd. While I disagree with diluting the authenticity of the traditional preparation, I get it - they have a business to run. What I really don't like is how they do it. They make a mild green curry...er, no, green sauce. Then, upon ordering, they add a certain amount of red chili flakes depending on how spicy you want it. This is not only upsetting philosophically, but chili flakes need time to cook in a curry - you don't just drop in, stir and serve. I get the sense that this problem is rampant in Arizona; hope to find a solution soon.
other Very nice place and delicious food!
other Not good. The patio is top notch for relaxing if the weather's good but I couldn't shake that chain feeling when inside. Table and chairs had a slightly sticky feeling to them (nice, eh?). Food was typical pre-cooked, oven heated dollop of too much grease and cheese. Not impressed. It's a shame cause the garden and even the nachos & salsa had me expecting big things.
other The Vig was just okay in my opinion.   I met some friends there for happy hour  on a Friday evening and it was packed.   We did get the drinks/app specials, and all the food we tried was just okay.  The atmosphere was your standard trendy bar/meat market. (i.e. A lot of people trying waaaay to hard to look and act cool.)  We had a good time, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go back there anytime soon. The people I was with we're great, but The Vig  itself was 'meh'...certainly nothing special.
other The black beans are awesome. Also recommend the jerk fried rice. Actually, everything I've had here has been good. Free snickerdoodle with every order. Oh, and the salsa is yummy too.
other Good mongolian bbq - more variety than most. They have some good sauces - Try the mongo bbq or dragon chili.
other I loved this place! A bit pricey, but excellent quality.Been here twice and haven't had anything we didn't like. The meat is great quality and they'll cook it how you desire as opposed to places that won't cook something below medium well.Great toppings for burgers, fries and shakes. Although everything is so big and filling I certainly can't have all that in one trip!Definitely a decadent tasty treat.
3 This place was just okay.  While I can't claim to be an expert in Korean food, I am used to the Korean bbq restaurants in Los Angeles and I can say that this place cannot compete with those restaurants.  First, they didn't seem to have the proper ventilation for Korean BBQ.  I have never been to a place where you could see smoke throughout the restaurant from people cooking at their table.  Second, the service was AWFUL.  It took them forever to just greet us and bring us water and the fact that it was toooo HOT in there did not make us happy to wait 1other minutes for our water or for someone to even acknowledge our presence.  The food was decent but the seafood pancake was super disappointing.  They didn't even chop up the green onions that they put in it (seriously, like entire stalks of green onion) and it had no seasoning...  I may give this place another shot but as for now, I'd give them 2.other stars if I could.
other great merch. great prices. although..it's a bit sketchy getting out of the parking lot. you have to back up in a major street. is there anywhere else to park?
other I have been coming to Lai Lai's for many years now and have never had a bad experience!  The food is always great, and if you mess it up you have no one to blame except yourself since you decide what all you want in your bowl lol.  Sometimes I don't make it in for a year or so but the staff always remembers me and that makes me feel very much at home.  Lai Lai's is great!
other It's ok, good for a quick bite. I don't understand the almost cult like following.Made a mistake and had the shake instead of pop and was sick for hours.Staff was very friendly, but they needed someone dedicated to keeping the place clean.
other Love it and love the GF menu.  It's amazing how many dishes they have
3 I'm torn.I LOVED my $20 facial. I'll probably go back for more once Groupon and the like run out of deals.However, I also got a brow and eyelas tinting.  I wouldn't recommend that service from here.  My brows were uneven, and my lashes faded out quicker than normal.
other We went over for dinner- had the spring rolls, chicken curry, and lemongrass chicken. The spring rolls and lemongrass chicken were about a 3 star, but the chicken curry was really good and made up for the others. We also had the coconut water, which was fresh. Prices were reasonable we paid around $30.
other Great service by the owner (Nick).  He's very accommodating and aims to please.  Friendly and helpful.  I hadn't had an Indian fry bread in over 10 years.  There were several meat choices to choose from and several vegetables to add on top.  Unfortunately an earlier catering order cleaned them out of re-fried beans and bell peppers.  The salsa was good, spicy but not hot.  The owner kept the place open for me to enjoy my meal while we chatted.  He even stayed open later to feed another customer that walked in after the place had been closed for 10 mins.  He even gave me a coupon for my next visit.  A truly caring owner.  Nice place in a strip mall with plenty of parking.
other when i worked in retail my paycheck was spent before i got paid. therefore, i relied heavily on coupons and splitting meals w all of my other poor college friends.well, i hit the jackpot. $1other coupon for a FEAST. the picture on the coupon showed everything we would get: a huge steak, shrimp, and lobster PLUS other sides. there were 3 of us- this was PLENTY. it was prom night too so we were initally fooled with how popular it was. popular for prom girls with light up clear shoes (not even lying), if that says anything about the crowd for you...our waitress stops by our booth and just stares at us. one of my friend kinda looks around at me and our other friend, then back at the waitress. 'ill have a diet coke?'then our waitress writes it down and doesn't say anything but looks at my other friend.i lost it and started laughing. why isn't she talking to us? this is so weird. we ended up asking for a different waitress, then found out the coupon was a big fat liar. you didn't get all of that. it just says you do but you don't. the food ended up being nasty. probably one of the worst meals ive ever had. as we're leaving susy talks a lot waitress trips over my friend and it was all too awkward bc i couldn't control laughing. awful food, awful service, AND the bathrooms were some of the grossest i had ever been in. if wal-mart ran a restaurant, this would be it.
other OK guys (and gals too), I know size isn't everything, but OMG, this place has crazy size portions and I loooove it!  We ordered the calamari and the stuffed mushrooms (1/other orders) and STILL, the servings were huge.  Six big stuffed mushrooms sitting on what seemed to me to be the biggest plate I have ever seen serving an appetizer.  They were great and tasty, but cooled down too quickly and who can do anything about that?  The calamari was decent, could have been spiced up a bit or served with something more than marinara sauce, but for those who don't like a lot of fan fare with their food, this would be perfect; classic calamari with classic sauce.  We loved the Stella Artois draft beer and martinis came out big and filled to the brim, just how I like them.  For our entrees we ordered the Baked Ziti and Sausage and the Rigatoni "D".  Both of them were absolutely fantastic...yumm.  And both were HUGE.  The baked ziti stayed warm right up until we packed the rest to take home because they actually bake it right in the ceramic type dish that they serve it in, very smart.  For those with little ones, the kids menu is awesome and probably the healthiest meal a kid is going to get anywhere.  Nothing at this place is pre packaged or pre made and that goes for the kids meals as well.  Their chicken fingers are home made (the pickiest of adults would eat these things!), no french fries; home made mashed potatoes and broccoli florets.  This is the KIDS menu!  Our waiter needed to be coaxed out of his shell, but he was still warm in that great way that the good ones know how to do without intruding.  Great leather booths, linen napkins, white table cloths with a white and red checkered one thrown on top for added warmth, elegant, but not stuffy.  Guys could go in with t-shirts and dress shorts and fit right in and for the ladies who like to dress up, you can as well with out feeling overly so.I am definitely going here again, what a find!
3 So Chase field you get 3 stars.Here's the problem(s) I have with the venue or CONS so to speak.1. Cash Only almost EVERYWHERE, for a stadium named after a bank, don't you think someone would have taken finacial practice into better concern, perhaps CHASE just wants to sucker you more by making you pay their ATM fees if your not a member which I see as "Greedy Fat Cat" practices. 2. No real options in regards to "regular" ball park food, the Brats are a joke and at 6 bucks a pop, they don't even offer peppers and onions, strange that it shows it in the menu picture. Other than that it's just another typical "let's capitalize all we can" with your typical crap chains (Fridays, Panda Express, etc) which I find pretty disgusting.  3. The "Value" beer stands..... Okay, when is a beer a "value" at other dollars, I mean  seriously, being that I just paid 6 bucks for a brat that's pretty pathetic I'd at least like the decency of having a good size beer to help wash down the piss boiled frank I just overpaid the crap out of for. To sum it up, the value beer is tiny and the only one worth buying IMO is the 9 dollar 2other ouncer or even better, the 10.50 Corona, HA.Here's the PROS.1. Damn good deal on seating prices, we sat in section 140 (lower level outfield) for 1other bucks a person, Not too shabby! 2. The stadium is rather beautiful, for a stadium that is. 3. There's a pool in the outfield, cool idea 4. Parking is rather cheap (1other bucks) and has never seemed to be an issue.5. Traffic control before and after games is surprisingly smooth Overall 3 stars, I just think they need more originality instead of what "Joe Sixpack" wants while charging him Paris Hilton prices.
other Second to worst dining experience of all time.Our waitress was a little timid, which is fine, but it we shouldn't have to wait 20 minutes just to order our food.  Our food took 45+ minutes to arrive, and while our friend's steak came out hot, our Hibachi Steak and Potatoes were room temperature.  Sent it back to be warmed, they offered to pay for it, which is great.  Both managers came and said hi and apologized for the slow cook staff, and made sure everything was great. That was the last we saw of them for the next half hour.  We finished our meals, and 10 minutes later, had to flag down a different waitress to go and find our waiter, and to bring us cheesecake menus.  We always get the Dulce de Leche, but they brought us terrimisu or some junk.  I gave it back to the waiter (after walking the restaurant to hunt him down) and said "no thanks, I'll just pass on the cheesecake."  He looked surprised, and later said we didn't have to pay for that cheesecake.  Well I'd sure hope not!Two hours of my life are gone.  I usually like this restaurant, but tonight's service disaster will prevent me from EVER going to this location again, free food or not.
other Hostess staff were a few unorganized morons-- it appeared as if it was literally their first night on the job. Maybe too many of them? The service was fast but I wouldn't say friendly. She made a few mistakes with our order-- gave my daughter a cheese pizza when we ordered pepperoni..  She put a glass right in front of my 2other mo old who grabbed it right away of course-- few other rookie mistakes like that. Calamari- gross. Lobster/crab tacos with white bland rice-- don't order it. My husband was happy with ribeye and atmosphere is cool and clean.
other I've never been to a restaurant where we (a party of 6 with a reservation) sat at a cleared table with no water, no bread, no cutlery, no service for 1other minutes before receiving a menu .... when we finally had someone provide a menu, it then took another 1other minutes to get the wine we ordered. Still no bread, still no food. The server dumped the wine bottle on the table (unopened), and went to find glasses. 10 minutes later she then threw the bottle opener at our table so we could open the wine ourselves while she went to find glasses. Most (!?!) of the wine glasses arrived within the next 10 minutes, and still no bread or food. Do I need to go on? And while the server apologized profusely, she never offered to take anything off the bill or even a dessert on the house for our clearly disgruntled group. Food was fine -- the house-made burrata is quite remarkable. But not enough of a reason to return. Others we were with have had better experiences, and I would hope for the owner's sake that our dinner was an aberration...
other I had always heard great things about Pita Jungle, but it wasn't until a recent visit there that I became a believer. Really great food for a reasonable place!

Whoa. What a liberal hip person coding of an entrance if I ever saw one! Inside, a bright modern airy space with concrete floors, exposed ceiling beams, bright green walls and exposed stainless steel industrial kitchen, I was super impressed by the brightness the huge windows gave the place as well as the cutting edge furniture. The menus are charming chalkboard options that have breakfast all day, kid's menu and lunch served after 11am. All priced between $4-$11, alas there are vegetarian options but this is NOT a butter free place. In fact, it is a fucking BUTTER PARTY. So get your LacTaid if you can do it!The slightly hipster staff (the guys look like that dude who played Keats in Bright Star) are amiable at the counter but after ordering my garden veggie sammie I was dismayed to realize they had pastry cases hidden in the counter (you just basically look up the whole time then realize after swiping your debit card your other options). Also the drink menu is awkwardly displayed to the far right of the main menus (um, I would've wanted a soy latte instead of coffee...). After paying at the register, there is the bizarre scramble of figuring out what you have to get yourself.There is a large bevy cooler that has wine, beer, soda, juice, water, etc and was a very healthy selection (not a poor one at all). Awkwardly placed is the water, iced tea and coffee station where people are trying to read the menu before ordering. Most tables are four person tables with two people seating around the windows and large community tables towards the L-shaped back, along with bar/counter seating that views the cooks station. Each time I went I ended up at the same four-person table near the condiment table stocked w/catsup, Sriracha, Cholula hot sauce (oh shit). My first experience I got ginger beer and a veggie sandwich. Now, as a vegetarian for over 1other years, and a lactose-intolerant for over other years, my expectations were way low. Instead, I was fucking IMPRESSED. The bread ended up soggy due to the herbs mayonaisse cream dill sauce thing with incredible local roasted veggies with really good bread. OMFG. I mean seriously, I can't remember much of the meal cause my brain went somewhere spiritual. I also got the fresh fruit on the side, and a great deal with fresh berries, grapes, kiwi, etc. I managed to fit it all in my tummy (and felt def. overstuffed-I should've kept 1/other of it). My companions had the pulled pork sandwich and killed it, the other had pancakes.Today, I woke up and I wanted breakfest. Not Essence, Gallo Blanco, Lux, Wildflower, def. NOT Harlows, I wanted fancy pants American style breakfast I hadn't had a billion times before. Located right off the I-10, it's a fast drive from Tempe, and I didn't know what to expect for a crowd around 10:30 on a Tuesday. Turns out, Tim and I were def. the median age here. Mostly older patrons, couples, families, business deals, co-workers, moms with toddlers (they have plenty of nice high-chairs, btw). I had to get the pancakes ($6) w/fruit ($1) and side of potatoes ($3) and coffee. Tim got the rotassarie chicken with grilled corn and hand cut french fries (I think under $10). Seating was easy, food came out together within 1other minutes. The pancakes were delicate, almost crepe like, with a buttermilk taste but not too cinnamony and a little dry and thin (in a good way-sops up the butter and syrup). The serving of fruit on top was a little small, but all good quality, the potatoes were home-made style with sauted onions, skins still on.  His plate was huge with a grilled corn, the fries still had the skin on, and the chicken looked great and very greasy (which he killed). We had to remember to get our own utensils, napkins, and our own drinks but the staff checked in periodically and after finishing our plates, the dirty dishes sat around for other minutes, I believe due to the insane lunch rush that came in! Seriously, the place exploded! I was happy Tim had bought the cookies he eyed earlier so we skidaddled after using the nice, clean bathrooms. Now, eating yummers Blondie cookie and chocolate chip cookies that are greased through the paper bag, I think I will have to ride my bike here to justify the butter party celebration!
other Returned here after a year's absense. I understand they have had a change in management. some for the better, some for the worse. new general manager and now the service seems much friendlyer and efficient. New chef and now food is slow to arrive and not as good as it used to be. steak was charred, mashed potatos were lukewarm. Took over 30 minutes for our food to arrive. hopefully it was just an off night for the kitchen. but the general feel was that they lost the attention to the little details
3 I'm in agreement with Anandita: If you've got to shop at a Whole Foods, this is the one. The only attitude I got was from a couple cougaresque velour-tracksuited shoppers, not from the staff (who were all refreshingly down-to-earth and friendly).If you're straying from mainstream essentials, they are surprisingly price competitive (or even cheaper than) mass-market grocers. For "normal" food it's still Whole Foods and still often inordinately expensive. Their meat department usually makes me laugh.But if you're looking for something weird enough even Sprouts doesn't carry it, chances are Whole Food not only has it but has an employee who can tell you all about it.
3 This place is old but the food is good. The compliments arent that great...such as the basil and bean sprouts they give out. Their soy milk is made fresh and does not come from a Yeo's can.
other This place is great.  I met up with a friend there for drinks after work.  I love the bar which has a garage type door that opens up so you can sit outside or inside.  Great intimate vibe outside under a big tree with lights.  Great warm vibe inside.  Great mix of basics and mexi-cali items like ceviche and tacos and burgers and mac and cheese.
other I love this restaurant concept. It makes for a fun dinner between friends and family. I wish there were ones like it in Central Phoenix so I don't have to drive a half hour for good food and a good dining experience. The veggie options offered are plentiful and fresh, which is important to me. The broth is so flavorful. But be warned weak tongued restaurant-goers, the spicy broth has a kick that will stick!Some are saying it's too expensive? I think it's worth it.
other Just visited this morning and had a great experience. The staff was friendly, and the coffee was great. I had a raspberry muffin and iced toddy. Muffin was large and full of flavor. The owner was kind enough to give me a sample of the toddy (iced coffee brewed for 2other hrs i believe) My husband got the quiche which was light and fluffy and I'll order next time for sure. I loved the vintage plates they give you, and the atmosphere is inviting and airy.  It is kind of a cramped space when busy, but worth any wait and maneuvering.
3 I had seen these around before but never stopped in. Started with a drink menu and was quite happy. Good selection of Margaritas and others. The dinner menu was good as well. Drinks were excellent and food was tasty.I'll make a return trip if for nothing more than a drink. A-OK.
other Sweet Potato Tater Tots..................why are you still reading?  what more needs to be said?  Yum Yum getcha some!The only thing keeping them from other stars is their unwillingness to enforce rules with parents who bring kids and think everybody else wants to enjoy watching them run around the place like its a playground, its NOT - keep your kids at the table or at home.
3 Its not in a shell gas station anymore and i guarantee that Guy would never visit the new location on his show. I ordered the El Pastor burrito and i didn't like it at all, very dry and just not to my liking. I would never order it again but I'm sure there are alot of people out there that like it. The salsa was great and i couldn't get enough of it. I ate half of a bean and cheese burrito and i really liked that also, not the greatest tortillas ever but they are possibly #3. I would could back and id like to try some other type of burrito or some carne asada tacos.
other Love this store!
other I was really pleased with Bombay Spice..it's definitely not your typical Indian restaurant setting.. Think more contemporary American decor... I mean The Smiths were playing on the stereo which gave it a nice relaxing casual vibe. We were served by a great friendly waitress who really knew the food and explained everything real well.. You can tell she was very excited about it. We started with the appetizer sampler which had four selections of appetizers of your choosing..all were outstanding especially the wings and the chickpea ceviche.  I then tried the Chicken Tikka Masala which had lots of great flavor and a nice kick then we checked in on Yelp and got a free dessert. Great prices and the way you order the food makes it really simple.. Great little casual place tucked away in the corner of a strip mall near PV mall.
other Saigon Pho doesn't have a fancy sign, great decor or even windows you can look in/out of. But who cares when you have the most amazing Pho in the valley (and at the best prices)? The servings are very big and everything averages about $6 a plate. Staff is very attentive and quick to deliver the goods.As you can read through the various other reviews - everyone has a favorite dish. I have a problem with gluttony so I can't suggest a single dish - I can only suggest them all. However, this place also has some of the best Salt and Pepper calamari I've ever had.
3 I don't like mega-chain pizza.  I don't like Domino's.  I don't care for Papa John's.  I've never had Hungry Howie's because frankly on their flyers it looks horrifying.  And I will never ever eat Little Caesar's again in my life . . . but I gotta admit, Pizza Hut makes a decent thin crust pizzaThere were a few great locally owned pizza joints where I used to live in Tempe.  Tessio's and Boulders On Broadway stand out, but ya know what?  Sometimes you don't want to pay $20 $2other bucks for an extra large 3 topping pizza.  Sometimes you just want something decent for only $10 $1other bucks.  Sometimes you really DO want a decent cheap pizza delivered to your door in 30 minutes or lessThe three years I lived nearby, I probably ordered Pizza Hut delivery or takeout once every couple of months, and I've never had anything to complain about at this location on BroadwayPS - the boneless spicy bbq wings are dangerously addictive
other We are lucky enough to live basically right accross the street.  The food is great. Love the thin crust pizzas and the sweet potato fries. They grow a lot of their own veggies. They seasonally sell dates at the farmstand that are GREAT. You get your food free on your birthday.Gets very crowded on the weekends!the dessert is just OK, but the shakes are great!
other I really enjoy this place. It's beautifully designed. It's hidden in a historic neighborhood, (zoning issues so no patio), and they make they own tonic! ---What else does one need? But now the food. Rich, full flavored, comfort food. I don't think there is a cuisine style here as far as I could tell, just some of the best food around. Had the fontina crusted with pinko and walnuts, awesome. A potato side dish, damn good I tell you. For the main course the skirt steak, which was some of the best red meat I'm had in a very, very long time. This is my vote for best new restaurant in Phoenix. Seriously.
other Had the best BEST time here tonight! My mama and best girlfriends treated to me a fun day for my birthday and I insisted on wrapping up the afternoon with happy hour on me. I've never been but we wanted to go somewhere nice and stopped in. The restaurant is beautiful- we sat in a high back comfy booth in the bar which is really nice. The bar has shelves of backlit colorful liquor bottles above it (ala the Ocean Club bar). We has other rounds, including the Vitamin C martini, White Chocolate Martini, Flirtini and Black Cherry cocktail- they were all really great! We also got the colossal shrimp appetizer (which technically weren't all that colossal, they were just normal), the sliders (the bacon and maytag bleu cheese was amazing!) and the AZ Eggrolls (a bit on the greasy side but very tasty and perfect for happy hour). The tab was only $6other (it was happy hour and the prices averaged about $6/ drink and app). The service was also extremely good. It's been a long time since I felt like raving about a restaurant- it was great!
other I had a small fender bender in a hospital parking lot a few months back.  No big deal, and the other driver's insurance company immediately took responsibility, so all I needed to do was get an estimate and get it fixed.They were quick but thorough with the estimate, and when I brought my car back for the repair, they found some additional hidden damage, contacted the insurance company, secured a promise from them to pay the shop directly (so I didn't have to pay then wait for the insurance company to reimburse me), and still had everything done as promised, when promised, and they called me a few times to update me on the progress.The only thing that I would like to see would be some courtesy transportation, even if it would only be offered within a certain radius.All in all, they made the process as painless as possible.  Strong 9 out of 10; if they offered to drop me off and pick me up at work at no additional charge, it'd be a 10 out of 10.I hope I don't need a body shop in the future, but if I do, I wouldn't hesitate to bring my car back to Brighton Collision Centers.
other Love Abuelos! Best Mexican food!
other After several hundred professional massages over the past 20 years, I encountered today a first -- a massage therapist who explained that she could not do a massage involving any but mild pressure using her hands. It was an issue of "protecting the thumbs." When I told her I didn't like forearms and elbows, she explained that she'd never worked without using her forearms (and, I assume, her elbows, too). After just five minutes, when I asked for more pressure, she suggested we stop the massage -- that she wasn't the "therapist for [me]." She was right. What are they teaching these people these days, and why doesn't an excellent outfit like LifeTime Fitness insist on better skills among its massage staff? I won't offer her name, but, if considering a massage at this establishment, I suggest Casie as the only therapist here worth the money.
other This is the best place if you want to escape Arizona and feel a bit of wine country. Best place to spend a Sunday afternoon. My favorite part is uncorking a bottle of wine, and ordering lunch to be eaten outdoors. So spring weather is the best. Buy a mini loaf of bread and try their delicious olive oils and spreads...super inexpensive appetizer at just $1.50 and the samples are free.  They offer many sandwiches and the waffles with berries are to die for. Looking forward to trying their pizza...on my next visit. Regardless of what you choose follow up with gellatto...yum or take home some olive oil cupcakes. Delicious and moist...but a little spendy
other As a travel consultant for cre8adventures.com, we came away impressed. This is a moderately priced getaway of unquestionable value. For travelers seeking style in an in-town locale, this chic desert retreat may currently fall behind the Mondrian, but it easily surpasses Chaparral Suites next door. The staff is showing off its Kimpton training, and the service standards were very welcome. This hotel gets high marks on all fronts.Taggia, the hotel's new restaurant, is a stylish Italian venue with a unique Ligurian-anchored menu that features fresh seafood and creative traditionally inspired dishes. A large kiva-style fireplace warms the alfresco section, and waterfalls surround it.The only downside is that Kimpton hasn't fully finished up on the room makeovers yet. Compared with Kimpton's usual attention to room furnishings and design, these digs are mild-mannered. The older patterned carpeting was disappointing.Still Kimpton has done an admirable and feverish job at making over this property. Kudos.
other It isn't often enough that I get to dine at Carlsbad, but last night I decided to have dinner there. I'll be completely honest, service is always a mixed bag. But then you figure when they're crammed to the gills (which is generally how it goes), you can't always expect Speedy freaking Gonzales to be your server. However, last night I don't think I could have sneezed between the time I ordered my food and when it arrived to my table. Excellent.. is all I can say about this joint.If you're looking for some tasty New Mexican fare, get over there!! And if it's packed, let the valet park your car(CUZ ITS FREE)! Start off with a Dos Equis Amber, get some nachos(this vegetarian WILL eat the niblets of chicken in them nachos cuz it's just that tasty) and kick back. Preferably on the patio...because there's a waterfall!!! And if Jacob's working the bar.. expect nothing but the best in cocktails... seriously.
other Came to town for work and remembered coming to Thai Elephant the last time I was in town and loving it. Walked here with friends and the name had changed. The wait staff saw my confusion and quickly reassured me that the name and menu had slightly changed but the food was basically the same. I had the curry fish last time and was craving it so I tried it again and yes, still absolutely delicious. Tried the calamari and crab wontons as appetizers. The calamri was solid but the crab wontons were only okay. A little too fried and in a skin that didn't feel like wonton skin. The curries that came to our table looked pretty neutral colored and the noodle dishes, instead of being on the red side or the dark brown side was also very neutral colored. Since I didn't taste those dishes, I can't legitimately penalize the restaurant but I have to admit that I hesitate to order anything else besides the fish because of their appearance. I'm still going to give this place other stars because of the taste of the food I ordered, the good service and the fact they had brown rice as an option. If ever I'm brave enough to stray off the path, my rating may change. But in the meantime, check this place out and order the curry fish on their specialties menu. I ordered it level other - hot and it was just the right amount of heat.
other Great iced tea. Terrific Roast Beef and mashed potatoes. Love the biscuits. You can't go wrong at Cracker Barrel.
other No credit, weird layout,  not much fresh food
other Q: How many people and how many minutes does it take to make a "toasty" sub?A: At Quiznos?  A LOT.The food is decent, especially the tuna melt, and $other for a large is a great deal.  But this place is SO incredibly slow, every time I go there I swear it's the last time.  Alas, living across the street from it I have caved and gone back a few times...  But seriously, don't come here if you've got groceries in the trunk, kids waiting in the car, or anywhere you need to be in the next hour.  Also: I can't stand the oregano powder crap they dump on every sub.  Come on, Quiznos, there's gotta be a better-tasting distinctive touch.  I always tell them to leave this stuff off, and half the time they put it on anyway. FYI - once the sandwich is out of the toasting machine, toppings are available by request only.  No one's gonna ask what you want on it like at Subway.  You really have to speak up if you want onions, olives, or whatever else they've got hiding back there.Please God grant me the willpower to stop coming back to this Quiznos!!!!!!
other A very professional company that takes the time to deal with you on a personal level.  With great reassurance from Nate and his team they were able to handle the short sale of our home with very little stress and in a timely manner.They really helped when we thought no one could.  From beginning to end we were always kept informed and they got the job done.
3 I was so looking forward to going to this restaurant.  It has a nice view of a man-made pond, but the food is barely average.  If the ambience wasn't so nice, it would get only other stars.
3 While I like the food here, it seems like the service is just really hit and miss.  Just went a few nights ago, and after waiting 20 minutes for my food, I was informed they were out of what I ordered.  Then, they were out of forks and fortune cookies.  That being said, when they do have my order, the food is always fresh and flavorful.  The management seems to realize when there are issues, as they have provided free appetizers and such when we were unhappy.  Overall, a decent place, but might have to start trying other locations.
other Great library...take your canned food to donate all during APRIL and they wave off your fines- GREAT cause, GREAT deal and now fine free!
3 Good food, but I don't care for the SUPER FAST waitstaff. Fast is one thing, but walking away while I am still trying to order is RUDE.
other Super Dark Chocolate Gelato.  Word.  Tiramisu Gelato.  Straight Up.  Super Dark Chocolate Gelato and Tiramisu together.  Good Stuff.  This store smells like a pool.  I have no idea what's up with that but the Super Dark Chocolate Gelato is awesome.I will go back just for that.  And I will order the largest size I can handle...Kids Size.  Or maybe Small if I'm feeling ambitious.  Gelato is rich.  Super Dark Chocolate Gelato is Super Rich.  You've been warned.
other This place is excellent.  Hands down, the best tacos I've had.  Fresh and flavorful meats and great salsas.  I see people raving about some of the "salsa bars" at all of the 'berto's and such but the salsa there is like water compared to what Tacos Atoyac has to offer.  They care about what they are serving and take pride in their craft.If you like the style of food here you must try Sonora Mesquite Grill on 46th Street and Thomas.
other Formerly Sandbar, this is a great new spot in Central Scottsdale to chill out after work. Good Mexican food, good strong drinks, and a massive outdoor patio with pleanty of drinking activities. They also have plenty of TVs to watch the big game. FYI - It gets slammed on weekend nights...
3 Place is OK, I'm just not a big fan of what they have to offer! It's funny reading some of the complaints! People get a grip! Food is good, place is a cafe style, so your service is really up to you! Cookies are really good, my wife enjoys their sandwiches.
other I LOVE LOVE me some Joe's real bbq!!  They have the best ribs in town and their bake beans are amazing!  There's little pieces of meat mixed in with the beans and it's sooo good.  Their mac and cheese is great as well as their corn.  Pretty much everything is great here.  The first time I went here was when I first moved out to AZ back in 2006.  My fiance took me here because he knows I'm a bbq fanatic, and I swear I though to myself, "What is this place?  A cafeteria?".  I did not expect the food to be any good at all.  Well, was I took quick to judge!  Taught me never to judge a book by it's covers again!  Even though you get in line, pick up a tray and order your food like you would to the lunch lady in HS, the food is the best.  They even have an outdoor seating area with trees and lights.  It makes you feel like you're at a nice park having a nice bbq.Joe's is hands down my favorite bbq joint in the valley.  Nothing tops this.  Anything you order is amazing.Oh, and try their chocolate chip cookie.  Soft and melty and so so good!
other Had an opportunity to take our Canadian guests to Aiello's for supper on the weekend.  It was a a moderate drive but we were not disappointed.  We were rewarded with pleasant surroundings, attentive service and good food.  The complementary hot pepper starter was unusual and tasty when coupled with the fresh bread.  The Mushroom Ravioli Special was especially enjoyed by my spouse and the other entrees brought favorable reviews from our guests.  All in all an enjoyable dining experience.
other If Einstein Bros is the benchmark at 3 stars, then Bruegger's barely earns other stars.Customer service is mediocre. Only one gal (who I've seen a few times) actually smiles, makes eye contact, and seems pleased to be working here. Everyone else acts inconvenienced that I am there.If you order a simple bagel w/cream cheese, you will be O.K. They are not bad, but nothing special. If you order a bagel sandwich, be sure to bring a towel as they leak a lot and turn soggy after a few minutes.Coffee is O.K., but nothing special. Store cleanliness? It could be better. The beverage counter (with the lids and coffee creamers etc.) is often messy and sticky. I noticed that there is a duplicate entry for this location, so I'm pasting this review on the other as well.
other I've been coming to Yusefs now for awhile to get gyro meat to go, along with their fresh feta, pitas and cucumber yogurt. BEST I'VE HAD! Finally I was able to eat there as they have a kitchen and OMG, it was delis and the prices are fabulous. I ordered the lentil soup and holy cow, it was UNREAL! I got the gyro plate with gyro meat and fresh rice (basmati?) and it was fabulous. Gyro Greek salad was amazing too. I love coming here because the owner is nice and very sweet!!!!!I recommend you try this little gem!! It's worth the drive!
other The best gyro you will have in Arizona...or maybe anywhere.Love the grocery selection.Everyone there is really nice.And you can buy a BUCKET of dates for like $6.
other I got to stay here for work and had the best time! They have so many pools. I would spend my afternoons in the smaller pools and have the pool all to myself. It was great! They let me send free postcards which was fun, too. My room was beautiful. It was large and had great amenities. Food was disgusting though. I didn't have access to a car so I was pretty limited to eating hotel food for a week. Everything I ordered was gross and I tried it ALL!I thought customer service was fine--not great, just adequate.
3 This club has great bands.  I saw 68 Guns and Metal Elvis here.  Also at the Metal Elvis show was a Van Halen tribute band called VH Too.  The music is top notch and it is usually not too crowded so you can go right up to the stage.  However, there are only a few tables, which is annoying if you need a place to put your drink or coat or something.  I also wish the ceilings were a bit higher.  Would be better if they could combine an indoor/outdoor area with the stage.  Overall the building seems cramped, small and old.  The prices are reasonable though.  The location is kind of strange however.  We took a cab there but when we wanted to leave we couldn't get one to come pick us up despite the staff saying they called one.  Finally we walked to a gas station and called from there.  This reminds me too much of Club Red.  Great bands, crappy club.  I hope that someone opens a brand new club for bands of this caliber.  Or else I will need to open one myself.
other I went to Sutra to attend the mixer where Yelp was being featured. After soaking in the cool "sceney" vibe, I decided that I was hungry. I asked the waitress for a menu. When she came back she told me that the right hand side of the menu was half off and made a couple suggestions. I love the names of the rolls that Sutra has. There were selections like "Cougar" and "30k millionaire". I had one of each. As if the rolls were made to live up to their namesakes, they didn't impress me; they merely annoyed me. The lack of freshness and flavor were the biggest factors in Sutra's failure. I ended up leaving plenty of sushi on my plate, but I was relieved that they were half off, otherwise I would have returned them upon first bite. I would not eat at Sutra again if I had a choice. I would advise you to eat elsewhere and come to Sutra to see and be "scene"!
3 Seriously the best 3am quesadilla I have ever had.  It was big and gooey, with just enough browning on the outside of the tortilla to make it a little bit crisp.  As an added bonus it was kind of cold outside, so it made a great hand warmer as well.  Why only 3 stars?  OK, you do have to sit on some questionable outside picnic tables and I don't want to think about how clean the kitchen may or may not be, but the entertainment value of watching tipsy people stumble around while waiting for their food can't be beat.
other Out of business
other Why am I trying to hide my love...I'm at Gallo Blanco Cafe at least three times a week.  Yes, it's totally convenient.  But then again, so is that Rice Stick in a Bowl place around the corner and I'm never there!  I'm trading in my four stars for five stars.  I never get tired of the food (which is totally delish), the drinks, the jolt in the coffee, the servers...and THE HOTEL!!  You guys always treat me well, and I can see you treat everyone else like a rock star too.Thanks for being a great 'light rail convenient' local business!
other I recently stayed at the Sheraton for two nights while attending a conference in Phoenix. I was blown away by the services. This is by far the best service I have received while staying at a hotel in recent years. I received a room on the 1other floor. Room was what you expect from Sheraton. The view from the room really sucked!! I got the room with a view of the hotel satellite and communications towers. TV quality was good and room had Starbucks coffee. Room also came with a refrigerator. I would like to see Sheraton move to Nespresso machines. After a long day attending a conference was great to relax at the hotel lobby bar. The desserts are yummy. I didn't get a chance to try the restaurants in the hotel. Hooters and Starbucks are directly across the street. My work colleague used the gym. He said the pool was really nice and gym had everything you need. Next time!!! I would definitely stay here again!!
other Great Pizza! Great food! Great service! Still, this place isn't perfect....BE PREPARED TO WAIT! Alright, most people seem to know this going in (we did too). However, when you arrive at 7:00pm, and they say you won't be seated until 11:30pm, that doesn't mean you can put your name in and show up at 11...which we almost found out the hard way: **At 10:00pm they will do one last head count. If you're not in the vicinity, soooorrrrry!** Luckily we were calling in every hour for updates (which they recommend, btw). At 9:40pm we called and got the news that we better be there for the last head count (information we probably could have used earlier), and had to hurry on back from our meanderings downtown. At 10:00pm we were deemed worthy to stay on the list and wait another 4other minutes or so.Service: the hostess knows she holds all the cards--sort of like the lady at the cash register for the Soup Nazi. However, a smile was all it took to get one back from her for me. Still, I can see how others might misconstrue her attitude as something less than cordial. Our server was great though! Very helpful and fun. He was as excited to serve us as we were to eat there. Good stuff!The pizza is indeed great! But after waiting other hours, I was expecting the heavens to part and birds to sing and the ground to shake. Nope. Just made-from-scratch, meticulously-thought-out, high-quality pizza. A light and airy, smoky crust, a decent sauce and fresh mozzarella formed the basis of the Sonny Boy and Wise Guy pizzas that we tried. The quality and tastiness of the toppings were also apparent. We were impressed. This was absolutely great pizza--one of the best we've ever had. ...I just don't know if I'll hurry back to Pizzeria Bianco to wait that long again.
other Oh Rhythm Room, how I adore thee!I have seen some of the greatest Blues legends play here and have never been disappointed.   Whenever The Rhythm Room All-stars play, I definitely try to make it.  They are rockin'.  I dig the dancing, the bbq (mmmmmm)  and I enjoy when the f*ck the police guy is roller skating on the dance floor!I do recommend getting there early if you want a table and a chair.  For bands I really want to see I get there before they open, get in line, get a table, then someone in my party goes to grab us some bbq and we start drinking and eating and waiting for the music to start!  I always have a great time here!  And now that you can't smoke it's even better!
other This deli style restaurant has everything you want.  Good service, inviting atmosphere, super clean appearance and most of all freshly prepared food that is attractive and delicious!I had the Salmon BLT.  I did not even have to ask the friendly order taker to make the bacon crisp or the salmon to be slightly charred.  Everything about this wonderful sandwhich was perfect.  To be honest, I would switch out the the shredded iceberg lettuce for spinach leaves.  Still the sandwhich was terrific with it's nice proportion and the aioli sauce to bring it all together.My dining comanion had the spinach and sirloin salad which was also completely finished at the end of the meal.  By the looks of the empty bowl it came in- it must have been really good!There are some other items on the menu I look forward to trying out next time, like the wood fired pizzas and the burgers.Great location in the heart of old town Gilbert.  Galleries and other small businesses are in the same area.A great find.  I will definitely go back!
other This is a wonderful little find.  We sat on the 2nd floor patio and it was the perfect fix for a busy day.  We sipped wine in front of the fire and watched the sky change colors over Camelback Mountain.  The service was fabulous.  They didn't rush us and without asking, split our shared orders for us.  The food was fabulous!  OMG!  You HAVE to get the walnut Gorgonzola salad with the warm sweetened balsamic dressing.  Mmmm.  I would get that again in a heartbeat.  We also split a flatbread with fries and it was excellent as well.  I will definitely go back.
3 Enter your credit card information..chose your wash type....enter wash.....ahh clean.The automatic wash at this place is great and touch-less! I used to have to get out of my car and remove the antenna, so it wouldn't be sucked into those heavy foam sheets that touch car washes use. I never understood the point of those, but as a kid, was frightened by them. It was like your car was being engulfed and swallowed, I felt like Captain Ahab, in the belly of the white wale.   With this touch-less wash, no need to worry about antennas, mirrors, or anything else protruding from your car, or feeling like a character from classic literature. The prices are meh for what you get, just spend the extra other $ and get the 8$ wash. It gets your car super clean, and has a full dry at the end. 6$ bucks gets you no dry, and 7$ gets you a mediocre wash, that will make you say "did I get my car washed at all?" With the 8$ you get this special Green Foam spray stuff, and extra rinse and polish deal. This place would be other stars if they wash options were better, but overall it's not a bad place to get your car clean. They have vacuums and vending machines that disperse air fresheners, towels, and small bottles of armor-all...in case you are too lazy to go to AutoZone (which I am sometimes)  My favorite car wash moment:An unexpecting patron approaches "change" machine, in his attempt to get change for his 10 dollar bill, in which he plans to purchase the aforementioned green ever-green tree air freshener. He proceeds to insert said 10 bill  into machine. Clang...Clang.... like a slot machine in Vegas the change drops from the machine, as he reaches down he realized he just bought 10$ worth of wash tokens!  DOH!!!!He proceed to swear in Spanish..as his girlfriend laughs at him.  Little did he know that this Car Wash has it's own currency, and is a sovereign nation of the United States.....
other Our company held our fourth annual user conference here, and compared to our previous venues, this one was a smash hit in terms of facilities.  It compares particularly favorably with the doudy, sour old St. Francis in San Francisco, a venue I hope we never book again.The standout quality of this place is the hustle and quality of the service.  Our opening night reception included an array of food service stations with different themes, including a noodle bar that was particuarly well done.  The food was all delicious but what really distinguished this event was the personable, attentive, extra-mile oriented staff.  They were reading the nametags of our 200 guests and calling people by name whenever possible and chatting us up in line to make sure we were all happy.The event coordinators were all over the venue throughout the ensuing two days.  Where at the St. Francis we struggled with temperature and electrical problems and grumpy, uncooperative, disinterested staff, here at the Fairmont, the very few glitches drew aggressive responses by people who cared about our event.
other If you appreciate a good dive bar, you will love this place!  We came here for the first time when our team was playing in Glendale.  Dos Gringos played host to all BCS fans and it was a blast.  They have giant Jenga, dancing, multiple levels & bars and a great outdoor space. The facilities are a little beat, definitely a place where you don't want to touch anything in the bathroom, at least when it is packed.   The bar staff does a good job of managing the crowd and I never felt like I was wasting time begging for them to ask me what I wanted.We returned for a bachelorette party and although we still had a good time, I think this place really thrives when you are with a huge group.  Food is decent, but not why you come here.
other This place is for purists!  Be prepared for a great deal of questionable textured items if you order the tasting...Great sushi and sashimi however I would go to sakana sushi & grill for a true sashimi / sushi experience.
other Monday and Tuesday night after 8pm, you can get any bottle of wine and a whole board of bruschetta for $20. It's a steal, and a delicious one at that.
other I attended one of her classes for pressure cookers, and had to leave with one. Luckily, she offers great discounts after her classes!Since then I have also gotten a bosch mixer (don't know how I lived without one all these years!) and also a wheat grinder. Everytime I go in here I find something I can't live without!Shar has great classes, and tips on how to utilize all her products. Well worth it to attend a class. I just wish the store was closer to Glendale!So glad I found shar's, now my family enjoys homemade wheat bread and pizzas and all sorts of yummy things that are good for them too!
other Excellent atmosphere, eclectic menu, and reasonable prices. Welcome to The Parlor! Pizza seems to be their specialty but the menu offers so much more. Friends swear by the duck club sandwich, and my wife loves the sausage pizza. If you visit during peak times expect a wait, but head to the bar for a drink until your table is ready. Staff is super friendly- our server forgot to deliver apps we ordered and made it right by providing free apps (equal value) for our next visit. He was apologetic and owned up to the mistake (he simply forgot to add to computer) - it happens but he handled it well. I'll be back!
other I'm giving this one a other because I first ate at (and found out about) Lucilles at the Vegas location.  Over there it was spectacular - here its just amazing.  They give you so much food its unreal.  You can try anything BBQ you want or ever dreamed of.  You get these amazing biscuits with this butter stuff that is just like candy before the meal, and almost get full just with these.SO MUCH FOOD, go hungry and get ready to be amazed.  Some of the better BBQ in the area.  I look forward anytime I have the opportunity to visit a Lucilles.  Just can't wait till I go visit the Vegas one again!
other We loved this place.
3 Great place, well maintained. It's big airport with some long walks.
other I went here on a Saturday night and sat outside listening to the band playing in the background.  It was part of the Music Under the Stars, or whatever it called, very cool and fun though.  BTW, I see a lot of people commenting on how loud it was, to all you yelpers, take that with a grain of salt, it's a pizza place near a large family residential area on a weekend, what do you expect, I guess it's an expectation thing.  By no means is this going to be a quiet candlelit dinner for two.  It's a classy, family oriented pizza place. We ordered the caesar salad and small pepperoni pizza. Very well priced, and the pizza in my opinion tasted delicious.  It seems like everybody has some weird opinion on how good pizza is, and I guess I have a weird opinion as well.  Here goes...the size of the small, is not small it was more like a medium (value! winning!)(sorry lame Charlie Sheen pop culture reference) anyway, it had a faint sweet taste on it which i really like, the cheese was good, not too much sauce, and the pepperonis were very flavorful.  They were the small kind and they were just great.  The Salad was good, salad is salad, it's hard to mess that up.  We were helped by an awesome bartender/server named Chandler.  Cool guy, really nice, he kept us entertained.  We'll be back I want to try some kind of meatlovers next time we go there.
other Let's put it this way... I ordered two topping-heavy small pizzas from Naked Pizza.  I had a Groupon for $20 that only cost me $10.  So, keep in mind I am rating this on my entire experience that cost me merely $10 out of pocket.The good?  The garlic topping is delicious.  The employees were friendly.  They were generous with their toppings.    The bad? Daiya cheese is disgusting on this pizza and tasted like raw dough.  If you're off dairy, get the pizza sans cheese.  It will probably be a lot better!The just okay?  The crust was okay-tasting, if not a little plain and dry.  The sauce was pretty good for one of us and just okay for the other.  This is one of the two times in my life that I have ordered pizza and not kept the leftovers.  Of two adults and three kids eating the two small pizzas, we were left with one and a half 10" pizzas, which we promptly tossed in the bin.  My daughter disliked this pizza so much, she picked off a few of her toppings and then told me she was full (when she said earlier how famished she was).  I am only rating this pizza two stars versus one because I can see that it would be "better" without the Daiya cheese that I chose to have on the pizza instead of mozzarella.
other Family business bagel shops are my favorite.  I found this place through Groupon and decided to check it out.  The name itself intrigued me as Lox means salmon fillet that is cured.  I didn't go with salmon, but I got a honey wheat bagel with veggie lite cream cheese.  The cream cheese was freshly made with carrots, garlic, and celery.  It had a light taste to go with a healthy and hearty sized bagel.  My friends got croissants with cheese which tasted delicious as well.  The prices are very reasonable here and you can order bagels by the dozen.
other I hate for my first official review to be a one star review but Macayo's really disappointed me last night. When I first pulled into the parking lot last night I was surprised to see how many empty parking spaces there were. I immediately got excited because normally any restaurant on Bell road any night of the week has a wait. However, when I walked inside I saw a slew of people waiting to be seated. I walked up to the hostess stand and put my name on the list and the hostess did not give me a time quote and when I asked how long it would be she quoted me, "not too long." We waited about 1other minutes before being shown to our table which is where the trouble really began. Once we were at our table we were quickly greeted by our server (yay) however, she told us she had another table's drink order to get and then she would be back for ours (boo). So we waited for her to take the other two tables drink orders before coming back to take ours. After about 10 minutes we got our fountain drinks and then other minutes later she came back to take our food order. Then it took about 50 minutes for our food to come out. Seriously, 50 minutes.... that's about how long I planned to spend at Macayo's not how long I planned on waiting for my appetizer of taquitos to take to come out. And to top it off we were missing a side of rice and a side of baja sauce. We decided not to mention it as we did not want to wait another hour for the two items to come out. So, after eating and waiting for our drinks to be refilled 3 times we finally got the check to which the server apologized for our wait. Apparently, she couldn't have apologized at all during our 50 minute minute wait she needed to wait until tip time. I don't recommend going to Macayos. You might have better luck at any of the other 10 Mexican restaurants on Bell Road.
other Don't do business at this unethical business. My $2other savings account from 2009 was  recently stolen from $other a month for "account inactivity" fees. They are a bunch of crooks.It appears you now need to nickle and dime your customers with BS fees in order to stay in business. Account closed.
other we keep driving by this place thinking it was just a coffee house. but after reading some of yelps reviews, learned it was much more. it's so cute and trendy inside. they have so many yummy and healthy options, we didn't know what to pick. so we decided to go with the veggie breakfast burrito.it was light and filling, much to our surprise. and superbly tasty. and best of all, not gigantic. more places should do that....offer reasonably priced food, that tastes great, in manageable portions. that way, you don't stuff your face with a giant food plate and then feel like an obese slob the rest of the morning. we'll hit this place up again for sure. awesome staff too!!!!
other Well, if you want California fancy cuisine, this ain't your place.  If you are seeking down-home country cookin, this is your spot.  Anyway, there are no Cracker Barrels in California.  The lunches for the two of us were great.  Very good service on a busy day.  Our meals were exactly as ordered (many choices at Cracker Barrel) and the food was hot. The prices are unbelievably reasonable, as inexpensive as a fast food restaurant.The servers are super and extremely courteous and well trained.
other During my five-day stay in Tempe/Phoenix, I honestly did not have a single bad meal.  Every restaurant and coffee joint I stopped at gave me great experiences.  I wanted to end my trip out to Arizona with a good dinner, and I found myself at Dos Gringos to hopefully find that last meal out west.Honestly, the name sold me pretty quickly.  Obviously, I'm not going to expect fine cuisine and classy dining at a place called Dos Gringos, but being a fan of dives and being one with my fellow man, it sounded like a good place to experience.Despite it being chilly at night now this time of year, it was still an experience upon arrival.  It's like the tacky, somewhat tasteless, lampooned Mexican version of TGI Fridays, with a whole bunch of crap all over the walls, and a whole lot of hand-painted placards with sayings that make all of our inner-14-year-olds chuckle and appreciate.  The parking was free and plentiful, and I'm always a fan of the grungy, Christmas lights hanging all over the place kind of decor; my kind of style for relaxation and no-nonsense.There were TVs everywhere, which was nice to watch some Sunday Night Football in the process, and I sat wherever I pleased.  Service was from a cute petite blond waitress who was quick to take my order, deliver my beer, and bring my food when it was ready.  I ordered an enchilada, and two "street" tacos, which were corn tortilla apparently.  Don't take my word for it, being an uneducated in Mexican food, east coaster, but I thought it was great.  Definitely different than the kind of "Mexican" food I can get in Atlanta.Overall, I can't say that I had a bad experience.  The food was filling, not really expensive, and tasty to my tastebuds.  Beer, football on a mild evening in a place full of 56 pieces of tacky Mexican flair and a waitress with a great smile, and I can't complain.  Solid, adequate way to end my dining binging throughout the Phoenix/Tempe area.
other Been to the Spotted Donkey in Carefree multiple times and always been happy.  (can't speak to their new location on Hayden as we haven't been there yet).  The drinks are very good, if a bit pricy and the apps are wonderful.  Ordered the short stack of nachos, stuffed peppers and enchaladas this time.  All very good and tasty.  One note, everything seemed to be a bit "saucier" this time, especially the nachos.  While the sauce is very good and tasty with a good amount of spice, it was a bit mcuh for me.  I don't remember it being that way before so perhaps this was a fluke.Will definately be back
other went down to Scottsdale for Spring Training (Go Giants!) and we decided we wanted to have a nice, sit down meal instead of bar food or ballpark food every day/night.  Eddie's House fit the bill perfectly.Food - excellent.  Tuna Tartar "nachos" were great.  I had the scallops and they were perfectly cooked.  Also had a size of Fiddler's Ferns which I've only tried once before.  they were excellent.  Berry Cobbler for dessert also excellent.  Service - excellent.  very nice waiter who was very attentive.Location - close to downtown but not on the immediate Scottsdale Road path.  Atmosphere - also excellentPrices - being from San Francisco, the prices were unbelievably reasonable.
other I actually love the Waterfront Grill. I have never been there during bar hours, so it might not be a good later in the evening, but I usually go around 5-7 for dinner and the food has always been excellent. I usually get the buffalo chicken wrap, but sometimes I go with the fish tacos. Both are excellent and the service is great (because usually my and my friend are the only ones in there - I often wonders how it stays open). The cookie desert is awesome! It is like the Piezooki and Oregano's. Just as good.
other First let me say, that as a straight guy, I'm always a little apprehensive about going to gay bars for karaoke.  I know! I know! But my wife and I enjoy singing and have found it difficult to find places with decent sound systems that also have a decent catalogue of music, so I deal with it.  I've been to Kobalt twice now, the first time with my wife, and last night with a group of friends.  We had a lot of fun both times.  The music selection is one of the best we've found, although the sound system can be a little "off".  Sometimes the feedback can get a little strong on the wireless microphones.  I guess we're just spoiled by our regular karaoke haunt, and our hostess who mixes the music so you sound really good.  Here, it's just you and music baby!I have to say, the crowd at Kobalt is really different (in a good way) than some of the other bars in town.  The patrons are very friendly, and very respectful (well, everyone except for the guy that told our friend she was built like a "Brick Sh!thouse!"  I'm pretty sure he was just trying to tell her in his own way that she looked very lovely, which she did).  But seriously, that was a one-off and you get those in every crowd.   The bartender is really nice, very attentive, and remembered what we ordered from last week.  Huge props and huge tips!  The Karaoke host is great.  Works in new singers in a timely fashion and makes sure everyone has a good time.  There's been a lot of talk about the smell of popcorn in previous reviews.  It's true; they have a popcorn machine by the patio door.  I've never tried it, but there's only been crumbs left when we got there both times so I guess it goes good with beer, apple martini's or whatever your choice of drink may be. I didn't find the smell overwhelming though, as some have said.As for the catalogue, they have plenty to choose from.  You'll find a nice selection of country, rock, and of course...Showtunes!  You're almost guaranteed to hear Rent, Phantom, All that Jazz and plenty of old standards by Sinatra and the rest of the Pack.  FTW!It was a little difficult to find at first, but if you drive around to the North side of the building, you can park under the structure and you'll see the sign in the breezeway.  I give Kobalt other out of other stars only because they don't have karaoke on a night when I don't have to get up early for work the next morning.  If you're ever in the neighborhood, check it out!
other I am writing this review only for the optical department. I accidentally poked my eye with a branch yesterday and knew I had damaged it so I went to the Gilbert Costco optician and asked if I could be seeing on an emergency basis. The receptionist asked me if I could come back in other hours to which I stated it was an emergency and could asked the Dr if she could see me. She asked her and she said no she did not have time.I find it very unbelievable that on an emergency basis they can turn someone away who has a Costco optics patient for years. I recognize that she had a patient at the time but I said I could wait until after so she could at least take other minutes to tell me if I should go to a hospital or not. Dont ever waste your time going here if you need immediate attention for an emergency because they will not make room for you.
other When you go to a place called "Fajitas" you order the dang namesake! I've had all the different fajitas they offer and I love all them, my favorite is the shrimp it's lightly seasoned and grilled to perfection (side note: order the onions and pepper caramelized)! The tortillas are strong enough to fold without tearing yet still have a nice flavor. The toppings are always bright and fresh, the guacamole is legit. My coworker has talked me into always ordering a side of Queso with the free chips and salsa. Albeit the restaurant is old but the staff is super friendly and detail oriented. And yes, no matter what you order you will smell like fajitas so make sure you don't have anywhere special to go after eating here.
other I love Lulus cupcakes! They always have a perfect amount of frosting and alot of their cupcakes are better than the ones at sprinkles. This is because they seem to be moister and hold themselves together better. I love the raven! The Sales people are nice. So yummy! And I love that the place is pink!
3 Minnie and I stopped by Papago Dog Park today on a whim... It was a beautiful day and since she was such a good girl in the car with me and at my afternoon meeting, I wanted to reward her.  Rather than travel out of our way to go to Chaparral Dog Park (our usual dog park destination), I remembered seeing this place, specifically the fenced in / off-leash area, and we swung by.It was just after 4pm, and there were a handful of dogs there, and more were coming the longer we stayed.  It's a lot smaller than Chaparral, and the grass is not the healthiest I've seen... Unfortunately, there were several areas that owners didn't clean up after their pooches too.  (Come on, owners, you give the rest of us a bad name!)Anyways, we had a nice 30 minute visit... Minnie sniffed out a few other dogs from behind and then they returned the favor to her.  Don't you love how they socialize with each other?!  Too cute.Anyways, will this become our dog park of choice? No.Is this a viable option if you're in the area? 100%.
other My return trip to SaBai was excellent.I stopped in due to an irresistable craving for something with shrimp.  I was in a take out sort of mood, so as I sat at the bar the friendly owner gave me a glass of water with a cucumber slice in it.  I was pretty floored at how refreshing something so simple could be!I quickly got my order of Garlic Shrimp (extra spicy) and headed home.  The shrimp was perfectly cooked.  So perfect that I can't think of any other shrimp to compare it to.I was happy to see a decent crowd in the restaurant.  I know I'll be coming back again.
3 I like this mall.  It's in a decent location, there are lots of good stores, and the clientele here is bearable.  I've always thought of this mall as just below Scottsdale, but without all the silicone and snobbery.  We went last weekend to kill some time and were a little surprised to see that it was overrun with screaming toddlers.  I guess I should have known that when the AZ temperatures tip past 100 degrees, we have nothing better to do then hang out inside air conditioned malls or hang out inside air conditioned movie theatres, take your pick.  Anyway, the store selection is pretty good here, I just wish they would add a Crate and Barrel and a LUSH, then I would never have to visit Scottsdale again.
other What a place for brunch. $other drinks are fantastic. Their tenderloin egg Benedict and sea food sandwich is heavenly. Wish we had such a place in Los Angeles.
other After landing in PHX but before embarking on a 2.other hour drive to Flagstaff, i thought Wendy's would be a safe and easy place to grab some food on the go...well, I was wrong.* Chicken Nuggets: dry, freezer-burned meat with extra hard double-fried shell.* French Fries: super hot, crunchy, over-fried french-fry-shaped fry-shells. so hard and crunchy that i thought i was eating french-fry chips.* Junior Bacon Cheese Burger: bacon and burger meat both tasted dehydrated.Guess what, last thing I want after a 4hr flight and landing in 100+ weather is hot, dry, crunchy, tasteless food!
other I consider myself fortunate enough to have had a business lunch here a few weeks back. The food was excellent. Steak and potatoes just what a man wants! It was very well done and finished with a 3 berry cheesecake. Worth the moolah!
other I love the artwork.  Its a tiny little restaurant crammed with a bunch of little tables and chairs.  You go up to order at the counter, there's a salsa bar in the corner with a LOT of different salsas (most are not that great).  They do bring you the food and you do get a basket of chips on the house.  The tacos are pretty heft - about 3 bucks each.  They are "Gourmet tacos" after all..  All in all, its kind of uncomfortable service/restaurant wise (self serve) but the tacos are very good and you do get chips and a variety of salsas.  Not the most friendly staff and the cost is kind of high for a place like this but its pretty dang good.  Get it to go if you don't mind packing a bunch of salsa cups.
other Love it here. Come regularly now lol thanks to everyone on yelp. Great food cheap price great service. Tho not 100 percent authentic Chinese food still great
other everything, everyone has posted about this company is true! great service, friendly people, good pricing! highly recommend!
other I have heard so many good reviews for this place, so who wouldn't try it? I should have taken the hints before I got my meal, that this wasn't a good choice.Hint 1: Location - It's right next to a smoke shop and a gas station across the street from a mobile park.Hint 2: Food test - It was nice that I got to sample the food even if the first sample wasn't up to par, the guy wouldn't leave me alone about sampling.Hint 3: Decor - I know this should never have anything to do with the food, but it felt like I was eating at a cousins house on the bad side of town, wobbly chairs, wobbly table.I ordered the teriyaki chicken (didn't think it would be bad, I mean who can mess up teriyaki?) With chicken fried rice (once again, how on earth can you mess up fried rice?) The chicken tasted like it was frozen and thawed out all day. Such a horrible taste. The fried rice tasted like it too was thawed out, kind of had a gross tangy after taste. There also wasn't any spices or egg in the fried rice, just a bunch of green onion,which technically isn't a fried rice. This meal can be related to something you get in the frozen section at a grocery store.They also give you a snickerdoodle cookie, that looked like it could be the best thing on the menu, until I noticed it wasn't cooked all the way through.But the icing on the cake was the gross pube like grey hair I found floating in my teriyaki sauce. So the expensive $8 meal was so not worth it, and I 'm sure when Diners Drive Ins and Dives visited, the food was great, but today it was the grossest thing I've ever had.
other Terrible rolls. The Dragon was so so. The California was bland and the Spicy Tuna was cat food. Seriously, it  looked like canned cat food and tasted horrible.
other I can now thank the Humane Society for not only giving me my dog Brutus when I was a child, but now my dog Harley as an adult. A couple of years ago, I planned a visit to the Arizona Humane Society to present them with a corporate donation on behalf of my old company. When I scheduled the meeting, they offered to give me a tour of the vicinity and as a friend of the helpless animals, I said of course and planned my visit. However, I knew that with a tour, I might be in some trouble in the willpower department. When I arrived to the center, I was greeted by a pretty view of South Mountain and a wide open vicinity. I walked inside and immediately noted how clean it was for being home to many a furry creature. The staff was warm and welcoming as potential new "parents" waited in the lobby to adopt a new friend. Kittens and bunnies greeted the guests and there was a special area for the cats being featured that week. The vicinity was a five star facility to say the least and I could immediately tell that the animals were treated well here and in good hands until they found a new home. To make a long story shorter, they gave us a detailed tour of the complex. I walked through spacious room after spacious room full of dogs of all kinds just wanting a home. As I walked up to one of the cages, a furry ball of fluff looked up at me and placed his paw on the cage. I fell in love immediately. To make matters worse, the staff then took us into a room where we could make a kong of peanut butter and treats for our dog of choice. Of course I had to give it to my new found friend. At that point I knew I was in trouble and could very well be leaving with a dog. So to end that part of my story, I did leave with a dog and Harley has been happy in his new home ever sense. While I visited the Humane Society, I couldn't get over their quality of service for not only the clients but the animals themselves. They were clean, kept in spacious areas and they even had a huge playground for the animals to play in each and every day. When i found Harley and started to think about taking him home with me, they took me to a private play area where I could get to know Harley a bit more to make sure he was the right dog for me. A staffer stayed in the area and helped me with any questions I had. When I made the decision to take Harley home with me, they neutered him, gave me a couple free vet visits and sent me home with some treats, food and a leash. They even have a pet store to pick up all your essentials for your new friend. And did I mention that the proceeds go back to the Humane Society...a nonprofit? This Arizona Humane Society is a five star pet resort that focuses on making the most of a pet's stay until they find a new home. I suggest just taking a visit to the facility to see how well-kept it is. They even have horses that they rescued. Sorry folks, they are not up for adoption though. So thank you Arizona Humane Society for bringing my little dog Harley to me and saving so many animals from the streets.
other Though not the cleanest Denny's I've been to, the service is really nice so I'll keep coming back. The dirty that I'm referring to is in between the double-pane windows is soap film that makes it look like the windows are really dirty, but I know it really isn't on the inside of the restaurant.
other We were in AZ visiting out for Thanksgiving and really wanted so go AZ mexican food but had to go to a place with a full bar for some Margaritas.  This place came up on Yelp and looked interesting so we figured we would give it a try.  The food was pretty good.  My son had a cheese crisp, wife had beef enchiladas and a chicken taco, Mother-in-law had pork tamales, and I had the beef green chile.  They gave us to big baskets of chips and salsa (which we eat too much of!).  Everything was pretty good, but the margaritas were really good.  I always try the house first time I go someplace since I think it is a good judge of how good a place is and theirs did not disappoint.  I think they should advertise them more because they are so good.  Very fresh tasting!  Next time we go back to AZ we will definitely visit again.
other Just fantastic. I first went to Cornish Pasty in 05' a few months after they opened and fell in love immediately. Although a few things have changed over the years each one is usually an improvement and never a negative. If you are not familiar, a pasty is a traditional British coal miners food.  A hearty filling wrapped in a pie crust and baked. Kind of a hand-held meat pie. Cornish Pasty Co. has taken this simple and traditional dish and meticulously perfected each component. Their crusts are some how simultaneously hearty and flaky. Although their is nothing delicate about their seasoning it is never out of balance and all of the ingredients are always quality. Beyond just mastering the finer details of pasty science, Cornish Pasty Co. has also branched off into wild and exotic flavors. It's no shocker that the British know Indian food and it shows with the tika masala and the lamb vindaloo pasties. What is shocking is the refinement of the Greek and Italian inspired pasties. Perhaps my favorite pasty, from the cuisine most elusive to the British, is the Carne Avadado. This is a Mexican inspired pasty that will satisfy even the most snobby Las Cruses/El Paso foodie. If you have ever talked Mexican food with one you will know just what I mean. I have eaten nearly every item on the menu and not a one disappoints. It took me ages to get past the pasties and start ordering soups and salads. Now that I have had the spinach, mushroom, walnut soup, it is hart to save room for my old favorites. Although the mine shaft inspired interior is dark and cramped I have never felt uncomfortable there. The sound system is usually bumping classic rock and the employees are pierced and tattooed well beyond your typical wait staff, but everyone is friendly and service is typically good.If I have to list a negative the only one I can think of is the food is consistently just a little better at the University location than the Dobson one.  No clue why, but everyone I've talk to seems to agree, the Tempe store has the edge on quality.  After you add a respectable selection of beers the only reason you won't be here every night is your waist line.
3 Chino is a cool place to take someone who has never been there before.  It's strange and fascinating.  I live fairly close by and the food is fine, but it certainly doesn't blow your mind.  It's the kind of place that I get that Chino craving then I don't need to go for another 6 months or a year.  The snickerdoodles are great and come with the meal.  Expect to pay close to $10 a person if you get a drink with your meal.
other Love this place!  Been going to this location for years.  The food is always great and the price isn't too bad either.  The only thing I would say is a con is the service.  You never know what kind of mood the server will be in or if they will be attentive or not.  This place is delicious if you're looking for steak, or seafood, burgers, etc.
3 The food isn't all that. I order an Ahi Salad, which was barely touched. On the other hand, the chicken Popsicle my friends ordered were quite delightful. all in all, that atmosphere was surely enjoyable.
3 I have either an extreme LOVE or DISLIKE for this place. More love, though. Things I love: Great wine, with all different price points, which is nice. Cool, speakeasy atmosphere. Great bands and entertainment. Great cheese platter and flat breads. Good prices. Things I do not love: Service. Are you a bouncer? A bartender? Are you leading me to a seat? can you get me a seat? Its confusing. The staff is not clearly defined (not only do they not wear uniforms, or name tags, but they are scarce and hard to find) The mix. It is kind of a random mix. I guess that can be a good thing, but I was there once and it was like Spring Break in Cabo, and then the other time, it was like 50+ snow birds day. Either one is fine, it is just hard to gage when to go and who to bring, like, my mom, or my pals. They serve dessert, but no coffee. That, to me, is just strange. Buy a coffee maker. Sheesh. They have this amazing fondue that would be great with some baileys and coffee, and alas, no coffee. Strange. I know, "wine bar", but if you serve dessert, coffee should go hand in hand. In the end, the place is cool and they have some of the best entertainment there. they ambiance is nice. Go early for a seat, they are hard to come by. Beware of paying $ at the door for an entertainment fee, but it is well worth it.
other I had an awesome experience here and highly recommend Dr. Dachs. He is here to be a good dentist, not just to get rich. His hygienist was a rock star: So nice and very gentle. I nearly fell asleep during the cleaning.I found my way to this practice after a horrible experience at another dentist just half a mile away (see my review of Belmont Dentistry on Raintree). Dr. Dachs was just so helpful and reassuring while still maintaining a very high level of professionalism. I am very thankful that my "second opinion" quest led me to him. I now finally have a top-quality dentist in Scottsdale I can trust!I definitely recommend selecting this practice. It may take a little time to get in, but it's worth it. They also work well with insurance.
other Sportsman's is on top of the game when it comes to wine! The staff is more knowledgeable and helpful than any other place that I have bought wine at before. I didn't feel like I was being judged for trying to find a cheaper bottle and there was no pretentiousness in the air. While I was inquiring about dry resling, one of the vino gurus offered to get me a taste of one from their bar - and came back with TWO samples for me to try! Sportsman's also has a very intriguing liquor section - I enjoy wandering around and looking at all the fabulous bottles I have never seen nor heard of. Several times a month, they offer complimentary wine tastings and special discounts on most of the bottles being sampled.  They also have a full service restaurant/bar off to the side where they have a huge "by the glass" list - you are also welcome to pick out any bottle from their store, they cork it free of charge, and you can enjoy your retail priced bottle with dinner!  The portabello sliders that I had for dinner were amazing and I am still having dreams about them! My one complaint is petty: their website.  Its overrun with text and finding important information is difficult, it also needs to be better updated with their amazing tasting events!
other A hole in the wall in South Phoenix.... I order: The "Betty Boop" - a plate with other waffle and other fried chicken breast.  Add a huge mason jar of the sweetest & reddest Koolaid (or Sweet Tea - depending on my mood) and a side of grits drowning in melted butter and I'm a happy girl.Their Red Velvet Cake is also amazing. I know fried chicken and waffles seem like an odd combination but it's really interesting and satisfying - with the syrup and hot sauce for the chicken.... Yum Yum.  It's one of my family's favorites!!!  TRY IT!!!!
other Tasty Thai- is. But it could also be called Delicious Thai. And the service is always great!
other Love.  It.  Awesome pulled pork, brisket, turkey.  The sides are really good, too.  I feel like it's somewhat expensive, but it's worth every bite, but then again, that's BBQ.  If it's dirt cheap, that means it's not quality meat.Anyway, the 2-pound potato is great, too -- chives, sour cream, butter....
other Ahhh, Four Peaks.  By far my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.  This place is fantastic as far as brew pubs go - great beer and great food to go with it.  I can't believe I haven't taken the time to review it yet...The Beer: pretty consistently awesome.  All the beers are at least "good," my favorites being 8th Street Ale and their IPAs (Hop Knot and Raj).  I have to say the Kiltlifter is a tad overrated, but still pretty solid, and worth a try.  I've been meaning to try one of their cask conditioned ales, but they always seem to be out, probably indicative of the quality of those selections.The Food: fantastic!  I can't say that I've ever had a bad meal at Four Peaks.  The Italian Beef Beer Bread is the best thing on the menu, but you can't go wrong with the Chicken Fingers, Chicken Salad Pita, or really any of their sandwiches.  The fries are also great here - there's a little crispy coating on the outside that is quite tasty.  Oh, and the Spicy Thai Hummus is also a really good appetizer.  A little more liquidy than your average hummus, but really good.  It has a nice little kick to it that will have you reaching for your beer.Bottom line, if you live in Phoenix, like beer, and enjoy eating a good meal, then you should be shot if you don't like Four Peaks.  If you haven't been yet, do yourself a favor and try it.  You'll come away happy, I promise.
other we visited on april 15th and And also Sunday April 22..I have twice now gone to your restaurant and twice been told that I couldnt use my BOGO coupon. The first time my mother went to pick up our order, she was told we didnt order the right food and we had to order off the main entress. The second time we ordered, I was told that we had to order off of the DINER SELECT menu. I did not have my coupon handy, and when I was able to read it, it says specifically, "Offer valid for one complimentary Diner Select with the purchase of another entree. Complimentary Diner Select must be of equal or lesser value to purchase entree. Valid entrees include SIGNATURE DISHES, BOWLS, SALADS, DINER SELECTS AND LETTUCE WRAPS." So why, on two separate occasions were we told conflicting information and not allowed to use the coupon, thus spending a small fortune on food, TWICE?!?!? Your customer service is far from what it used to be and I doubt you will be getting more of our business any time in the near future.
other This place just has a really good happy hour. I usually just stick to appetizers when I go but with free chips and salsa all night, I don't need much more. Their happy hour goes from 3:00 to 7:30, fantastic considering happy hours seem to be ending earlier and earlier now a days. There are plenty of HDTV's around to keep me entertained, so I'm gonna guess it gets really busy on Sundays during football. This is just a good place for pretty cheap drinks and decent Mexican food.
3 First I want to thank Hula for saving my date night.  We headed out for Postino Central for their wine and bruchetta special on a Tuesday and were disappointed to find out there was an hour wait.   So we headed up central looking for an alternative. I saw Hula and remembered I've wanted to try it for while, so that's where we ended up.  I started with a blood orange martini and sweet potato fries.  The martini was awesome, but I have to say the fries had potential, but they weren't crispy.  For dinner I had the Jamaican jerk tofu.  It was pretty flavorful and the corn cakes and plantains that came with it were a nice addition.   The meal was good, the service was great and the overall ambiance was chill yet urbane.  It wasn't the best place I've ever been, but I'll definitely go back. I love that there are several vegetarian options to choose from, so I'm eager to see how the other entrees turn out with tofu.
3 Simple, Inexpensive and within walking distance from my place. I went biking this evening and had the sudden urge to get Chinese food.I ordered something to go and got a vegetarian dish with tofu. From what I've observed, the place is simple and clean. Now as far as my dish goes; I thought it was good, but needed more flavor.  (which is a good thing)It gave me a good reason to infuse my dish with Bragg's Liquid Amino which is healthier than other seasonings. My only complaint is the edename in the vegetarian dish. Why do they have to include the shell? I don't like unwrapping them with my teeth!  ;-P                 |                 |  /                 | /   . .~^(,&|/o.      "Pass the soy sauce please!" |   `----------  |  \                  /   `======='
other I have driven past this place a million times and never stopped, so today I did.I basically was in an overpriced Subaway called Port of subs. The sub was ok, nothing special. They do not have a good variety of bread choices and none of their subs really sounded that good. I was SUPer starving, if I wasn't I probally would have left and ate somewhere else.The staff was very nice and the place was clean. I do think I will eat there again.
other Really great burgers...I would hope so with a name like Smashburger. This location is really good, so it gets busy at lunch time. Waiting is a bit of a pain, but it's typically not too long. The food takes a few minutes too, which is a positive in my book. The food here feels a lot fresher and better than fast food, though if you've seen their burgers, it's not a place that's super healthy.They also offer chicken sandwiches (crispy or grilled), and salads, so there are some healthier options, but the winners here are the burgers and fries. Definitely try the smash fries. Tossed in olive oil, garlic and rosemary, they are delicious. Burgers are really good and juicy, and the ingredients they use seem fresh.Cons are the long lines, and it's also not a place where you'll be in and out in 1other minutes. It's also not inexpensive. A burger, fries and a drink will run you $10-11, which seems high for "fast food", though I think it's worth it. What's nice though, is that you sit down with your number and they bring you your food, and they'll bus your table, so it feels like a combo of fast and full service...I suppose this is a perfect example of "fast casual". It's pretty close to my office, so I'll be back often. Definitely worth a try if you're in the area and craving a burger.
other I've been a Da Vang devotee for years and wanted to try a new Vietnamese place tonight and Pho Thanh didn't fall short. In fact, I think I might like this place a little better than Da Vang, but I'll rotate between the two since they're both so good.First off, the portions are gigantic! The Bun bowl could easily serve two and I had tons of leftovers for lunch tomorrow. They use the fat rice noodles instead of the vermicelli, but I think it made the dish a little heartier and certainly easier to eat with chopsticks.Hubby had the Pho and the broth was amazing! Savory, a little salty, and the spices were perfect. Perfect to warm your bones on a rainy day.The restaurant was more of a cafe style than family sit down, but exceptionally clean and the service was great. There was quite a diverse crowd in there for a Sunday night and everyone's dishes looked fantastic.
other "Yogurtland" as I say it with a high-pitched tone in the end..This is my ultimate favorite dessert!! I would give 10 stars if Yelp allows it! All my friends know that I am attached to this place! We started this craziness together with my better half when we tried it a few years back after a basketball game...and all I said after first walking in was, "This is fun!!" and we got hooked eversince!! That I collect their spoons, only used by me and the hubbie, and I now have other YGL  cups full of spoons!! I am the ultimate Yogurtland addict!! heehee We go as often as other times a week that we already know the staff in this location. And we go that often that we even tried to abstain from it for Lent just to see if we can resist it!! haha Most of our friends also keep on asking to try other fro yo places to see if something will beat my YGL addiction..and so far nothing has won over it yet..=DSo, my favorite flavors are Taro, Pistachio and Toasted Coconut and the of course the seasonal flavors, Pumpkin Pie, Gingerbread..Oh I wanna go now just thinking about it! My favorite toppings are the yogurt chips, sugar cone, sunflower seeds, shredded coconut and graham!!  =) Perfect blend of flavors! So if you haven't tried it yet, grab your favorite partner and enjoy some "Yogurtland"...=)
other Eh -- no. I stopped here for quick take-out one day while at work. They had no sushi at all (even though it's on the menu), and the menu itself isn't laid out very well for understanding what they have/what's included.  I wasn't there to eat onsite, but good thing -- very little inside seating.  The food wasn't all that good, and if the customer says "to go", then you should put utensils and napkins in the bag for me. The place didn't seem very clean either. Just not a good experience. Go somewhere else.
other Atmosphere good.  Food...not so much.  I recently ate here for the first time and, unfortunately, I can't say anything good about the food.  I ordered a chicken shwarma sandwich and expected a hot middle eastern sandwich filled with flavorful chicken sauteed with onions and spices and accompanied with crisp fresh veggies.  What I got was FAR from what I expected.  The pita bread was your typical crappy faux Wendy's style doughy flat bread 'pita', not a regular pita pocket.  Inside was some flavorless, cold, unseasoned chicken (and when I say flavorless I mean indistinguisable from a mouthful of cardboard).  They didn't even bother to put basic salt and pepper on this sorry meat.  The remainder of the sandwich consisted of raw zuchinni (WTF?!), chopped tomatoes, 3 leaves of romaine lettuce, and some bits of red onion.  None of the veggies had been dressed or seasoned.  Oh, there was also some hummus/tahini 'sauce' mixed in there (presumably for flavor), but I have never tasted anything so flavorless.  I imagine that wall spackle has more flavor and pizazz than this 'sauce'.  Come on Paisley, does your cook even TASTE what comes out of the kitchen?  Add some flavor to your food.  You could start with salt, fresh lemon juice, garlic, pepper, and high quality olive oil.  It's really not that hard.
other This place rocks!!  We bought 750 sq ft of tile a few months ago to install on our own and we had no idea what we were doing.  They helped us every step of the way. We made several visits over the course of about 3 months and everyone we talked to was helpful and knowledgable. I will absolutely go back when we re-do the floors in the rest of the house.And the prices are the best.  I am a bargain shopper and will research prices for months before making a large purchase and that is exactly what I did when we embarked on this project.  I researched prices all over... online, in stores, with contractors, etc and Floor and Decor by far had the best prices.  The entire floor cost less than $1500 in tile, materials, and tools. It looks beautiful and I couldn't be happier!
other It was early on a Saturday, was greeted warmly by the bartender, who was the only person serving the smallish bar area. We dat ourselves and were quickly met for our drink order, beers were other bucks for 26oz drafts (nice!) my partner ordered the pizza, it was hot and pretty fresh tasting, I had the waitress order me whatever she wanted! I like doing this from time to time to see their knowledge of the menu. Good food and a fun place to watch the game....
other I never knew green chilies were more valuable than gold. We ordered a dozen red tamales and a dozen green chilies. The person taking our order was not happy that we did not give them a 2other hour notice that their "gourmet tamales" require for such a large order. The red tamales were as dry as sawdust and the green chilies came with one small sliver of chili. The "hot Sauce" they have is nothing more than enchilada sauce with red chili flake added. Next time I'll just go to Del Taco where two dozen .40 cent tacos do not require a 2other hr notice from a family of 6.
other My previous review has the real details about what i LOVE about their food!Update:  Doing mostly take-out here, but at least one of the grumpy girls is more friendly now!  Yesterday when I grabbed our to-go order, she smiled, made small conversation, and did not exude a sullen disposition in any way.  I'm happy for me, I'm happy for her!Ordered many of our usual items, plus Mongolian beef, which was very tasty. I'm stil partial to the Ginger beef, however.
3 It was a little expensive.  $65.80 for two apps, one drink, two sodas, two entrees, and one shared dessert.Highlights:The Grilled Wings were very good.   Nice and crisp, charred but not burned, and not too fatty.  I could have eaten two dozen of them.The Cheddar Potatoes were a hit at the table, liked by all.The Creme Brulee was excellent, and about twice the size that Torched Goodness offers, for other cents less than TG charges.Lowlights:The hummus was just plain, and there was something else they put on top of it, something a little bitter - ??  Not sure what it was, but it was not impressive.The "half rack" of ribs were pretty tiny for $14.95.  Not a lot of meat.The Flatiron Steak was also tiny, and overcooked.  Not very tasty at all.Mashed potatoes and Mac-N-Cheese were very pedestrian.All in all, I might go back, have other orders of the wings app, and finish with Creme Brulee.  But I won't go with the kids again, not for $7other with tip.  We could have eaten 3 times at Los Taquitos for that price.
3 Agree with most posters about the setup - left much to be desired.I was smart and arrived BEFORE 4:00 P.M. so I could jump in early for some short and FAST lines.  My 15-yr-old son was with me, and he's a fairly picky eater, which was one reason I brought him - so he could see that there are other foods he might like if he TRIED them.I got a lot of food between 4:00 and 4:30, when the lines were short.  I probably got to try 10 trucks before we left at 5:07.  We went back to some trucks more than twice or three times when we found something we liked.My advice for future events:1.  Help the trucks deliver the samples FASTER.  Not sure how - maybe get them an extra staff member?  But the samples on some trucks were coming SLOWLY, so that needs to improve.2.  Better location, maybe not on dirt, and maybe a little larger.  Once the lines got up to 20-30 people, the going was CRAMPED and it was taking a long time to get your samples.3.  Maybe a lower price for tickets?  Seemed kinda steep for the amount of food each person received.All in all, I enjoyed the FOOD, but the rest of the logistics, not so much.
other I went to this place with a family member upon their recommendation.  The salad was amazing!  I forget exactly what it is called (cowboy chopped salad I think?) .  Firstly it's gorgeous (comes in rows of the ingredients which are beautiful colors; arugula, tomatoes, pepitas, dried currents, chicken, asiago cheese, and dried corn for some crunch)  Then when it gets to your table they pour on the dress (a creamy dressing with a slight basil taste to it), and it all gets mixed together.  I believe it usually comes with salmon instead of chicken but we ordered ours with chicken and it was a great fit, I highly suggest it. The rest of the menu looked amazing too, but I'm not sure I could go there and not get the salad.  So I suggest going with multiple people, splitting the salad and then splitting another entree.  The decor of the place could probably use a little sprucing up and it's a bit on the cheesy side.  Service wise was unfortunately not the greatest experience.  It was a slow time and we had a hard time getting our bill or being asked if we needed anything else.  Thus the deduction of a star.  But I would still give it another try just for the food.
other Excellent macaroons!  Great owners very conversant with their costumers.
other Seriously soo good! Drove 60miles to come here about other times in the 3 months that I lived in AZ. I came here because of the triple D episode and it was soo worth it! Burgers, fries, onion rings, sweet potatoe fries and pizza are ALL GOOD! and check out their bathrooms.. its pretty cool too. Tried Joe's Real BBQ, which is their first restaurant but it was just OK. Joe's Farm grill is def. one of my fav places..
other My nephew just moved to Scottsdale recently so me and a bunch of friends brought him here to show him a local bar that he and the girlfriend could come shoot pool, watch football, play volleyball etc...well....we weren't there 5minutes and other kids were running around the pool tables, messing up our games and screaming. I couldn't believe the staff was allowing this to happen. They were hitting the pool sticks on everything and crying when their mom attempted (in vain) to quiet them. You'd think the mom would leave at this point with her  kids....um...no....the staff did seem annoyed as well but said nothing. Then....it happened...she said " you guys better behave or mommy will be fired"!! Holy shit....she works there!! Even worse! Shame on that owner for allowing this to happen. And that employee needs to recognize this...YOU WORK AT A BAR.....not a daycare....A BAR!!!
other Yum!  The toasted barley app is delicious. My boyfriend and I shared the eggplant sandwich and the monk burger. Both of the sandwiches were outstanding. The service was great too. We will definitely go back.
other Lets just say i was not to please with my experience at Nails R Us. After two days my nails were lifting on about other nails by the end of the weekend i had 6 nails lifting, so i went back and showed them and she was like its normal. No it normal to lift but not after other days! They did fix them for me free of charge but were very rude to me!!! Will not be going back there or will not refer any of my friends there!
other Sauce is my kind of place.  Great, inexpensive food, casual yet trendy atmosphere, perfect location.  Located right by Urban Outfitters and Olive and Ivy at the Scottsdale Waterfront, I like Sauce as a pre or post shopping bonanza meal.  I always have the same thing: the mozzarella and tomato salad (which you should know is mostly greens with chucks of each, drizzled in balsamic), and the artichoke and portabella pizza.  This is a huge meal so I always have leftovers which make for the perfect 2am after-bar treat.  If youre feeling particularly saucey, you can have yourself a glass of wine as well.
other Who doesn't love $3 well drinks? Relaxed, social, no frickin' paid seating!! Except that I was propositioned to " Swing" by some totally gross dude, I Lovd this place to start the evenings!!! Great cheap drinks.  What more do you need?
other I had just been to the Chandler Deseret location and didn't realize the there was a second store nearby.  This too is wonderful bookstore (though smaller then Chandler) where you can purchase both Christian and LDS items.The only drawback to this location is there is no Lion House Pantry.Being a non-Mormon, I've found the staff both friendly and helpful and have never been proselytized.  Since I do have several Mormon friends,  I've found the Deseret Bookstore a good place to go to purchase hard to find Holiday gifts.Enjoy!
other I LOVE LIFE TIME!!  It's always clean  plenty of machines to work out  on  that are in working order!  HUGH VARIETY  of classes to take and keep you from getting bored.  My kids LOVE it too and ask when we are going to the gym.  They also have the rock climbing wall, basketball and Squash courts and outdoor and indoor pool with life guard and a water slide at both.  The out doors  and indoors have a lap pool as well .  The inside has other extra large jacuzzi  and of course your steam room and saunas. I personally love the locker rooms they are so nice to shower and get ready in they provide everything you could think of ( just like a other star hotel!! )  This place keeps me motivated You Gotta try the Zumba class and Strictly strength class!!!
other How could you not love this place?  Not only is the food fantastic and consistent, it has a great atmosphere and an adorable "grocery" shop next door.  It's a great place to people watch!  (Don't forget to check out the wine section--not only is the wine random, it's affordable and a great conversation starter with all the cute names and labels)After moving here from San Diego, I've been so unimpressed by all the breakfast spots in Phoenix.  This is the one place that I LOVE!  I think it offers something for everyone, however my go to is the Venice Beach Burrito.  It's such a casual spot--you order from the counter, find a table, and wait for them to call you to let you know your food is ready to be devoured.  There's tables both inside and out, and you can peruse the store while your stomach rumbles!The only thing I've ever been disappointed by is the sangria, but then again I'm not a huge fan of white sangria.  I will not be ordering it again but I have girlfriends that love it.I had never been here for lunch until this past weekend--it was always my late morning brunch spot.  Technically, I believe its a pizza place, but I've never had a pizza.  Although, they look quite good!  I ordered their tuna sandwich this past weekend, which came with a side of fruit and pickles.  The bread was thin and grilled panini style, and the tuna salad definitely did not disappoint!
other I think this is the best frozen yogurt I've ever had. Even better than Golden Spoon, which is saying a lot cuz I love that place. I tried the peanut butter, triple chocolate (not my personal fav but my coworker loved it), cake batter (to die for), strawberry (tastes like a strawberry malt), snickerdoodle, and prailine. They have the best toppings of any yogurt shops I've visited. Favorites include choc chip cookie dough, mini gummi bears, mochi, yogurt chips, cheesecake, and boba... not to overlook the fresh fruit....
other This is an adorable little gallery located in the middle of nowhere, Downtown Phoenix.  My art teacher friend got fixated on bringing me here when she heard me complaining about Phoenix being chain hell (and thanks to her and Yelp, I don't believe that anymore).  I think she chose wisely as I loved this little space.  It was a nice place to stop and check out, and then of course we had lunch at the attached City Bakery.  A perfect activity for a half-day of school!  Hooray creativity and uniqueness!
other Grab a cup, grab an outdoor chair, enjoy the show!
other I had received an email from a student retention telling me that I still owe money for the time that I had taken classes (two weeks) although these fools canceled my financial aid. I will sue this school if they even attempt to collect money from me and I have withdrawn from the classes on the right time, but this rep. told me that the withdrawal period was Jan. 11.
other I can only vouch for the chicken salad, as it's the only thing I've ever tried in the 20 years I've been coming here. It's THAT good. I always think about trying something else, but why mess with perfection?Walking inside gives you the sense that you've stepped into a time machine and arrived in the late 70's. I, personally, find it to be awesome. Most of Scottsdale is lacking in historic flare. And yes, the late 70s is historic by Scottsdale standards. Besides, whatever money they're not spending on updating the decor is clearly going right into their magically delicious chicken salad.
other Best prices in Phoenix nice ladies,   will do exactly what you ask with your hair
other This place is an experience.  I can't stop thinking about it!!!  I love the weird odd flavors (Basil Lime?)  and everything tastes so fresh and organic.  It's nice to have something like this close by our house!  A true guilty pleasure.
other The bar and wait staff couldn't be better at this location of PF Chang's.  The food and service is better than any other 'Chang's' country-wide.  We just moved here from NY and missed our "local hangout".  The bar tenders and wait staff have made us feel at home.  We go at least once per week for wonder food, drink, and company with the staff and other patrons.  Thank you Clint, Gerry, Nate, Kyle, Nick, Angie, et al.
other This is Mesa's best breakfast, hands down! This is one of my family's favorite Saturday/Sunday brunch places in the valley. Crackers & Co. is great food at great prices and we always take out-of-town guests there when visiting!I was never a fan of eggs unless they were scrambled or in an omelette, but Crackers showed me the way to delicious fried and poached eggs!  The Eggs Benny is great, both Traditional and California-style. Their omelettes are huge and never overcooked (my fave: Spinach Mushroom) . The skillets are mighty tasty and really satisfying (my fave: The Vatican with eggs over easy). Try their French toast... it's got great flavor and is delightfully crispy. If you get a chance, try lunch there! Their soups are so scrumptious and the sandwiches are to die for! The Cream of Spinach and Artichoke soup tastes just like a bowl of spinach and artichoke dip, and they don't skimp on the artichokes at all! The Chicken Dumpling soup is seriously the best I've ever had (I'm not even a fan of dumplings!)! The Roma Tomato Chicken Melt is my favorite sandwich on the menu (such good flavor!), followed closely by the Drunken Chicken sandwich. Their burgers are quite good and along with their salads, they serve up a hefty portion!Beware though of 30 to 4other minute wait times on the weekends in the winter due to snowbirds flocking for breakfast. The wait times let up about 12:30P though, so it's great for those who can't decide between breakfast or lunch!
other Machaca Burro is ridiculous and the butter tortilla will take you to the promised land
other I love boba drinks but hate the word "boba". I always feel like an ape when I say that word.  Anyways.There was a period where I use to drink this stuff at least 3 times a week when I was living in San Francisco, so when I say I love something, I really do (or is it more like a creepy obsession?) So! When I found a boba place here I got excited, especially when I saw that they had green milk tea.I can't vouch for all of their drinks, as I've only tried the green milk tea and avocado snow, but every time I have ordered them they have been super good.
other I come here about other or other times a year. It's consistently good. There is ample seating, so I've never waited long. It's off Central, so the parking is horrid. Their lot holds a good number, but it can be tricky to get in and out when crowded - I don't drive my van here.  I am always pleased with the food. I find the salads ok - I really like their Balsalmic Vinigarette dressing - I'll mop the leftover with bread. I typically get spaghetti with meat sauce and sausage. The sauce has a good flavor. The Brown Butter with Mizithra Cheese is incredible - but very rich.  The staff is always courteous, and I rarely have to wait for anything.
other GREAT PLACE TO HANG OUT AND WATCH THE SCENERYWith a little help you can drink & choose from about 2other beers, 8 scothes,10 whiskeys,8 Really good tequila's (just ask me) along with the every day vodka's & some pretty impresive wines (or whines).Don't miss this little gem in the rough & com listen to music or watch sports or just drink. Oh yea the owners are OK also
3 Pricey!!  Not my fave place to shop for vintage wares but decent to peak through.
other They are helpful there and they are not helpful there, depends on how busy it is.  The place can be mobbed by rich teenagers and trendy asians, but if you have a warranty and need help, and you have an appointment then you are fine.  I have to admit having an macbook pro and an !phone, I am always drawn in.  But the skinny crew with their cool black apple shirts can be quite helpful if you really need it.  It is hard to resist not going in.  The tech people really know their stuff.  I do wish another Apple store would open up in the West valley though.
other The pizza is my favorite in Phoenix.  It is light, airy and tasty and does not give you that "I am reading to explode as my cotton mouth is making me drink two liters of water every half hour" feeling.The ingredients are fresh and delicious.  I am hooked!
other I have been living in Arizona for other years and have yet to find a decent Italian Beef Sandwich, until now.  I even gave the same statement to the owner.  I had ordered an Italian Beef for carry out, and while I was waiting, I let him know my frustrations.  He gave me his card and told me to call him after I ate the sandwich because he wanted to know what I thought.  Well, it was FANTASTIC!  Of course, I called him back to let him know.  The service, and the time and effort put into the food cannot be beat.  This is what you get for a mom and pops type place.  There are plenty of other sandwiches and foods there too.  I can't wait to go back and try some more!
other Not impressed. The young lady behind the counter aked like she could care less about my 1other shirts I had to drop off. I had used them before and nobody ever smiles at you. When I asked about pricing and how they protect shrinkage she said " we can't guarantee anything". Well, I can guarantee I will be goping elsewhere. You would think based on how expensive they are that they would care more.
3 Narcisse couldn't be more appropriately named...another Scottsdale scene club with a lively but predictable crowd of scantily dressed cougars, Middle Eastern royalty and upscale business folk. The music is hoppin and thumpin late and leans toward House, which is why I added two stars. We actually entered by taking an elevator up and walking through a kitchen in rather cinematic style, emerging right onto the dance floor, which was packed. I guess it pays to know someone. The champagne selection is outrageous here and packed though it was, our drinks arrived in seconds. The sky-high patio is a nice place to chill and check out the little skyline, but it's all about getting your dance on here. I would like to check it out for happy hour when fewer people are bumping into you and stepping on your feet. The Russian mobster-channeling bouncers are a little intimidating, but treated us well. An uber enthusiastic dancer knocked into my friend and shattered her Veuve glass, and all was whisked and mopped in seconds. The music sure beats the tired 90s cover bands that seem to be epidemic in this area.
other Awesome subs clean and friendly well priced.
other After SMOCA opening night, I just wanted to relax with some friends and not go get wasted or have to wait a long time to get a seat at a trendy bar on a Friday night. Oh yeah, and get something to eat. I had remembered some generally good reviews of Drift, had noticed it when going to shows at Martini Ranch, and really wanted something with coconut (?).After a terrifying short-cut with a walking GPS that I was sure was leading us to our death (or at least led us to dog-shit on the sidewalk at one point), we ended up here with a nice enough door guy. Inside I was really impressed. It was a lot nicer than I thought it would be, more sophisticated and while it was Tiki-themed, I thought it was very tongue in cheek COOL interpretation of tiki (very hard to pull off). We asked for a booth and got one near the door (which lead to superior people watching later). Our booth was creamy, spacious, left us with no ass swamp, (although the acoustics were a little bad-I had trouble hearing someone two people away) and showed us more intimate tables in very Ikea-esqe and mod black leather. This place is surprisingly classy. The giant aquarium at the bar was goregous and if I ended up here with one other person, I would def. sit there.Our waitstaff was extremely sweet, the food (veggie spring rolls, coconut shrimp, and pot stickers) were not that expensive (5-8) and surprisingly good. Kristin and I got two orders of spring rolls. We took the longest time deciding drinks-I got the old fashioned Pina Colada in a coconut shell (YUM) and Erica got the Evil Bastard which was set on fire and it was damn potent. I was very giggly the rest of the night. Looking around, this WAS not a pick up scence. Groups of friends just sat around chatting. On the way to the bathrooms, a small open lounge was dominated by one party having a lot of fun. The bathroom sink blew my mind and I still don't know what sets it off...although my theory is some dude needs to flush the toilet for water to come down and vice versa. I started freaking out in my drunky state, saying "I have soapy hands goddamit! And I'm smart! How does this shit turn on!" wiping my hands on the sink with tiny amounts of water.Overall, a very chill scene with a bizarre assortment of people (bro dogs, homely couples, musicians, barbies, and just regular folks) perfect for a second or third date for a casually romantic drink or two.
other After finishing a round of golf at Wildfire, we came in for lunch since the restaurant had been closed for dinner since December 17th and was reopening on the 25th. I dined here several years ago for dinner and really enjoyed the dinning experience. My order - the 8oz sirloin steak with garlic fries and an ice cold beer. My steak was cooked perfectly and the dipping sauce and garlic fries were yummy too! I love the decor of the place, it's part golf theme in the bar area but the dinning area is definitely Western elegance decorated. I'll surely return here in the future but next time it will be for dinner!
other I traveled to Phoenix often for work from the early 90's to the late 00's and the first thing I'd do leaving the airport was to hit the Pink Pepper lunch buffet, hence I've never ordered from the menu or had their dinner service, but their lunch buffet was awesome!  Very reasonably priced, including an iced tea.  It may not necessarily be the most authentic Thai food as I think they reduce the heat a bit but the flavors were excellent and the variety was good.  Loved their eggplant dish (can't recall the name) and their crispy chicken with the creamy sauce, and of course the usual curry sauce dishes.If I'm ever back in Phoenix again the Pink Pepper will be one of the first places I go.
other I can't think of a better Thai rest. In PHX. Consistently good food and service.  They have Thai staples like rice paper rolls, Tom Ka Gai and Pad Thai as well as more creative items such as Crispy Mango Fish. Average Thai food pricing, free parking.  There are a good number of tables, so don't let a short line dissuade you.  Like any rest., scope your table before you sit to be sure it suits your mood.  Boisterous din in the main room when busy.
other I just cannot understand why this place is so highly rated. Could it be that people have never experienced barbeque outside of Arizona, so they have no basis of comparison? But even that cannot be true. We have Joe's in Gilbert, and even Famous Dave's is pretty darn good. I work a block from this location, so I have been there at least a dozen times. While not great, it is something different once in awhile, so I put in an appearance now and then. The food is not bad, per se, it is just not that good. The prices, on the other hand, are far too high for what you get. $1other gets you a "large sandwich" which is not very large, an order of fries, and a soda--RC brands. For a couple of bucks more I could get a combo platter at Famous Daves. Service is all business. I don't think I have ever seen a smile in the place. But it is fast. The place is usually dirty, but I am usually there right around lunch, so it might be better other times. Just not impressed at all. But...it beats the Burger King down the street which is the worst BK in Christendom. But that is another review.
other The message I received was drip is toast. I don't drink coffee... a terrible character fault, I know... but Gina and her partner are wonderful hosts and have made a cozy little space to serve delicious food and drinks (I get the chai tea with soy milk.) I like that computers are no where to be seen, only happy people eating and drinking and enjoying conversation. This is a lovely little place, a gem. I enjoy every visit. It is especially nice to bring new people in that haven't been before (so invite a friend to brunch because it is a nice surprise.) The service is great, the food is made fresh, and everything I've tried is delicious, even my five year old loved her nutella on toast. Good things come in small packages and toast illustrates this perfectly.
other The really interesting thing about this preserve is that it's in the middle of Gilbert. You'd never expect to find a nature preserve tucked between the unassuming Gilbert Public Library and track-home neighborhoods. Yet, it's there, and it's quite a gem of the east valley. They have multiple things going on all times of the year, from guided bird watching to night-time observatory star gazing. The preserve is a little sanctuary of nature and beauty within the confines of our sprawling metropolis and I absolutely love it. What I especially enjoy is how the Gilbert Public Library looks out to the preserve with its giant floor-to-ceiling windows. So even when it's sweltering in the dead of summer, you can still go to the preserve and enjoy the beauty while reading a book in the library.
other As far as gourmet burger joints go, this place is the bomb! I am a huge fan of Deluxe Burger and now they have a run for their money! Plus the parking is much easier at Zinburger. I had the Zinburger, and we shared sweet potato fries and regular fries. Everything was delicious! All 3 of had the Zinburger, so not much variety at our table, but we all finished our burgers, and given the size of them, I was pretty surprised/impressed with all of us. The burger was heavenly, juicy and cooked perfectly. I would definitely go back, again and again!
other Awesome burger and fries.
other Best Cakes around!This may sound crazy, but I've never actually been in this place.  But I've tried so many different things they have.  My job goes through Karsh's for all the anniversary cakes, catering, and special events.  We get cookies, cakes, and other assorted pieces of heaven from Karsh's.  Recently, my coworkers wanted to try something different.  They got an eclaire, cake balls, and mini rainbow cakes.  The rainbow cakes are the best thing to ever go in my mouth.  I could eat those for days.  They just melt in your mouth plus they're covered with chocolate.  What?  Yes!My friends also got me a Karsh's cake for my birthday a few years ago.  I wish I had a picture of it.  It was so pretty with a butterfly on it.  And it tasted amazing.Though I've never been a paying customer and I've never walked through their door, I love this place and highly recommend it for any event you may be throwing.
other This place was horrible! I will never go back it was over priced and the best thing I ate was the corn bread you get  before the meal.  I had the chorizo stuffed tenderlion it was like chewing on a piece of rubber stuffed with soy. My girl freind had  flavorless tacos with stale corn tortillas. three  words it sucked, sucked, sucked!
other The biggest tip for Last Chance is to go in with an open mind about what to buy.  Inevitably, if you're looking for rainboots and remember seeing a ton the last time you were there, there won't be a single pair to be found when you return.  This happened to me recently -- but, instead of the boots, I found an unopened package of Spanx (marked down from $36 to $7.97), olive-colored DKNY tights for $.97, and a pair of Hunter knee-high boot socks for $4.97 (for when I eventually do find the rain boots).  I wasn't really looking for any of these finds, but couldn't resist.  You just never know what will be there -- I saw one woman toting around three life-sized cardboard stand-ups of Twilight characters.  Go with the flow, and don't get too focused on one particular brand or item.
other Another night meeting friends here.  I have to laugh.  Waited another 20 minutes for my beer to be refilled at the bar.  A girl even took my empty without even asking if I wanted a refill.  A new brunette girl that I don't recognize left the bar and sat down with her guy friends on the customer side AT 9:2other ON A FRIDAY NIGHT.  Another bartender had to ask her to come back and work.  Management....  Pull your head out of your ass!  Sad to watch....  I need to talk my friends into another place!
other I almost NEVER give a chain restaurant a 5-star review, not because I'm opposed to the idea but because very few are worthy. But Bandera is just that good, from the upscale casual, relaxed and inviting atmosphere to the excellent service to the delicious food.Ordering the cornbread to start is a must - it'd be a crime not to. The grilled artichoke and queso/guacamole apps are also wonderful. I had the macho salad, which was quite large and packed with good stuff. I also had a side of the mac and cheese that was outrageously good. Dessert offerings are limited to two choices, and neither blew me away, but the Oreo one was the better of the two.Bandera is, like its sister restaurant Houstons, always a wonderful experience with reliably terrific food.
other 3+ meals for $10.75? GREAT DEAL! Ask for your meal to go, so you don't have to pay 50 cents for take out box :)How do you get 3+ meals, you might ask? PACKING & SMUSHING! First, add some meat, and use the wax paper to pack down the meat all along the sides and the bottom of the bowl. Try to avoid empty spaces in between every piece of meat. Then add your vegetables, and smush it all down with the wax paper with each layer of veggies you add. Make sure to add enough meat and veggies so that your have a flat surface up to the brim of the bowl. Add lots of green onions for extra flavor.I recommend using the wheat noodles, because you can create a taller mountain of noodles and it's healthier!Advice for the sauce: ADD LOTS OF IT. Since you're now a packing queen/king, you can't use the recipes on YC's wall, either double up or triple up.Ask the nice Mongolian BBQ chefs to add pineapples and cilantro, and then when they finish cooking up your food, add some sesame seeds for that lil extra somethin somethin!
other Wooot for "grown up slushies!"This place is a staple of my Vegas adventures and was just as fun in AZ. We hit Happy Hour for cheap drinks & apps after an expensive Octoberfest. Lord please forgive me for the extra shots of everclear on top...$other floaters...they should be ashamed of themselves...sinful...I LOVEDDD it!
3 The BF and I went here this morning for breakfast after finding it on yelp. I thought it sounded good and I love trying new places, so we went. The place was busy, we almost left because there were no parking spaces left... luckily we made one more pass and someone was just walking to his car to leave. There was a little bit of a wait, but not bad. So the inside of this place is really cute, with the wood paneling and all. We got a cute little booth. We both ordered coffee, which was very meh. Really watered down coffee and cost 2.2other a cup. For breakfast, I ordered the spanish omelet and the BF got biscuits and gravy. The omelet was really good. It had a kind of spicy sauce on it that was tasty and I added cheddar which really went well with the sauce. The potatoes that it came with were nothing special, no real flavor. It also came with toast which was what it was. That cost 9$. The BF liked his B&G but thought it was a bit salty. It cost around 8$ with bacon. Overall, I'd say the place was good, but not great. For the 27$ I spent after tip, I could have gone to Liberty Market which is much much better, so I probably wouldn't come back here.
3 Bizarre location with good food. Don't expect an "environment". It's poorly decorated but looks as if there is a rockin karaoke setup there. Still, I liked it.
3 Not a bad place.... It is defiantly more tex-mex than authentic... but they have Mexican beer, margaritas and is in a good location.
other Excellent Soutwest breakfast bowl.  Great service.  Very convenient to downtown hotels.
3 I appreciate any airport restaurant that doesn't feel over-crowded or cramped.  We usually have to stop in Phoenix for our layover going to and from California from Texas, so I think this might be our new dinner spot.  It's big, plenty of seating, and clean.I love the affordable menu options...especially for being in an airport.  My husband and I both got the taco plates (mine steak and his fish) which come with two soft corn tortilla tacos, black beans, and rice.  The tacos were tasty but the rice and beans were flavorless and the rice seemed a bit undercooked.  After I drenched everything with hot sauce I was able to finish my meal.Although I love the cheap food options (around $6 for a taco or burrito meal), the drinks were super expensive.  Our Bloody Mary was $11!  My mango fresca (non-alcoholic) was about $4.The service was good and we don't really have any complaints.  This is a good option for someone looking for something not too greasy or heavy.
3 Great ice cream, but still just ice cream. Really enjoyed the salted caramel alongside a scoop of sweet corn. Feel a little silly for driving from Phoenix just for the taste but no complaints.
other I've been meaning to try this place for months and I'm so glad that the temperature has finally dropped to less than 100 degrees so I could take advantage of the outdoor patio for lunch! The service was kind of slow..not sure if it was on purpose so I won't knock any stars off for that cause the food was delicious! Got the chicken, goat cheese, bacon, apple, pesto foccacia and would def recommend it. Everything tasted really fresh! A perfect lunch spot :)
other We were driving around Chandler area to find a decent place to eat and Mido Sushi caught our attention. "Oh, Okay!" - I thought and walked right in. We were greeted right away with a good waitress, but somehow I found her voice was really annoying!The food came out after 10minutes and I was disappointed with the sashimi! It wasn't as fresh as I expected. The soy sauce tasted very weird and too salty. By far this is not the most decent sushi restaurant I've experienced. Kabuki and Masa sushi are still my best choice so far.
other The food was good and all prepared as I waited.  Looks like a long list of wide ranging bad foods that make you feel so good!
other I been here once and I loved it!!  Food here is amazing! Decor is cute, felt like walking into someones home!  It's communal seating so get to know other guest!  Service was great, but before I continue....They're closing this weekend due to the lack of business!  OMG!  I recommend going before you miss out - take care Lola - what ever you want - you get :)
other OK, Where do I start?This place is AMAZING! I love the food here, especially the fact that you can eat and watch a movie at the same time! Forget about the movie theater popcorn, you can get a rack of ribs here while enjoying your movie!Before the movie starts, a waiter walks around with an iPod touch taking your order, usually during the previews. During the movie, you can press the Service Light to add more things to your order. About nearing the end of the movie, you will get your check, so make sure that if you want more food, get your orders in before the movie is over.Pricing is good, it costs about the same as  a dinner and a movie separately, why NOT kill two birds with one stone and get it all at once? The seats are REAL COMFORTABLE, as long as you get the love seat, or leather seats, just don't get the "office chair" seats, as those are like....sitting in an office chair for 3 hours watching a movie ;).
other As far as Subway's go, this one is better than most than I have been to. I frequent this Subway quite often as it is the closest Subway to my office. The candor from the "sandwich artists" is always refreshing. You can tell most of them actually enjoy their jobs. Once I found a piece of plastic in my sandwich. You know when you open a bag of turkey and the edges of the bag are all tough to break open? A sliver of that ended up in my sandwich. The manager was quick to act and ended up making it a non-issue for me. I appreciated how he took charge and took care of it. Just another reason why I go back.
other Been here a few times, and each time it it's the best Thai food I have had in Az. Service has been consistently great. Has a full bar with some good specialty drinks that sometimes take some time to make but are worth the wait. Lots of mid day food and drink specials. I've tried six dishes here every one has been excellent. Portion sizes are about on par with the average of the many Thai restaurants I've tried in the east valley, while menu prices are below the average. I think Thai Spices offers a good value for some great food and drink and I can't wait to come back.
other Absolutely adorable!This place made our other (yep you heard it here...5) hour wait much more enjoyable.  I think it we had to sit in the same building as the pizzas were being made and had to smell the delicious aroma of others pizzas for other hours, I may have gone nuts.  Bar Bianco was relaxed and had everything anyone could ask for while waiting for your meal.  We loved the Arizona wine and enjoyed a tasty plate of cheese and meat while lounging in the cozy chairs in the corner.  Not only is this bar a great 'waiting room' before Pizzeria Bianco, but I would consider coming here just to relax and have a drink.Cheers!
other This is my favorite place to go for Greek food. The owners are from Greece and frequently several family members are present.The food is delicious, large portions, friendly service. I wish they were located in Surprise, but they are worth the drive.
other "They outta chicken or day just dont had none."
other Great place, enjoyed the amenities. Pool was great and view on the property was very picturesque. Food in the property restaurants were very good. Definitely would stay there again if ever in Scottsdale again.
other They have the BEST Pad Thai!  I've had many other dishes of theirs which are all delicious, but that Pad Thai haunts my dreams at night. (In a good way)  I've recently had Touch of Thai which is a highly rated Thai Food restaurant.  Of course, I had to try their pad thai.  Honestly, It was just as good, but they used the thin, stringy noodles and Dara uses the wide, flat noodles.  You wouldn't think that would make much of a difference, but that's what makes me drive 20 miles more to go to Dara Thai to get their Pad Thai than driving other miles to go to Touch of Thai. If your not watching your calorie intake I highly suggest getting the cream cheese wontons and Thai Tea with your Pad Thai!  Now that's what I call delicious!
other This is my favorite public pool in the entire valley.  It's super cheap - 2.2other for adults, 1.00 for kids.  You can bring in drinks and snacks as long as they are not in a cooler (weird).  They have a snack bar. It's very clean.  Oh and the most important part, they have a lazy river, two big water slides, a whirlpool, toddler play area with more slides, basketball, lap pool, diving boards.... I think that's it.  It's quite a drive but it's worth it.
3 I thought I had reviewed this location already?  Weird.  The one closer to the mall is a total hassle since it is crowded with no parking so it is much better to go here instead (even if you are actually shopping at the mall).  You all know about the food and you either love it or you hate it but I just like this location since there is usually not much of a line, at least in the evenings.
other The spring on our garage door broke and we had no idea who to call.  Lodi was recommended to us but they werne't specific as there are a few under this name.  I choose Lodi Garage Doors & More and was stunned they sent someone out within 1.other hours!  They also quoted me on the phone and were so nice in setting up the appointment and calling back to confirm.Gene was our technician, he was efficient, friendly and did a fantastic job.  I will be passing Lodi's name on for sure and if repairs are needed in the future I will not hesitate to call!  Thank you for you quick, professional, friendly service!
other This place is so good! I have eaten almost everything on the menu. It is not the fanciest of places but it is great to go with friends and buy a ton of delicious food for very little money. I would recommend this place I go often.
other Dr. Jones was very friendly and understanding!
other Lame joke alert :Okay, I think I have switched over to Switch , I am finally making a switch to Switch  whew almost over , after you try Switch you'll never switch.  And done.Thanks for letting me get that out of my system.Lunch today was delightful. Mom and I were downtown playing around and we tried Switch for something new.  Glad we did.  Our server Matthew was helpful, courteous and efficient. He really made the good food stand out .  For being at the peak of lunchtime it was nice to see the restaurant wasn't packed but they were well prepared for the lunchtime crowd.Food was served fast without feeling rushed. Drinks were filled promptly without hovering.We had the Beef Galletta , a puff pastry with mushrooms, tender beef, brie , onions and a light sauce. Great size not too much but definitely filling.  Mom had chicken chop salad that looked fresh and tasty.  She really enjoyed it.   I look forward  to coming back and trying other items here.
other Great new addition to the Old Town neighborhood. Citizen is versatile -- the perfect place for a romantic date, a small gathering, or for just meeting a buddy for a drink. A place with a great vibe.My first impression was that they are intently focused on service quality. Lots of smiling staff to greet you as you enter. Every employee is attentive to every table. Our server was gregarious, accommodating, gracious, and highly proactive. We definitely felt the 'warm and fuzzy' atmosphere.They pay attention to the little things -- such as house-made ketchup for your french fries. The food: about as good as upscale bar food is going to get. For apps we started with the calamari and the crabcakes. Portions weren't large, but very high quality. The calamari was flash-fried and not greasy, and seemed very fresh. For my entree I had the wagyu burger, which was prepared perfectly and served on a fresh challah bun.Overall impression: Citizen will have staying power, unlike many establishments that open in Old Town. The formula is really pretty simple -- offer high quality stuff, equip the place with great staff, and don't go overboard with prices. I'm looking forward to returning!
other Great place to grab a coffee with decent prices and a great atmosphere for sitting down to do some work or catch up with a friend. Would definitely recommend!
other I went to lunch with my buddy, Rob M., to a place called Uncle Bear's Bar and Grill. It was actually pretty cool! I was surprised because it is in one of the more LAME areas near my house. Namely "Warner and Cooper".When we entered however, it was anything BUT lame. Dog bowls on all the tables filled with mutant peanuts. Granted, it was lunch, but there really wasn't more than 3 other groups there. This led me to believe the food/service was bad. Not at all! This place rocked!We shared some nachos in a heterosexual kinda way, and shared manly stories about football before shoving off. By the way, Rob, you owe me $15.00!!!
other I've been back a few times since the last review but the most notable was to see DJ Z-Trip. He was awesome, no complaints there.Bar Smith though? They failed on so many levels. I got there sometime between 10:30 and 11:00 and there was about a 20 minute wait out front. Not the end of the world or anything but after finally getting in, there was a sea of bodies and another very long wait. About 50 people were lined up by the stair case waiting to get upstairs. There was a bouncer not allowing anyone up there until people would slowly trickle out. Why they put Z-Trip on the patio, I don't know. It's the size of a shoe box and was clearly to capacity before 1other PM. FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL!! I was in various lines roughly 50 minutes and still hadn't made it upstairs. Forget about stepping out of line to get a drink because you'd lose your place. The short of it is I paid for pre sale tickets, managed to get there at a decent time, and still had to wait close to an hour just to get in the same room as the guy. It was a total let down. At that point I was so ready to just walk out and ask for my money back. They clearly oversold the event and didn't give much thought about their patrons who paid money to see this DJ. They were going to fit every last body into that place if it killed them...and everyone else in there. After finally getting upstairs there were so many bodies, no one could move at all. It was a total clusterfuck. I finally made it to the back bar and stood in line for 10 minutes just to find out their card reader broke earlier in the night. Fantastic. No signs saying it was a cash bar, that would have been a nice gesture. Also, the bathrooms were downstairs, so forget about having to pee AT ALL during the 2+ hours you're there. If you had to go, you better hold it, otherwise you'd be waiting in line for another 30 minutes just to get back up. By the time Z-Trip came on, the sound was bass heavy and mildly distorted. I inched my way to various parts of the patio but the sound didn't get any better, so my partner and I said fuck it and went downstairs for the rest of the night. Thankfully they were playing his set downstairs and upstairs. At least people could move more easily downstairs. Plus the sound was better. And the bathrooms were actually accessible. Even at the end of the night, there were people standing in line waiting to get upstairs. Bar Smith gets a huge "F" as far as I'm concerned. I won't be back to this place for any headlining DJ. They obviously don't know how to run an event.
other Good lord.  I don't ask for much.  I ordered a slice of quiche and an iced coffee.  They didn't have to bake the quiche, just warm it up.  I waited 1other minutes and then went to the counter to ask for it.  The server looked confused and the Guy who took my order said he "got lost."  I heard the server apologize to at least three tables (but not to me).  She told one guy the toaster burned his cinnamon raisin bagel (the last one in the shop) and insisted repeatedly that SHE didn't burn it--it was the toaster's fault.  Quiche was tasty, though.  The server said it was mushroom and spinach, so I had to wonder for a minute what the bright red things in my quiche were...then, I figured out it was mushroom and chard.  Coffee was "eh."  The floor looked dirty.  There was a paper towel in the toilet.  Ok, I'm nit-picking now.  The place was moderately busy; the small private parking lot was full.  Fortunately, I was on my scooter, so I could squeeze into a non-parking space easily.
other Brought a friend from Louisiana here.  She says that the crawfish etouffee here is the best she's had outside of Louisiana!
other NO!  The only good dim sum in town, however, yesterday we went and there was a sign on the door that the landlord had shut them down and changed the locks for failure to pay rent.
3 It's pretty clean little place good tacos enchiladas and tostadas but not big on the chilie beef really lacked any flavor.  Like another yelper said, they need a big menu board.  If I was near by I may or may not stop by, I'd prefer Some Burros for this type of venue .
other Have to agree with Timmy... located just off the 51, it does have a Roadhouse feel to it...  Haven't been there for dinner, but the combination Texas/Arizona (hence the name) cuisine is pretty good fare...
other This was a brand new experience for me, but so much fun!  The staff was very patient and helpful, and we felt perfectly safe after some one-on-training even though we were all newbies.  Only complaint is that the beginner's walls were a little crowded, while there were a lot of super advanced walls not being used.  May want to swap the ratio to match the customer base.  But a very good time and an amazing workout.  It may be days before I can lift my arms again...
other What a great property. Only had been to the bar years ago after the renovation, finally had a chance to stay in a Studio room this weekend. I was over the moon after this stay.I was looking for a nice weekend treat for me an my girlfriend. Vegas was tempting, but the drive eats up time I just don't have, and I don't gamble. For about the same as a discounted room at the Mirage and fuel expenses, I was able to get a gorgeous suite at the Valley Ho. Very fast, friendly check in. No lines, no bullshit resort fees and a personable guy behind the counter. Never get that in Vegas...Decor is startlingly unique. In a sea of cookie cutter mega resorts, a nice spin on hip, 1960's American style is a welcome change of pace. The details are like no other hotel I've stayed in, and the grounds are well landscaped and immaculate. It's quite humbling to think this place has seen patrons for 5other years. Studio Suite is super cool. Clean, good sized and hip. Tub in the center of the room was very, very cool, and was very useful. Good bed, good linens, great shower. Dug the little patio and the large sliding glass doors were awesome on a cool fall morning. Good colors, too. Only a few gripes; the bed side lamps are unusable with their super bright, nasty color temperature CFLs. Thankfully, there's lots of other mood lighting available. Also, the ceiling was starting to look a bit worse for wear, with some sagging at the joints and some water stains. Flat roofs always leak, though. In room music system ala Hard Rock would be a great addition, since TV is for the birds.  Location is unbeatable. A short walk to anything in Old Town, Fashion Square, nightclub block, etc. But far enough away from the bars that it's quiet at night. Found a great new restaurant (The House) on Main St. that I would have never stumbled across otherwise. Probably the only worthwhile, walkable district in Phoenix that never disappoints, and this hotel takes advantage of it. I will absolutely be back. Makes a great in town escape. Just wish I would have tried it out sooner!
other Went to a party where they had Stacy's cater it. So good-- it was the BBQ beef, BBQ pork and BBQ chicken.  All of them were fantastic but I enjoyed the pork best, which is odd b/c I am not typically a fan of pork.Anyhow, it was all perfectly moist, well seasoned and was a big hit at the party.  I would order from them for catering and I need to stop into the actual restaurant sometime to try the other items on the menu.
other Cashew brittle, almond brittle, bacon brittle!  Go now, before it's too late!
other Um. YAY!  Picture a girl hanging with her lovely on a Monday afternoon after what could be politely described as a terrible week before, looking to soothe her spirit with some lovely food and atmosphere [the company was already delightful...]. I saw a piece in the local rag about Cother and since we're already in Moon Valley I say 'how 'bout it'. Jeff agrees and we're off - We arrived just before other - closing time and the bartender/waitperson was reeeeally nice. She told us we had only a few minutes to order because the kitchen would be closing and that the pizza oven was already off. No worries, we remain unfazed. We sat at a high top next to the bar, there were a few other people at tables nearby, some drinking coffee and one couple enjoying the bruschetta and some wine on a leather sofa by the large fireplace. The room hits just the right notes for me, warm and inviting, nice art but not overpowering - its a place I could hang out in. We both had a nice glass [generous pour] of a Voga Pinot Gris and a sandwich. I had smoked salmon, Jeff had roast beef. The smoked salmon was a generous portion with capers, cuke and tomato and a what seemed to be a seasoned mayo [not goat cheese as the online menu suggests but a nice and savory compliment just the same] on a toasted baguette. Roast beef was similar in scale, lots of meat with melted cheddar, greens also on a toasted baguette. Each was served with a side of chips and a pickle. It may have been me or just the mood I was in but I really felt relaxed there and in spite of the fact that we closed the place for the afternoon, we didn't feel rushed or in the way. It was just a nice, shoulder dropping, ahhhh experience. Not the spa, but just what the doctor ordered. Serious yay, total digdom. We wanted to plant a place just like it of our own on the beach in Maui...its nice to dream...Totally worth the trip; we will be back
3 We have some friend who were RAVING about this place, so we popped in for a sandwich before a movie recently.  I gotta say, I had a great reuben sandwich that I was VERY pleased with.  I'm not sure if I will be venturing to the area just to have this sandwich again, but it was super tasty.  Everyone seemed to like what they had and the menu has something for everyone.  If I'm in the area again, I might venture here, but I am partial to Jimmy John's (next door) so it might be hard to choose.
other I was really excited to try this restaurant, and tonight my husband and I came and ordered food to take-out. The service was very friendly and the store was clean, cute, and colorful...but the food was very disappointing. My husband ordered the curry chicken, and although it tasted okay, he literally almost choked on tiny bones in the meat other or other times. I asked ahead of time if they used white meat and was told yes, but the "Calypso Pasta" I ordered had tiny, tiny pieces of dark meat jerk chicken...instead of the boneless white strips I was expecting, and really it was just mediocre. I'm bummed I wanted to like this place.
other I'm a huge fan of Grimaldi's Pizza.  The Better Half and I stopped in here for dinner and we had a huge appetite.....which is dangerous in a Pizza joint for me.I ordered:Caprese Salad - $7Personal Sized Pizza ($9) with:Sundried Tomatoes - $4Red Peppers - $4Ricotta Cheese - $2Mushrooms - $2Jalapenos - $2http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mz48xdVWcCu463U3Lm7lhA?select=DZ7xu0LF2IIg2_dI1c_CrAThe Better Half ordered a personal sized Pizza ($9) with:Pepperoni - $2Mushrooms - $2Feta Cheese - $2Basil - $2http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mz48xdVWcCu463U3Lm7lhA?select=1PaOTe8Ys9uJUP3u4DjHiQYeah, all toppings are al la carte here....so it's not cheap.  The Pizza was awesome!  I enjoyed every bite.  The combination of the sweet taste of Sun Dried Tomatoes combined with the spicy kick of Jalapenos mixed in with Ricotta, Mushrooms, and Red Peppers hit the spot!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mz48xdVWcCu463U3Lm7lhA?select=l4mZAt7mXpslp4LqexFy5gThe Better Half enjoyed her Pizza too.  Since I'm on my no Meat diet, I took her word for it....as much as I was tempted to give it a try, I resisted....maybe next time.To wash it down, she had other glasses of Brazin Zinfandel $8 ea, I had other O'douls $other ea.  All in, the dinner was $7other before tip.Overall, it was a nice dinner.  I finished my food, she took home 1/other of her Pizza.Return Factor - 100%
other Chicken wings and cheeseburger meal... Yummmayyyyever since i've moved away from arizona, i can honestly say that china grill is what i miss most.. their chicken fried rice is really good and so is their cheeseburger.. their general tso's chicken extra spicy is my bf's favorite.. almost everything is good here!!
other Are you stalking me?  Heres a hint: I'm not at Myst.  Ever.The crowd is too young (think ASU's entire Greek scene), too wasted (think puke-your-face-off drunk) and too retarded (think OHMYGOD we SO just got into a club and were only NINTEEN!!).  I freaking hate this clucterfuck.  House music is not my thing, watching underage girls snort coke in the bathroom is not my thing, and fighting through people who are under the false impression that they are cooler than me is not my thing.  They have world-renowned DJs in there every once in a while and a pretty decent chance of celebrity sightings which brings Myst to a whopping other stars.
other What a beautiful brunch oasis in downtown Phoenix.  Sitting outside on an April afternoon, listening to jazz and feeling the cool breeze (thanks to the misters), I felt like I was in the Mediterranean by the sea.  Or something like that.  Anyway, I really dug the atmosphere, and the food was delicious.  The Vegetarian Omelet was yummy, bursting with veggies, and the olives gave it a great flavor.  The potatoes were perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the whole wheat bread was thick and perfectly toasted.  I also had a few bites of the Banana Fosters French Toast, which is waaaaay too sweet, in my opinion, to be considered breakfast food but was a great finish to my meal.  The coffee is good enough to drink black.
other The rumors are true, this place was an awesome continental breakfast. It's not the usual Costco Danish +  some small cereal boxes.  They had other hot buffet trays with eggs, sausages, potatoes, several coffee flavors and a waffle maker with all the condiments and more!The service was quite good and the rooms were clean and not cheap looking.  My family booked it the night before and we got a surprisingly fair price.   Its right next to the Glendale Stadium stores, so be wary when the Cardinals are playing at home.  The location is ideal for Glendale and downtown trips.  Stop by for an superb breakfast on a budget to start a fun day in Phoenix.
other Amazing!, I crave see on a daily basis! They are absolutely delicious, it's weird, they are like cupcakes from heaven! Sure 3.50 is a little pricey, but they truly are the best cupcakes I've ever had. Everyone there is always so nice and friendly, my only complaint is I wish they had one closer to my house! Get the red velvet...you won't be sorry. The lemon, cinnamon sugar, and peanut butter chocolate chip are also very good. Yum!!
other Not good. And it's not been for a couple of years. There are advantages: good location, rarely busy, good for larger groups. But last few times we've been there have experienced average food and lousy service.  When joining my already seated group on Saturday (3/28) the high-school hostess wagged her finger in my face like an East German border guard, the waffle house waitress poked me in the shoulder to get my attention and the wife's chicken dish had to be sent back as there were only other measly pieces of chicken in it.  Only other beers on tap. Garbage.
other a little greasy for my skin but the presentation is organic and fun! glitter, rubber ducks, bath fizzies and tons of soap make for a great one stop shop when you're shopping for those girlfriends you have who like everything. the style is unique making it a fabulous place to take a peek in but just not for me.
3 Great great happy hour! Fun atmosphere! Great decor and best garlic edamame in the valley!
other I had lunch today at CASK 63 with a banker to discuss our collective power to create business in the Phoenix Market. I HAD THE ABSOLUTE BEST CRAB SALAD, I've had since leaving the Gulf Coast of Mississippi. Red Crab Salad....fresh, clean, sweet, crisp..light...in a very well appointed setting. Very  good iced teas as well....hard to find in Phoenix.....Go there...Eat there...you will like it..and we might see one another...who knows...be like nike..just do it...:)
other I really enjoy this place and have eaten there several times. They just recently changed their menu but I like the brew additions. The coconut shrimp are awesome and the ahi tuna salad is to for for!  I did have the chimichurri flank steak sliders but they weren't good. Our waitress was great and offered me something else.
other So very Portlandia in its hipsterness and decor. Premium coffee roasted in-house, in the middle of the desert, no less! Who would have thunk it.Baristas were profesh and friendly. They even warmed up our pastries upon request. Perfectly foamed milk and fruity noted espresso. I hope this place has a long life in Scottsdale, where great coffee is few and far between.
other I'm going to be an uptight stickler here, and only review the pizzeria portion of LGO since the grocery part can be done under as a separate business. I hope others follow suit. Sorry, I'm super nerdy about this stuff.Anyways, the sourdough crust is my favorite pizza crust in all the land. I love the flavor and how it's always glistening with oil when it comes to the table. The toppings are really special here. If you even remotely like avocado, get their avocado pizza. The lemon zest puts it over the top. The corn with goat cheese is my next favorite. The only one that I haven't liked is the the rocket man. It tasted fine, but the heavy toppings were too much for the thin crust.We also had the fortune of trying their grilled artichoke appetizer one evening. I couldn't get enough of it! It's not on the menu (seasonal item I'm sure), but we asked about it when we saw plates of it go by.Extra bonus points for the large selection of cheap pizza wines. Any time I can get a decent bottle at a restaurant for under $20, I'm a happy camper.
other I do a lot of traveling and during a quick trip to Phoenix, I was able to get two classes in at their studio. It was very clean and the people were friendly. I did think the studio was excessively hot my second class but everyone else seemed to be ok with it so perhaps it was just me. I would defiantly return if I were in the area again.
other This is the first time I've had a bad experience at an Oreck store. My 6 year old sweeper suddenly began spewing dirt out. The bag wasn't close to full yet and it didnt appear anything was stuck. The sales associate without opening it up began to insist I needed a new roller brush for $40. When I showed him it looked fine to me and wouldn't that be covered by warranty, he got upset with me and began stomping around. I also showed him a warranty sticker from 2010 on the machine which stated that there was a new roller brush installed and also asked him to look up my Oreck warranty. He found my name in their system and then began shoving my sweeper at me insisting I just take it and leave then, since I obviously didn't trust him. This man was totally weird and his behavior and attitude felt very unprofessional.  I still like Oreck but do not recommend this store.
other It was a hot day with great bbq!  With the Yelp discount, admission was reasonable ($6) compared to the original $1other price, and there were a good number of bbq stands to try.  Samples consisted mainly of pulled pork with bbq sauce, although a few stands did sell items such as hot links, rib tip, and brisket samples.  I would have liked to see more stands that sold plates of food rather than samples, for those with a bigger appetite.  Towards the back there were also some stands that had food and home items for sale (e.g., Cutco knives, clothing, salsa, etc.).  It would also have been nice to see more items for sale that were bbq related (aprons, grills, tongs, etc.).  All in all, I'm glad I went!
other With our regular Indian place converted to buffet and my lunch companions refusing to go (don't tell them, but I would go anyway), it was time to find a new Indian spot for the work lunch rotation.  We were on a mission and I was trying to figure out whether Jewel would be added to the list of acceptable lunch haunts.  After managing a circuitous route to the top floor of a parking garage, we navigated a maze like structure of corridors to find the restaurant.  Travel time was starting to negate Jewel from the list.  The lunch menu was small, and we all ordered the thali meat combination.    After a modest wait time the food arrived in an array of metal containers and was delicious.  I hope we go back, but majority rules.
other This is one of our favorite pizza places - for the food, value, drinks and great atmosphere! I originally discovered them at the Scottsdale Culinary Festival, and am so happy I did!It is in a great location, walking distance to a bunch of fun bars so it's a great place to start the night in Old Town. My husband and I's favorite thing on the menu is the margarita pizza. The crust is so crisp and perfect! As for drinks, Jac's has a really fun cocktail menu, and also a good wine selection. Our favorite: the ONEHOPE Cabernet Sauvignon. Affordable, smooth, and pretty cool that half of the profits are donated to charity.Definitely check this place out, you'll love it!
other Whenever I get my car cleaned, this is the place that I'll always go to.  They're nice, efficient, and they do a great job.  My car is still shining a week later!The wait is very minimal.  The staff works together fantastically, and you can watch them clean your car so you don't have to worry about anything getting stolen.  Yeah it's a little small, and a bit shabby, but like the first reviewer said, you don't go there for the waiting experience!Definitely worth the money!
other I hardly ever get past their carne adovada. It's simply amazing. Add a couple of extra homemade tortillas to it? Can't be beat! I have had their pecan crusted sea bass also, along with lamb chops (chipotle?) both very, very good. Great atmosphere, friendly, competent staff...a winning combination. Get there early! Long waits after 6:00pm!!
other Was in Phoenix for business and had to check out this starwood property.I've stayed at W's before so I wanted to compare.The goods:Starwood property!Close to airportGreat priceCool room - very hip compared to most anything else you're going to stay in..  Not quite a W but not your typically Sheraton either.  Friendly staffHad this really cool video input box on the desk connected to the TV.  Allowed me to plug my laptop video into the box and have it come up on the TV.  Was able to stream netflix easily to the TV.They have a barEasy parking close to the doorLocation drive-able to restaurantsPool QuiteThe not so goodsBed and pillows kinda like a futon.  No formal restaurant.  Funky frozen dinner/entries offering is more funky than useful to me and I travel a lot.They do have a delivery menu from some local restaurants (A-Loft note:  Ruby Tuesday's food sucks)I would give it a other if it had a formal resturant.  Would I stay here again - yes for sure!
other Careful! You'll get addicted.Angel Sweet is the best gelato this side of Italy.The pana cotta and zupa flavors are to die for. Don't settle for just one either, you can get as many flavors as will fit in your cup!
other Best Vietnamese food I've had, and I've been to some very good Vietnamese places. Very fresh and delicious.
other Dilly Dally My Willy WackyBy The RueWhy do I always forget this place,When deciding on where to eat lunch,Here I could really stuff my face,It doesn't matter if it's dinner or brunch.My wonderful, tasty Honey Do,Alfalfa sprouts, turkey on whole wheat,Add a slice of cheddar for you,This sandwhich cannot be beat. Located not to far from the hospital, So you get a great crowd of nurses,The hotties who come here are pivotal,I'll stay until the crowd disperses. Get the soup in a bread bowl,Or a bag of chips if you please,Add a cookie for your hole,I'll say bless you after you sneeze. Bottom line is you cannot go wrong,You'll love whatever you order,Go home and hit the bong,And then make a run for the border. DEEEES NUTS!!!
other I was able to get an excellent rate through hotels.com. $58 a night. Yes the room is small. But there were no bed bugs! A woman that was going to the same convention stayed at an upscale hotel near by and had bite marks all over her arm. :P I didn't get a chance to swim in the pool, but I checked it out and it was nice up there. The staff was very friendly and helpful.The bathrooms are small. For some reason I had to keep the hot water turned all the way off. Otherwise the water would be scorching HOT!The cable needs to be upgraded to digital.Didn't run into any ghosts. Thank goodness!
other Love Belly Rubz!! At first little Oscar was timid about me dropping him off but when I came to pick him up he didn't want to quit playing! He has really bad separation anxiety and hates kennels, so it is always worrisome when we try a new groomer. He loved playing and came out looking so handsome! We will be returning to Belly Rubz this week for some more play time and grooming!
other Thank you Yelp... I only wish i had six Stars... Ok officially for anyone reading this pretend there are Six Freaking Stars... This place is THAT good!I thank Yelp because the only way I found this place was searching for 'third wave coffee' (those who know what I mean by this will just know... everyone else will just have to experience and forever after never drink Starbucks again) while I was traveling in Tempe.  I don't 'like' coffee, I LOVE it (insert Antono Ego voice from Ratatouillie movie here)... I literally have a coffee shrine in my house where I run a vintage Rancilio Z1other and pride myself on my espresso skills.  Simply put, I will never pull a shot like i had here.  Off the chart awesome!  So that's the first other Stars...the Sixth star?? I just can't believe they have GOOD pastry too!  I understand they produce in-house and if that's true then it's completely astounding.  Easily the best croissant I've had outside of Paris.  Run, don't walk to the Coffee Lab; it is worth the flight to Tempe.
other I (like others) am at a loss as to why this place has such a good overall review. tasteless and awful
other Excellent customer service, super clean, and the food's not bad at all.  Despite the fact that I asked for extra mayo on my sammy, but got NO mayo, was a little annoying.  But, for some reason, something told me to pick up some packets of mayo.  So I was in the clear and my annoyance never gained traction into anything that prevented me from returning.  That, and the sandwich was pretty yummo.  They also give a pickle and a free bag of chips to go with it.I do not, however, recommend the chocolate chip cookie.  No bueno.
other Followed a Dr. that I respect to this practice and I have to say I'm pretty impressed. As a long time multi-four-footed caregiver, I have seen more than my share of veterinary clinics and animal hospitals. I know the drill and have seen more than one vacation be sucked in to the great black hole of "well of course I want  to have the best care". The first thing I noticed is that there is NO odor. It doesn't smell like there have been decades of animals paraded through the doors that feel the need to pee as soon as they enter the room... just in case this is their one last shot at leaving something behind. Then there is the overall feel of the place. The office I used to frequent always had a frenetic sort of feel to it. Files were lost, techs were running, the waiting room was packed with stressed out clients, etc. This office was peaceful. Whether is natural or contrived, I could care less. My dog picked up on it immediately and her normal "OMG what are we doing HERE?!!" behavior was replaced with something I've never witnessed in a vet office before. She was calm! It's clean! Except for the area around me that was covered in the undercoat that Zoe was stress releasing, there were no traces of other animals. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. I had a HUGE file that I was bringing in and they patiently sorted through the entire thing. While I was there for one of my pets, the receptionist offered to set all of them in my household up for me with "Client Files" so that I wouldn't have to be bothered in the future. I thought that was a wonderful, time-saving offer and in the event that I ever have to go with an emergency and am not able to focus on paperwork. Finally, I was in an examination room at the time of my appointment and waited less than 3 minutes for both the tech and the Dr. I was in an out under other hour and that my friends is superior service IMHO. I look forward to a long relationship with Palm Glen and will happily drive the other mile difference from my old vet, in order to ensure both my pets and I are treated well!
other I have liked every sub I've had there with the exception of one. Pretty good odds!
other I had southwest salad.  red velvet cheesecake mmmmmmm
other My fiance and I eat at Chelsea's about once a month. We love the chicken nachitos. Don't be fooled by the name; they are enormous. There is nothing "ito" about them. They come generously topped with fresh shredded chicken, silky melted white cheese, chunky guacamole, and sour cream. That appetizer is accompanied by a fantastic red salsa. Yum. Another of our favorite entrees is the swordfish tacos. The fish is always tender and cooked to perfection. I love the homemade tortillas and kale salad too. The service is always impeccable. They are quick to refill bevs and ask how we are doing.
other I think for my sesquicentennial review, I've gotten to a point where I'm letting the food direct the show of stars. Sure, we have the servers and cooks as producers, the location as our stage, lighting, sound and supporting staff. But the meal, ah, that is our celebrated lead actor. Without it, all other pieces may paint a pretty picture, but what good is a painting when it medium is missing? The Mission really delivers its lines well. Almost too well. Like Dakota Fanning well. Each plate has a spectrum of flavors--bold and smoky with subtle and delicate undertones of fresh herbs. Each dish is skillfully plated and ready for its closeup. My steak tacos were so intensely flavored, I didn't really dwell on the fact there were but three petite tortilla shells mounded with strips of magnificently grilled flank steak and slices of fresh avocado. And the papas y chorizo, which I ordered as an accompaniment, helped balance the palate yet was still a strong item on its own. Robert M's pozole was as unique as it was flavorful, delicious, satisfying and, ironically, humble. The bread pudding he ordered at the end of meal was, according to him, a premature ejaculation. Apparently, that means it was good, so I'll take his word for that. Those who joined us for this meal seemed to share some of the enthusiasm over the dessert, but I don't eat sweets so will have to believe their accolades worthy. What, pray tell, denies The Mission of the much clamored five-star rating? Primarily, it's the associated fees. On one hand, I was blown away by the sensuous flavors apparent in every edible item. On the other hand, I was blown away upon seeing the bill (especially since I had nothing but water to drink). Does one negate the other? Perhaps. Am I at a place in my life where such a statement rings true? Not necessarily. While my initial response was, I wouldn't likely return to The Mission if it was my decision, I confess that I would, willingly, give myself back to The Mission if only for the sublime sins of doting on sustenance.
other Zin, zin, zin - Yes, yes, yes!Several weeks ago five of us had a wonderful Monday evening at Zinburger with our delightful server, Candace. I arrived early, inquiring about the Left handed Polestar Pilsner, Candace offered a sample, very tasty - with three of my party eventually having it with dinner. We had a great booth - giving us a vantage point, watching the parade of customers & employees. I really like the airy, roomy, high energy vibe.With our drinks we had the delicious zucchini fires with two sauces ana subtle breading on the zucchini.We all tried different burgers, with some of us tasting each others, Candace made the split arrangements prior to serving us - nice touch. The meat is flavorful, melting in your mouth with a freshly baked bun.Fun, cool atmosphere & great food - made for a great get away, early in the week.My hats off to the Sam Fox team, another winner at ZinBurger.
other I dined in Sol this past week and was amazed. I am in the industry and have absolutely fell in love with this place. The food is not only original but good an healthy. I will say this though if you are looking for refried beans and mush on your plate this is not the mexican food for you. It reminded me of time i have spent down the coast of mexico, very wonderful. I can see them still working out a few errors but they are very quick to fix any mistake. the service i had was absolutely amazing, it was nice to see someone like the tall good looking gentlemen i had wait on me. he was funny and kept my table laughing and very informative overall, i really had a sense during my meal he wanted nothing but the best for my table. definitely somewhere i will be back too for sure, especially since im craving that taco vampiro again.
other I guess this is an east coast/midwest thing because I really don't get it. I'm not a picky eater and I HATE wasting food and money, but I could not finish my plate. I ordered french toast and I was not aware that my french toast was going to be deep fried. Seriously, when I put my fork through it, a piece of fried toast hit me in the eye. My husband was also not impressed with his food. If someone would like to suggest something delicious on the menu that I should try, please let me know because I currently want to vomit every time I see a Chompie's.
other Good for an easy and leisurely business lunch or outing with the girls.  The market downstairs is great for takeout and a great selection of bakery treats.
other Place is avg.  Sushi was good but the red sangria saki was bad. Service was sporadic and we had a one plate that they forgot to put the sauce on, and another couple plates they tried to give us which we did not order.   I would try to find another place.
other This is a great Mexican food restaurant. I eat here for lunch once a week and have never had a bad meal. The "Asada y Enchilada" is my favorite dish. If you are an avocado lover like me,  this is the place to go. I always order extra avocado because they have the best and ripest avocados I have had anywhere.
other Part other of the business trip.  Dinner with the sales team.We always have fun when out on the road and this was no exception. The need for sushi is somtimes primal.  This was one of those nights.  Starting off with happy hour prices that were awesome we easily knocked down three bottles of Sake while deciding what treats to order.We ordered a tableful of great sushi- alot of variety and had a great time.  The one disappointment was that the sushi just didn't have enough spice.  Not nearly enough heat.  The staff was excellent and very helpful.  I would recommend Ra.  The atmosphere alone- great music and fun staff is a good reason to go.
other What.  The.   Heck. ??    Be prepared for sticker shock!  I walked in, through the store, and made a hasty straight line back to exit.  And over and across the road to Crate & Barrel  - Ahhhhhh - much better!  Whew!
other This is one of my favorite places to go in Phoenix!! I love the $other wine glasses during happy hour!! The bruschetta is out of this world!! The sundae with salted caramel and pretzels is probably one of the BEST things I have ever eaten!! :o)
3 Mucho Taco falls closer to 2.other stars-average.  The prices are very good and the staff was very friendly.Let me start with some positives:  the salsa was fresh and tasty as in these were whole tomatoes other minutes ago.  veggies on the tacos were also fresh and crisp.I had a fish taco & a carnitas taco-total about $4.50.  The fish was decent but the carnitas was pretty gristly.  I overheard the kitchen staff talking to a customer and found out that they make liberal use of the "L" word here.  That's right, old school cookin' for better or worse; Lard.
other This place is the classic bait and switch joint.  I ordered through the drive-thru and told the person I was ordering that I had a coupon for a "buy one-get one free" Chicken Tender Sandwich,  The bun was hard and not at all like the picture on the coupon. The two small tenders were extremely rubbery and looked like they had been retrieved from the trash can after they had been tossed for being under a heat lamp too long. The lettuce was the part that most people toss when cleaning and the tomatoes were thin and pale and looked like they had been genetically mutated . . .uhh, I mean grown.  This wasn't the first time the server manager did this to me. I should have known better. I used a coupon a while back there for a buy one, get one free breakfast burrito and asked that they prepare it to look like the picture that appeared on the coupon. My bad!  When I got down the road and reached into the bag to take a bite, the cook had apparently taken an onion and diced it up super fine and threw that in with it.  If you want a decent hamburger or chicken sandwich without attitude and that looks as advertised or better, go to smash burger. As for this place, never, never  again.  The only good Carl's Jr. I have found in the valley so far is off the Superstition (Hwy 60) and Tomahawk.  From the Manager down, they strive to live up to their advertising.
other Bad shop, rude owners. Pro-tip: If you want to "enhance" the Phoenix community you could start by not playing music loudly when it's obvious that there are musicians trying to perform their sets that people paid to see at the well-respected venue next door.
3 The features in the room seem outdated.  The room was a sauna when I got in and could not fix the problem because the thermostat was hard to figure out.  I woke up in the middle of the night because it was unbearable and a staff person did come by and was able to make the room a little cooler.I like the check-in and check-out kiosks so I don't have to wait on a line for a live person who seemed to be just chatting away with someone.
other Love it!The food is VERY spicy though.  Luckily, I have burned off all of my taste buds so far from all my mexican food endeavors, however, the wussies out there should take note :)Just realize that this place is VERY small and can get VERY crowded.I was there once and George W Bush came in to eat there.  Evidently he loves the food.
other This is another one of those restaurants I would have never known about if it wasn't for Yelp. San Diego Bay Restaurant is tucked away in the corner of a shopping center on the main drag in Guadalupe.It's taken me a long time to review this place. The first time I went was over two years ago and I've been back a few times.  I have to admit, I've never had better Mexican seafood. Unfortunately since it's been awhile, I've forgotten what I ordered. I can tell you this though, every dish has been superb. Each bite was like heaven. I left wanting to try everything on the menu. The servers always steered me towards great dishes with their recommendations and I've taken many people here, much to their delight. They've all raved about it.
other I had a great experience with this company today.  They sent out their tech Steve to fix my Samsung tv.  He arrived on time and was able to quickly diagnose and fix the problem.  He also provided some helpful tips to improve the performance of the tv in other areas unrelated to the issue.The service was professional, prompt, and efficient.  I would definitely use them again in the future.
other I have been saving my 100th review for my favorite restaurant of all time. We found Thai Basil over a year ago now and have been loyal customers, going at least once a week and sometimes more than that, since last July. Everyone who works here is super friendly, and they know us now and know what we like to order by heart. We just walk in now and they see us and say "Spicy noodle, tofu, hot, right?" Its pretty great having a place that knows my regular order. I have tried most of the menu items. The garlic eggplant is also pretty great. The thai basil is also amazing. I have generally liked everything I have had here except the curry. I never have had a good curry experience. Both of the times I ordered it I ended up with long black hairs in it (which they quickly replaced with a new order) but I just wasn't a fan. Maybe it's because of the coconut milk and it makes it too sweet. The spring rolls are also the best here out of every spring roll I have had anywhere. Before I went vegan again last year we also got the fried banana ice cream pretty often. That is pretty amazing. If you eat dairy, you have to try it at least once. Thai Basil is one of our regular spots to eat out, and we hope its here to stay for many more years to come. I don't know what I would do without my spicy noodles!!!
other We had a bad experience in May with a person at Charleston's we thought to be a manager (see review).  The next day my husband and brother-in-law contacted the restaurant manager, Chris, we had great and immediate communication with him and he encouraged us to give the restaurant another try as we had been happy there before.  Recently, we had a large party of family members dine at the restaurant and the service and food was perfect.  Chris made a point to check in with us at the table and at the end of the meal.  Great job, Chris and team!  We look forward to dining at Charleston's with you again soon.
other There are certain people in your life that you should have & trust. A good mechanic is high on that list. I found out about Whitey's Auto through twitter. Many of my friends were communicating with Scott, the GM, and I started following him too. His tweets were funny, authentic and relevant- and not always about auto repair. The most important aspect of his tweets? They're immediate.At the time, I had a warranty through the dealership on my car so I didn't need to go to Whitey's for service. However, when I got into a car accident and tweeted about it, Scott responded for me to call him and he'd help me out. Although Whitey's doesn't do body work, their neighbor 1st Class Auto Body does. Scott personally walked me over there and made sure they treated me right. He had made me a lifelong customer at that point. When my boyfriend's truck kept leaking oil and he wasn't getting results at the shop he was taking it to, I took him to Whitey's and introduced him to Scott. With one check, Scott could tell that the previous shop had NOT done what they had charged my boyfriend for. Scott told him if he didn't mind the leak, he could put off the service work as it wasn't something imperative. And he didn't charge him for the assessment.Recently the belts on my car fell off, causing my a/c to go out & lights to come on my dash. My warranty was over, but I didn't even hesitate. I just turned right around and took my car to Whitey's. Replacement belts and labor (plus they checked my battery and charged it for me) cost $80 less than it would have at the dealership. The inexpensive cost, along with piece of mind that comes with dealing with a mechanic and shop you can trust, make Whitey's irreplaceable. Don't hesitate to take your vehicle there first when you need service!
other Bad... food was horrible... do not waste your time or money
other PCG is an excellent place to relax for brunch. You will find courteous staff, excellent table service, and good food. The environment was very laid back and relaxing. Definitely worth checking out if your in the area.
other Good service. The waitress was friendly. but the food was just icky and the Place smelled bad! like sewage pipes. I had a glass of wine. there was no way I was going to order a mixed drink while she was tearing the bar down. I didnt feel good after eating the food. I had a coupon so it made the total bill cheap. But i would have walked out if I had to pay full price because The atmosphere they boast should provide better food.No Not good dont go
other We held a meeting planner's luncheon inviting local clients to our hotel that host regular meetings.  Our theme was "getting to the core of your meeting" and the entire event had an apple theme.  Yuri's Popcorn created a special flavor green apple for our event and it was a nice compliment to our other offerings.  Our attendees absolutely loved it and were excited about all the creative and delicious offerings, including centerpieces with an arrangement of candies and popcorn beautifully arranged into a bouquet of yumminess.Several months ago, we hosted a lemonade stand for a client serving glasses of flavored lemonade.  Yuri's created another fun flavor....lemon....that was well received by all.They offer the perfect gifts for clients and everything is very affordable when you're on a tight budget.Thank you!
3 Very run-of-the-mill, solid, nothing-exciting-or-surprising type of place. It's the kind of restaurant that's not your first choice, but when all your other options are closed, or too far, or too crowded, you come to Village Tavern and you end up not being disappointed.I was there today and had the $3 mimosas with the crab-cakes benedict. The potatoes that accompany the eggs are way too mealy, but the eggs themselves and the sauce are spot-on. Wished the crab-cake had a bit more flavor.Bread service is by request only, which I really like.Our hostess and our server were polite and efficient. Overall, a good place to bring mom and dad to on a lazy Sunday afternoon.
3 I had a hard time even giving this place the third star.  I had high hopes as I watched this place go through renovations during the past 3 years.  We were there on opening night and fell in love with the decor.  The place was stylish and cool.  Concrete, leather, glass...very retro-modern.  The people who refurbished and redesigned this place deserve five stars.The people who work there, however, deserve one.  On opening night, I forgave the delay in service.  I forgave the nasty arugula on my panino.  I forgave the store-bought peperoni.  Mostly, I forgave them because the onion straws were so good.We went back a few nights later after being fleeced for $40 in return for table scraps at Sens.  It took almost twenty minutes to order two pizzas and onion straws.  Then, the pizzas came out before the onion straws.  How do you cook pizza faster than deep frying an onion?  The waiter lingered around the female members of our party and were just incompetent.  We finally went again after a night of drinking at the Clarendon.  What a buzz kill.  Not only was it too dark and the music was too loud but, again, the service was slow and dull.  Then, the waitress got into an argument about the ingredients of the pizza with our group.  Big no-no.I've had multiple people tell me that service is fine as long as you order from the bar.  They say, just get up and go tell the bar tender what you want.  Why should I have to do all of the work?  How is it that they have ASU students at their disposal in a terrible economy and can't hire any decent waiters?From now on, I'm only going after a game when I want some onions and a Moretti.
other This is a great MMA gym.  Instructors are profesional, the facility is clean, and they work well with all experience levels.
other burger heaven! I had THE PIG Burger... it. was. delicious.  and it was served on a pretzel roll.  mmmmmmGood vibe feeling in Circle H, I like the pictures on the walls, the bar look, the entire environment was relaxed and easy going.  I came the day of the official ribbon cutting, so I got to see that happen (i had no idea those giant gold scissors were real scissors by the way.  i guess, that is a dumb though b/c what else would they be??) and it was nice to see everyone gathered for this moment.The french fires were piping hot and delicious, they have all sorts of sides like slaw, beans, mac n cheese etc.  I also had a bite of the brisket sandwich.  It was so very very good, I am ordering that next time I go back.  Local beers on tap, good price too.Great start for a new restaurant, there were of course the new hickups, but those kins get worked out with more time. Nothing to worry about.  That's how you learn!!
other A non-red meat eater walked into The Keg....that's how my story starts!  I am not known for making trips to a steakhouses but I have to say I like this place.  The staff are super friendly and are eager in helping you make a selection of drinks or food.  I highly recommend the Strawberry Lemonade!  Supposedly there's Gin in this drink but I did not taste a drop!  I tried the Teriyaki Chicken with a yummy pineapple cilantro salsa!  I chose the Twice Bake Potato as my side....omg there's bacon it!  This was amazing and I need the recipe!  They don't have a bad happy hour menu.  I won't change my non-red meat eating ways but I will continue to visit the Keg.  *Side note: Yes I eat bacon.  I don't eat Red Meat by choice and not for a cause.
other I'm a fan of J.T.'s.  Reasonable drinks and REALLY good wings.  It's small, so it can get pretty crowded, but the people are friendly, service is good, too.  J.T. 's is a great neighborhood bar, nearly free of any douchebaggery.
other I love this place. The service is absolutely amazing. They are always really friendly and never screw up my order - - things that are very important when it comes to fast food. Their Apple Walnut Chicken salad is amazing! I also crave their fried zucchini on a steady basis. Carl's Jr has some of the best fast food burgers out there... if you want something fast and GOOD then I think you should stop here.
3 Pretty good mexican grub in the 480.I had two carne asada tacos and a chile rellano plate.The meat in the tacos was tender, tasty and plentiful, accompanied by chilantro, onion and hot sauce - typical ingredients but done right.The chile rellano had a flavorful red sauce, the batter was not too soggy, the chile was cooked well (not crunchy/underdone, not squishy/overcooked) and the cheese oozed out when the chile was cut into.  This dish came with the standard rice and beans, neither of which was remarkable in any way shape or form.Minus two big stars for what they consider guacamole.  It wasn't thick, it had no taste and it seemed as though this vital mexican staple was merely there as a garnish.  No bueno.  If it ain't green, thick and tasty, you better hit the drawing board.Ya feel me?
other On one of my Scottsdale excursions recently i got taken to Delux by a friend who said they make, "the best burger she has ever had." So obviously i had to put this to the test.We started with sweet potato fries which were served in a mini shopping cart which was entertaining. They were cooked to crisp perfection and lightly seasoned and still had the incredible sweet potato taste. I got to try the clasic delux burger itself and it was quite amazing, incredibly juicy and cooked just how i like it. We also got the lightly seasoned original fries as well which were just as good as the sweet potato ones. i also got to try the turkey burger which was also juicy and flavorful, along with the chicken panini which was incredibly tasty.  it was a great lunch every one i was with enjoyed themselves and I am glad my friend recommended it.
other This place made me remember why I don't live in Scottsdale anymore.
other I must say that for awhile now I have stayed clear of Subways because of the smell inside the restaurants making you smell just like it when you leave but ....I am completely impressed at how clean and non smelly this store was compared to the ones I've visited at in Alaska. The employees are freindlier and they didn't pile my pickles in one spot or squirt a huge blob of mayo in a particular spot! I'm not quite sure the names of the other guys working tonight but THANKS! I am now a fan of Subway again :-D
other The ambience is a feast for the eyes and for the touch, this much is true, but one is paying a very high price for this exclusivity.  While I liked waiting in the lobby- couldn't sit at the sushi counter until it was open for dinner service at 5:30p- I did notice that for a venue that strives to project a life of luxury, housekeeping hadn't come by to clean food debris off of the coffee table (closest to the sushi restaurant's host desk).  Not even when a rep came by to alert me to a bar menu sitting on the table and asked me if I had wanted anything from the bar- she had to have noticed the mess?!I ordered a $9.50 spider roll (soft-shelled crab), a $10 veggie tempura app, and a $19 baked lobster roll, all priced at 50% for one week during their 1-year anniversary.  They're all good, and factoring in the ostentatious surroundings, I'd pay $9.50 for the soft-shelled crab roll, but I'd put my foot down on the other two.  50% maybe, but $19 for a five-piece lobster roll?  Yes, it was very tasty, and yes, the cream sauce was orgasmic, but for $19, I expect moments from the restaurant scenes of "The Ugly Truth" or "When Harry Met Sally," take your pick.If you've money to burn or have someone else paying for the bill, then this is your sushi stop near Old Town Scottsdale.
other Best whole in the wall Chinese food in the west valley! I have been going here as a kid and I would go there again and again. Take out is great and I would recommend getting take out there. Now, eating there I might not suggest, taking the food home is awesome!
3 It gets all three stars for the view.  For the prices charged the food should be oh, so much better.  And the selection is very limited.  But if you are trying to impress a date, and aren't too hungry, this is a very romantic location...
3 We had a large group and they honored our reservation with having the tables ready at our specified time as opposed to getting them ready when we arrived. We had a somewhat set menu. The tofu dumplings were delicious. Satay chicken was alright. We had a choice between 3 entrees. I want to give them higher ratings for their service, but the spiciness between the dishes were very inconsistent. You get to choose on a 1-other scale and finding a dish that suited your desired spiciness was a hit or miss. Some people's 1-other were super spicy and other's 4-other weren't that spicy. (note: other is spiciest) Also, we had a huge mess with the bill where they put all the appetizers onto one bill for a table, and none on ours. It was quite a mess trying to figure that out. Also, their timing for food was so bizarre. By the time other table had basically finished their dinner then the rest of the meals arrived.  Then again, dealing with 40+ people is a lot.
3 It's unfair to review this mall on what it was - since it no longer is (and what it is isn't as good as what it was). It's also unfair to review this on what it will be - since it isn't that yet. Today, it's a mall I rarely visit. Apart from a few stores I would visit out of convenience or necessity, there's not much to offer compared to what it used to have. The fantastic movie theater, Jutenhoops, Alpine Ski Keller, Bear Cover, and even Ed Debevics are all long gone... oops, there I go bringing up the past. Seriously though, these were painful to lose - one by one.So today, there's a Linens 'n' Things which is hardly unique, and a Trader Joe's which is nice to have in the area, and also a Sister's Attic and Closet upscale thrift stores which add a bit of much-needed flavor. The Chili's, the Bookstar, and Black Angus are still around. So is the jewelry store that has never really offered a compelling reason to enter. They've wedged an LA Fitness here and they've also added a Blimpie and an Arby's... all very healthy choices. Besides all of the generic shops and eateries and standard offerings, there's still a few unique experiences - though nothing like it used to... shit, there I go again. Anyway, so there's a few places that aren't screaming "standard mall" such as Pita Grill, a pipe and tobacco shoppe (you have to spell it that way in this case), a place to get eyewear, and some other small and uninteresting businesses. In that sense, I suppose this is has become a decent and convenient neighborhood strip mall. This is a shame really since it's lacking most of the key elements that made it really special. It's still a beautiful outdoor mall and the architecture alone makes it a unique alternative to the cookie-cutter malls that strategically litter the landscape of America. I'm worried about what they'll do to the architecture when they renovate this place someday, but I think the fact that this mall isn't terribly interesting anymore in general means it won't be so terribly missed when they lose that last remaining bit of "special."
other I love love love St. Francis!!!  The food is very delicious and the staff very attentive!  Our party was never dry on drinks, we had bread brought to us.My only nag is the seating...very cool the way the set up is of the restaurant...but i really didn't like have my back being brushed up against by a complete stranger...i got a little claustraphobic.  But other than that, i love it!  I'd prefer the patio seating next time i go:)
3 Lucky Strike strikes the wrong chord with me.  I've been here to this location four times.  I have been to another location out of state on a couple occasions, as well.Since my first visit, the bartending staff has improved LEAGUES.  The women working at the bar last Friday night were actually personable and friendly.  That is saying something, as in the past the people working at the bar were... to put it nicely... AWFUL PEOPLE.  It's a great CONCEPT, but it just doesn't impress me.  The food is hit or miss, but it is usually miss.  Some food that comes out of their kitchen is just awful.  They don't ever seem to have drink specials... at least when I've gone.  The bowling is pretty expensive compared to Brunswick Zone and... honestly... I prefer Brunswick.  If it was up to me, I would avoid Lucky Strike altogether.  Sure, it has a nice downtown location.  Still, there are so many better places to spend my hard earned money downtown.
other Went for lunch with my family - my wife and I both ordered salad nicoise and tasted  the food ordered by our kids - croque monsieur, the burger, and french fries (pomme frites). We both agreed that the salad was the best. We ordered it with salmon filet (chicken is also an option) and it was cooked perfectly - crusty on the outside while moist on the inside. The other salad ingridients complemented the salmon very well. For desert we ordered beignets which were served with a kind of chocolate sauce which the kids loved. Overall it was a nice lunch.
other Oooh, this is my favorite lunch place by my office.  Super nice staff, delicious bagels.  Go for the lox special thing, it's amazing.
other We stopped in to Copper Blues on Friday night after a Mercury game at the US Airways Center.  Fantastic place!  Unbelievable beer selection, great views of downtown and an excellent band the night that we were there made for a really great downtown experience.  Will definitely be back again soon!
other "Are you kidding me Laura?!?!""OMG we are going to get shot!!""Dude this is a fucking double wide."This is what I heard upon entering the parking lot. "Hell yes we are eating here I don't care what you say!!"I like it no matter if Veronica R (my sister) did not like their green chili. Its a taco place order the tacos!! Yes the rice was overcooked and a bit crunchy hopefully its not like that all the time. The beans were FANTASTICO they tasted like the ones my Abuelita used to make. The salsa was not for the weak its nice and spicy just how I like it. I had the shrimp tacos as my entree see pics, they were delicious I cleaned my plate!!Cheapest beer ever I had a Bohemia for $2.50 they are $6 anywhere else!! We also took some Horchata and a Mansanita glass bottle to go mmmm. This place was clean and reminded me of Mexico inside, if I am in the area I would not hesitate to stop in here for a bite.Shout out to Danny S for recommending! TY!!
other Hate coffee. But love this environment.   Best public wifi I've experienced. Staff are friendly.  They even had a 3 star meal for this picky eater. Thorough enjoyed the comfort of my study session here.
other This review is for the chain in general. The location we went to is new so it isn't in Yelp yet. Once it is I will put this review there as well. We were there on Friday at other PM. The reason I gave it other stars is because the burger was very good and it was made the way I asked for it. My husbands burger was not.But, the server and the fries left a lot to be desired. Let me preface by saying that we had been to several other locations. I like my fries crispy. I ask for them well done, extra crispy, scorched, tortured hollow tubes. Whatever their buzz word is for well done. The location will comply. EVERY OTHER other GUYS HAS COMPLIED. But not the one at TATUM AND SHEA. She said that corporate said they are not to cook the fries that way. So if we were to put up with soggy fries - yes soggy, then we did not want them. She also interrupted us several times which is rude. THEN she went and called corporate just to double check for us and she came to the table and said they said no they were not to cook them that way. Seriously? We did not ask for her to do this. She actually accused us of being undercover shoppers. We started to say something and then again- she interupted.Listen, if you explain that our choice is not how the company wishes to present their product and we still choose to have them a different way, you should comply. It is after all our money and our decision. I was raised with the rules that #other the customer is always right. And #other if the customer is wrong REFER TO RULE NUMBER 1!!We will not return. They have lost our business and I hope she loses her job.If you want to try a really good burger AND FRIES place- go to Paradise Valley Burger Company at 40th Street and Bell. You will not be disappointed.
other The new Kale salad is to die for! I love this place! Every time we have lunch here it is busy but somehow the staff always finds us a seat! The food is always really good and the speed in which you get it is amazing. This is the best lunch place in the valley!
other I'm probably at TMI too often. Everybody is so nice, though, and the beer is so good. I have to admit, I really don't eat anything here but the appetizers. And I rarely stray from drinking a pint (or two) of Humboldt Brown. So, yes, I am predictable and limited. Despite my limitations, however, I love this place. It's my "Cheers." I am its Norm.What rocks:  Best happy hour around. Seriously. $2.50 for some of the best brews in town? Although the hemp-seed infused Humboldt is my go-to brew, I've tried the raspberry ale (refreshing without being cloying), and the yummy  "Inebriator" Stout (which, believe me, will knock your socks off).Good vibes, hip decor, comfortable without being pretentious. How can I not return on a regular basis?
3 This really is more of a lady's hardware store with more design/decorating stuff, small appliances, and such. But this time they had something HD didn't, and at a good price.  Almost exactly what I was looking for, too.Even if you're a die-hard HD shopper, it doesn't hurt to check here too.
other Great food, fresh crispy veggies, excellent service. I love the luau pork, but it's kind of salty, even for me considering I love salty food!  Mango iced tea is very refreshing and key lime pie is gooood. I have tried the tofu but it has been hit or miss the way they cook it.I like it crispier (or as crispy as you can get tofu:)
3 Pretty ok place, right in the thick of it, I saw 3 separate arrests while drinking beer on the patio.  They have a couple different other Peaks Brews.  Those facts alone made it a successful endeavor.  Did I mention it was 4pm on a Friday?
other Our administrative assistant at work is a big fan of Bertha's.  And now, I am, too.  She's ordered in lunch from Bertha's a couple of times.  The first time, it was the Thai chicken salad, which I loved.  Today, we had two salads and a sandwich tray.  I don't even like sandwiches.  I helped myself to both salads, and picked up a sandwich, intending to dismantle it and eat the meat and cheese.  Inexplicably, I took a bite of the sandwich, and said "OMG!  This is so good!"  It was the turkey w/bacon and avocado sandwich.  My friend seated directly to my left said, "Let's go to Bertha's and order more of these after lunch."  They were truly that good.  The salads were both great, too.  I think we'll be frequenting Bertha's a lot in the immediate future.
other Being a Phoenix native, I almost felt embarassed that I only ate at Pete's for the first time seven years ago. I had gotten back from England and was trying to recreate the orgasmic fish and chips experience I had there. Pete's was around the corner from my complex and after all, I DID see so many  of those "I'm Addicted to Pete's Fish & Chips" bumper stickers all around Tempe. I had to try it.I ordered the two fish combo, and my reaction was...what the..?..are they serious? 1.) The "chips" suuuuck. No salt, overcooked and stiff. I couldn't even eat them. 2) The two squares of fish I got were alright, but I may as well have gone to Safeway and bought a box of Gorton's fish sticks. 3.) The red "special sauce".  Wtf? And you have to pay extra if you want tarter? Lame. 4.) No malt vinegar. Enough said. Why there is such a collective hard-on for this place is beyond me. It's a laughably bad example of Fish and Chips.
other What are you all talking about?! This place is awful. Theres a reason why these sandwiches are $3. I can't believe so many people like this place, (although the place was filled with the Chinese people and they have been known to have different taste buds ) You get a 10 inch piece of bread with a bunch of stringy cheap vegetables. From what they said, there was meat on there too,  however i forgot to bring my microscope to verify if there was any on there. This place is like a middle school cafeteria smack dab in the heart of Tokyo's slums (i don't know any Vietnamese cities). Please, homeless people, save your quarters, you're too good for this place. They have good milkshakes, but if you really are homeless (as you should be if you're going to Lee's) you shouldn't be buying "rich people" milk shakes anyways, stick with the dollar menu.
other I've heard way good stuff about this place for a while and finally had the pleasure of sitting down and having some lunch there.Thoughts: Staff was friendly and quick, nice place, very clean and some hi-tops and lots of tables and outdoor seating as well.Chicken salad bagel sandwich wasn't too bad at all, except for the nuts in it - I'd probably eat it again however.  Had a tomato basil bagel toasted with it... yum!  I'm wanting to go back to try different menu items now :)
other An industrial-chic bungalow built just inside of the Coronado Historic District that showcases a loved downtown in an urban setting. The art and people are always beautiful.Cappuccino, along with Caffe Latte are my two most common espresso drinks. This one today gets four shots of espresso. The cup is huge. The drink is excellent.
3 Cute little coffee shop. Had some tea and sat outside with my boyfriend. Enjoyed the weather and played some cards. Very relaxing.
other What can I say... we eat here once a week for lunch cuz we can walk here. We come here for happy hour twice a week cuz we can walk here. So, yeah it's pretty convenient... but we STAY here after hours to play poker because the servers know us by name and the food is priced right and the poker crowd is really cool and it's a great place to eat-n-learn.And we LOVE Tony because that guy says hello to EVERY CUSTOMER EVERY TIME. Trust me on this one... jump off the freeway for happy hour... you'll know what I mean when Tony says hello to you, too.PS get the three meat calzone. You look great and can afford the calories...
other I've been to other Pei Wei's in the valley and I've yet to see any as busy as this one. The food is consistently good; do expect about a 20 minute wait for food if you are dining in. They recently got the new Coke touch machines where you can make your own flavor combo! YUM! This place can get noisy; I wouldn't recommend bringing kids since this place is very hectic and can be overwhelming to small children. Take Out is stellar and most of the time food is ready when promised.
other I love the outdoor space at this restaurant. We had a very friendly waiter serve us. We started out with a delicious gin cucumber cocktail which was so refreshing. For an appetizer we had the chicken arugula flatbread that was tasty but definitely could of used a bit more flavor. The caesar salad made with kale was so salty that we were not able to eat much of it. The romaine salad was okay, nothing special. The entree, halibut was so dry it was totally inedible. The roasted vegetables were just so-so. I ate here in December and loved it but this time I was very disappointed. I am in no hurry to return, except for a drink.
other I'm pretty sure these bagels have never seen boiling water, and to be honest they reminded me of nothing so much as the tragic frozen failbagels of my childhood.  I guess our first warning should have been the exceptionally alarming "CAPPUCCINO" poster in the window, showing what appeared to be (coffee?) chocolate milkshakes with whipped cream and chocolate. :(Two stars because it was, technically, an edible bagel, though my husband and I only managed to each finish half of ours.
other With quaint accommodations, friendly staff and interesting selection of food choices, I was able to forgive, and forget, that the Centurion didn't yet have a liquor license. The Centurion is a cozy (and by cozy, I mean small) place. But it has personality and I can imagine myself hanging out on the patio after work - in cooler weather. For those vegetarians out there, Centurion offers a diverse selection choices. For our lunch, my companion and I split a Heirloom Tomato (with Brie) Panini and the Shitake Spinach Risotto.  Both were flavorful. And the prices are quite reasonable at $8/each. The menu offers a diverse selection which includes burgers, pizza, pasta, salads (all around $9) and some higher priced dinner entrees (ranging from $23-$42). I hope to return to try their dinner entrees, the blue cheese crusted filet mignon sounds wonderful! I feel like I had fallen upon a hidden neighborhood gem. I'm crossing my fingers for their liquor license!
other I found this place in Yelp, so I at least started with some optimism ;) I wasn't disappointed. Great portions and plenty of variety. Got egg rolls, mu shu pork, house low mein,  Mongolian beef, rice and other fortune cookies, soy sauce, and hotmustard for about $30 plus tip. Plenty of leftovers after stuffing myself ;)  Everything tasted as expected, though the egg rolls and Mongolian beef were better than most... Not crazy great, but really good for take out/delivery. Now if they only made Chinese turkey for Christmas!!
other It was family day (the ex and I like to see our son smile) and we were starving... after driving around for a while we pulled up to Arriba's and said "what the hell..."That's also what we said when some of the food came, as in "what the hell is this??"So positive first.  The server was pretty quick and he gave refills without being asked.  Chips and salsa were good.  Chips were warm and salsa had a nice (suprising) kick.  Kick... do I sound like an old lady? Morgan and I ordered fish tacos and beef tacos, respectively, so we could swap one for one.  Fish was ok... nothing spectacular... but honestly I would rather pay for one at freakin Del Taco or Rubios.  Not worth it here.  Rice was ok, some flavor, probably converted rice though.  Beans were... blended?  I dunno about you but I like to see some actual BEANS in my beans!  This stuff was like brown goo... YUMMMMMMMM... :PThe beef taco was just weird.  I swear to God is tasted like gyro meat!  WTF?  I couldn't eat much of it.  Last but not least, Dom ordered the White Sands Chimichanga.  That sh*t looked nasty to be honest.  Covered with some gooey white sauce, filled with pork.  LOL, he said it tasted like hot dog.  Um, yikes!  He took about other bites and was "full".  A.K.A., he didn't like it.I also had a margarita... it was HUGE and didn't taste very good.  I'd rather have one 1/other that size that tasted nice.  Oh well.One star for the chips and salsa.  Like I said, the fish taco was okay, but every thing was just way over-priced!  Final verdict?  We decided to NEVER go there again.
other This place used to be amazing.  My favorite memories of past years is going to this seafood place with my parents.  It's not the same anymore.We went for my wife's 30th birthday.  My dad decided to join us.  My wife ordered steak and shrimp, my dad ordered steak, I ordered a crab stuffed lobster.  I have had the crab stuffed lobster many times before.  I was craving it.We got our appetizer's.  Dad got snails, wife and I shared steamers.  My dad was happy with the snails.  But then again, how can you go wrong with snails doused in garlic and butter?  The steamers were steamed little neck clams in a garlic broth.  It was not long neck clams like the rest of the world calls steamers.  I wasn't about to argue with the server that these are the wrong clams.The food came and for the first time in my life I was asking the server to take back my meal before I even tried it.  It looked dry and over cooked.  I told the server I've had this dish many times before and this is not the way it's supposed to be.  He told me this is what it's supposed to look like and begged me to try it.  I took one bite and I couldn't even swallow it because it was so dry.  Of course the server was gone by this point and didn't come back for 10 minutes to ask me how it was.While I was waiting for the server to return, I told my family I was just going to get the steak.  They just shook their head and told me not to.  I took one bite of my dad's steak and spat it out.  How do you screw up steak this bad?  It tasted like beef jerky and butter.  My dad and wife would have complained too, but it's my wife's birthday and I am already stealing her thunder.  I swapped my meal out for a steamed lobster.  How do you screw up a steamed other 1/other lobster?  Fortunately, that came out fine.So we left hungry and $300 poorer.  I used to not mind paying the money they charged but now, it is not worth it.  I am really hoping people stop coming here so they can just close down.
other Finally! A non-corporate place in Chandler that doesn't try too hard, yet knows how to please with high-end ingredients: local and organic when possible!I ordered the Chef's Burger from their lunch menu. Grass-fed, ground in-house 8 oz burger with arugula, Gruyère, and onion rings.  I personally would have liked the arugula melted under the Gruyère or tossed with the Russian dressing.  It was too ordinary undressed on the top bun. But, it IS the Chef's Burger and if that's how he likes it, then that's the way it should be enjoyed. Oh, and the onion rings are awesome.  The service was genuine and friendly. The food came out reasonably fast and HOT!It would have been nice if you could hear the music...it was just too quite.I will definitely come back and try other menu options and I highly recommend BLD!!
3 The Good: We absolutely love their wings and its becoming a regular for us to go every other Tuesday for their wing deal. We always get the honey hot wings and share a side of either regular fries or the loaded fries.The Bad: I do feel the wings are a bit too pricey, even on the deal days. Also, what is up with their high school hostesses!? They are incredibly rude and give dirty looks every single time we have gone, which is now around 7 times. Someone really needs to put these girls in check. Goodness. This is the reason for 3 stars instead of 4. I would actually give it 3.other stars if I could.We like the atmosphere and it always seems clean and the servers have been very nice so far.
other We found a bandaid with the panang.  We ordered panang with chicken, not panang with bandaid. When we told the waiter, he argued that it wasn't a bandaid.  I'm sorry, there's no mistaking a bandaid!  The icing on the cake was that they charged us for it!!!If you like bandaid on your dish, this I the place to go!Too bad yelp doesn't allow 0 stars. This place definitely was a ZERO.
other Tried a little if everything.  The bars are worth the drive across town unbelievably good.  The bars have a moist short bread crust, it is absolutely addictive.  The strawberry cupcake was perfection.  Cookies were very good but the bars and cup cakes stole the show.  Thank heavens it is not closer to home :)
other Why do you bring in the best bands and then torture me?Parking is freaking ridiculous, at least I have been enough times to know to leave my car on Mill and walk.Your security people are a bunch of freaking jerks who take their power wayyyy to seriously - take off my shoes? What kind of weapon or drugs can I be hiding in my open toed other inch heels?Your sound SUCKS - seriously sucks. For all the fees you charge on top of tickets - buy some new speakers already.The bathrooms are grossDrinks are reasonable so you get other stars (Watch out for the glass walls leading to the patio if you have overindulged in booze.. I've heard they are easy to run in to).
other Total bait and switch sales department! Will tell you one price over the phone, then quote you another when you arrive! Happened to me personally 3 times. I bought from Scottsdale BMW. One quote, one price, done deal. Buyer beware...
other freaking huge portions. the sandwiches are super yummy. the french toast, covered in bananas, and that crumbly sugary delicouisness is to die for...and you might unless you jog 10 miles afterwards. but the real treat is the desert counter...oh my god, even to just look at it is an honor. good bang for the buck.
other Ok so I get the peanut thing, wood accented atmosphere, good service (although rather "in your face" at times) and the packed dining room / bar even on a Thursday night. What I don't get is the awful food. This was my FIRST (and last) visit into this franchise restaurant. How they convinced franchisees and the general public to invest and vote with hard earned dollars is beyond me.I took my friends 1other year old there after he played in a b'ball game and after looking at the menu and pricing decided to split the rib eye special $19.99. I got the fried pickle appetizer as well and was sorely disappointed in the batter and both of the "dipping sauces" (watery ranch and thousand island? I really couldn't tell).  Even a franchise like H***ers makes them WAY better......wow.On to the main course. The baked potato with butter and cream cheese was overcooked or something? I have never had a potato that seemed to have been soaked in some type of brine and then baked? Kind of par boiled or something. Anyway the color was greyish and the taste like that of a fishy sea salt.Moving to the broccoli i was greeted by a palor yellow looking presentation. I couldn't tell if it was cheesy cauliflower or ? Wow the taste was again that of something really overcooked or under matured...YICKThe last chance at redemption came with the medium well rib eye. Good sized portion and easily split between the two of us 20oz. Good wholesome beefy taste and great texture only to be squallored  by a heavy Saltiness....not sure where this was picked up from but maybe by hanging out too close to the potato? I really am normally an amicable restaurant patron but after forking over $46 including tip for two to split some food and getting served what we did ...well you get my drift.Signed, NeverToStepFoot-InsideTheRoadhouseAgain
other ZERO stars!I traveled from STL to SFO a few weeks ago (with a layover in PHX). I have a couple complaints;One, I was checking other pieces of luggage in STL. One ended up being 14lbs. over weight (it was a cooler with food I bring home each year from my dad). I was charged an additional $90 on top of the $3other initially for the cooler to ship (including the $2other for my first bag- so $150 total)! This is an OUTRAGEOUS additional charge! I thought overweight bags were charged an additional $2other like other airlines I've had to pay at but $120 to ship one bag is just insane (and a set price for overweight bags is NOT listed on your website)! On top of that I paid $250 for a pet ticket so my baggage fees were $400 total... $100 more than my round trip ticket to fly. I couldn't believe that!On another note, the woman agent helping me at STL was the most rude customer service agent I've ever dealt with anywhere! She was rude to me about the overweight baggage and then claimed my dog was too tall to fit in her carrier so she claimed she wouldn't allow her to fly. She raised he voice at me and called me "a very inhumane person" for making a dog ride like that for a whole flight; seriously making me cry. I fly all over the country to do shows with my dog and this has never been a problem, including on the first leg of my trip when I bought the round trip dog ticket in SFO. This woman name-calling was totally inappropriate... people in line beside me were astonished. Since I had my round trip dog ticket purchased already, and she was sick of fighting with me over it, she let me go but told me the gate person probably wouldn't let me on the flight (and of course the gate person did).Between the dog crate episode and the bags, I have never been treated so poorly and charged with such ridiculously high adage fees. I'm very disappointed to not be able to fly US Air anymore since I never had problems with them in the past. It was a horrible way to end a very nice holiday vacation.I have passed the word on to as many people and websites as possible not to fly this airline!
other Wow. The food and atmosphere here are great. The music was a little too loud, but, for a weekend away, this place hit the spot perfectly. The wait was rather lengthy, so we stalked the bar until some folks left, then had our dinner there. I had the largest shrimp cocktail of my life, some really good wine, and grilled asparagus. There are so many delicious options in Scottsdale, but, this is pretty specific in vibe. Check it out.
other Nello's is the best!  Great local feel, great food, love this place.You have to have:  (Gluten Free) Pizza, Garden Salad with Turkey and House Dressing.  It will soon be your go to feel good order.
other Great quality food, atmosphere, and location. This is a place to take a date to or just to have an enjoyable evening with great food. The meatloaf (When they have it) is amazing. Steak is also top ofthe line.. Definitely recommend..
other My husband and I have Been meaning to go in here and see if it was anything like hong kong gourmet, so yesterday for lunch we decided to give it a try. Huge mistake! The food was literally inedible, everything was either too cold or burnt to a char, nothing tasted good. We decided to try the desert and the cream puff (I'm unsure how you can mess that up) was petrified and the cream was so gross I spit it out. The smell of the flan actually made us gag, we had such an awful time I complained to the manager. She didn't even seem to care, and gave us 20% off of a lunch we didn't even eat. We were disgusted by this place, and we will never, ever go back. Don't do it, you will regret it!
other One of our favorite pizzas in the Phoenix-area. Well... definitely my husbands. He LOVES, LOVES, LOVES Grimaldi's. We always get the same pizza. Every.Single.Time. Large pizza -- pepperoni, sausage, and red onion. (That way we can have leftovers the next day - - and I'm not a leftover person.)SO good!This location has more outdoor seating than the one in Chandler. Plus they have another side room/building that is great for private parties.
other I went with my sister other days ago. It was my first time eating Famous Dave's. I got a hamburger and got some mac & cheese. They were both okay, I tasted better. Now the hot wings & onion rings were better. the place was packed we sat outside.
other OK, Sweet Pea and I love us some Coup, and it's not just because we've been coming here for years- since I lived across the street and could see the restaurant from my window- or because we got engaged here (which was incredible.)  It's because the food never disappoints.  You can go to restaurants and have varying experiences from the best meal of your life to terrible, but Coup is not the place for that.  It's consistent.  And consistent can be good, or bad.As consistently good as the food is, the service is likewise consistently slow (albeit friendly).  We went here for Valentine's day which we've been several times and I highly recommend.  It's romantic without being showy.  They have a special Valentine's Day set menu of other courses which is always interesting and good.  And, if you go on the day before Valentine's Day, they still have the menu, but it's cheaper.  Damn those greeting card "holidays".  The menu is also consistent.  The outstanding things are the brie brulee which is an absolute must-try as an appetizer, and the lamb shank.  Everything else is solidly good without being great.  The desserts are exceptional.  I like the BYOB aspect of the restaurant, although, they do charge you a lot for "corking fees", which amount to just charging you for nothing since they have a corkscrew sitting on the table and you are in charge of opening your own bottle.Coup, I love you.  You get other stars if you vary your menu a little, please, please, please get more vegetarian (if any vegetarian) options, and improve your service.
other I should have done this so long ago, but we forget our Doctor's need reviews too! I've sent my boyfriend, my family and my friend's to her. You should know about her too! I've been going to Dr. Bradley for 10 years! She is my all time favorite doctor because she is always bright, smiling, genuine and just overall warm! You want to thank her and hug her at the same time. Her staff is professional and friendly. Mandy at the front desk is wonderful at her job. I've followed Dr. Bradley to other locations and would never think of going anywhere else. She's helped me with everything from migraines to pnuemonia to well woman check ups to getting my gall bladder removed! What a versatile and knowledgeable woman she is! I take my son to her now and he isn't afraid to go in. Peace of mind knowing we will be treated well, and taken care of is all I could really ask for in a general doctor!
other Had the Arizona Smashburger with SmashFries, Fried Pickles, Chili, and an Oreo Shake. Yeah yeah so much for my diet. I guess today is my Smash-Cheater-Day. The Burger was good, the Habenareos Cheese, Guacamole, and Chipotle Mayo were good. The burger was not greasy at all. The 1/2lb. burger was much bigger than the bun. The pickles were a little salty, but very good and something one does not get to try all the time. The Chili is Steak Chili, very dark, no beans, with Jalapenos & Cheese. The Oreo Shake was Haagen-Dazs with real Oreos...very tasty! The place was clean, restrooms clean, and staff very friendly. Overall a good time.
other I used Harvil's Auto Body after a fender bender. They were one of the auto body places that was included in State Farm's program. They were efficient, friendly, proactive, highly-responsive, and helpful. I especially appreciated that they kept me updated on the progress of my automobile and advocated for me/my vehicle when needed. This level of high-quality customer services is hard to come by. If you have a choice, choose Harvil's. You won't be disappointed.
other Very excited to try this place out.  I tried the sampler of all other beers and really enjoyed them all; however, the watermelon ale was my favorite.  Great service, cool, relaxed atmosphere and delicious beer = a winner!
other Great prices, great food. The staff is very friendly... I'll definitely be coming back here for lunch on a more regular basis. I had the kung pao, and the portions were incredible for the $other I paid. Not mind blowing, but better than most Chinese places I've been to in the Valley.
other Price to performance is pretty stellar. For $110/night I enjoyed a large room with a luxurious bathroom, balcony, and cool retro furnishings. Service was decent, but the W Scottsdale is better on this front. Breakfast at their restaurant was basic but worked. Stylings from the lobby to the furniture in your room is really well done, the hotel has a great boutique-y vibe but without the pretentiousness. The location is good, only minutes from downtown Scottsdale. One snafu while I was there... I sent out some dry cleaning that was supposed to be back by 5:30pm, didn't happen. It was a stressful half hour before they found my stuff (all cleaned, phew!).
other St. Francis gives the impression you could be dining in one of the finest cities in the world, instead of the 5th largest cities in the USA.Start with their cucumber gin drink, and then order another.  Goat cheese on crostini follows.  Insist on extremely memorable whipped potatoes--a side order-- to accompany your salmon on red quinoa.  Dessert MUST be the chocolate cake with peanut butter gelato accompanied by carmel sauce trailings and carmel corn garnishes.Try dining at the bar for an uncluttered view out the picture window opening, minus the glass.Loved it!  Will happily return.They split our entree for us AND were gracious about the extra trouble we caused--not a wimper.  Truly superior service !
other My husband and I went there for our first time today. What a mistake. First of all, the ladies bathroom had no soap or paper towels to wash/dry your hands. My husband had the steak sandwich and I had the chicken ranch. There was so little meat on the sandwiches that we were perplexed when we were finished.  The inside trash was overflowing. I have been sick to my stomach the last hour....never again.
other It's difficult to find good bagels in Scottsdale, so my roommate and I ventured to Tempe to satiate our cravings.We both got the open-faced bagel, cream cheese and lox.  It was excellent and fresh.  The bagel was chewy without being too bread-like.  The lox was fresh and high quality.  I will definitely be back.
other Had lunch with my Husband here today, we sat outside, it was gorgeous weather, the food is really Great, good variety, of ethnic foods !!!  Not bad for the price !!!
other I was not happy with the service department.  Service writer had a poor attitude towards helping me.  Repair work was done well and on budget but it is sad how a greeter can sour you on the whole place.
other This place has had awesome bread since day one. Whatever else you walk out with is just a bonus. Actually, I have to say that the produce selection is getting noticeably better each time I walk in. I still don't think it's quite suitable for everyday shopping, but it's coming along pretty well.
other More a comment than a review. Suffice it to say, I L-O-V-E this store! Much to my surprise and delight they are opening a second store at 75th and Cactus! Right in my own backyard , don't ya know. Woo hoo! Now all we need for the NW valley is Lee's sandwiches, and a solid dim sum joint to complete my favorite Asian trifecta!!
other I'm so sad I didn't discover the Herb Box sooner. I went for a girl's lunch and was blown away - by the decor, the vibe, the view and the food - and this was during the winter. I can't wait for patio weather because this will become a weekend go-to spot for me. The salads and sandwiches are delicious and the fries and chips - holy moly! They're amazing and you'll get tons of them. The decor is perfectly shabby chic with a traditional twist and I could seriously move in. If you and your mom and girlfriends love the quaint feel of Arcadia Farms, give Herb Box a whirl. It's got the same feel, but more modern. Love love love it.
other One of my new favorite neighborhood bars! We had a Canada Day shindig here and it's a great little neighborhood bar with fair drink prices and super friendly bar staff. You'd never know that there's a bar inside when you get to the parking lot behind the Ice Rink - just look for the signs on the top of the building. They have lots of TVs for hockey fans and the bar looks right out onto the ice so you can watch people skate. They had a great jukebox and the Rockband kit so you can rock out with all your newest bar friends. For food selection you have BBQ, BBQ, or BBQ...either beef, pork, or chicken, with a side for $6.50. Tasty stuff! Great beer selection including Molson Canadian or Labatt Blue.
other Glorified Applebee's. I think they want the yard of beer to cover the lack luster food & services.
other I live in a town where I can find other Filipino restaurants in a other mile radius. So when I came to Phoenix for work, I wanted to see what the Filipino restaurant scene was like.Like the previous reviewer stated, there are very few Filipino eateries. The supermarket that I found on my GPS was closed, so I found this one on Yelp. Overall, I would recommend to go to support the local Filipino restaurant.When you first walk in, you start in the bake shop area where you'll find cakes and pastries on display. I wasn't sure if I could seat myself, but I was greeted and seated. There were two other tables filled with about 8 people eating including myself. What concerned me is that other of the other folks were the only other Filipinos - as I tend to judge all ethnic restaurants by the number of people of the same ethnicity.But that logic doesn't seem to work here were the demographics of Filipinos seems relatively low.I was craving Sisig (grilled pork - which is my favorite at Ongpin in South San Francisco) - but they didn't have that. On the whiteboard, they had Sinigang na Baboy (pork) - so I figured I couldn't go wrong with one of my favorites.Since I was here on business, I figured I'll order a few other things including the shanghai lumpia (eggrolls), Halo Halo, and topped it off with Hot Pandesal.The Sinigang was served in a bowl with 3 pieces of boneless pork. The meat was very tender and you can pull it apart with a spoon and fork. The soup was a little on the salty side since they may have put a little more tamarind mix, but that I might just be a little oversensitive about my sodium intake.I couldn't help but think that I was eating at home or a family friend's house. Included in the sinigang was spinach, string beans, eggplant, a small potato, and cut onions. What was missing was dikons (those white radish things). It wasn't bad, and it wasn't exceptionally delicious because nothing compares to home made sinigang. But this would be the next best thing. I ate all the meat, and had quite a few eggplants left.The shanghai lumpia came out shortly afterwards. The portion was pretty large and I could have shared it with someone else. I didn't care for sauce that it came with. I wanted vinigar, but a filipino family came in and there was only one server.If you ever had Halo Halo at Ongpin, you'd find this lacking. It is served it a large plastic cup. What was missing is the ube ice cream. In fact, there was hardly any ube in it. There was a spoonfull of the leche flan, but I didn't finish it.I actually ordered the Pandesal later, this version was like two very large dinner rolls served with butter. The bread had a fresh out of the oven taste.The restaurant section was clean, with standard fare dining. There was a large flatscreen tv with TFC playing.Last week, when I ate there, they were just written about in the local paper, but I didn't get to read the review.They accept Master Card and Visa, but not American express.I would eat here again to try some of their other dishes not because I want to support my fellow Filipinos, but because the food is actually worth having again. I took some photos of each dish with my iPhone, so I'll have to figure out how to upload them.This is actually my first review because I was hoping to read more about Philippine restaurants in the area, I only saw this one. So I figured, I should also contribute!
3 I've been coming here for a little over a year and I can't say that I've ever been really all that impressed.  Yes, they "hand wash" your car but I feel like that's the only pro on the actual cleaning of my car.  I've never really been happy with the vacuuming, not sure that they really do anything other than the mats.  When I get in my car all the old fuzz and hair is still on the seats.  The last other times I've been there they've missed cleaning parts of my car and I have to say something.  The last time they cleaned 3 out of other of my tires, even a stranger commented to me about how he found it odd they missed it.  Also, asked for air freshener and when I got in my car it still smelled like ummm, well it didn't smell fresh and clean.  I just left there and again I had to ask them clean the inside door.  It was covered in dirt and dead grass, how do you miss that?!? When I called someone over to clean it he then noticed that the wind shield was still dirty.  I mean, really?? And again, no air freshener even though I asked for it.I gave 3 stars instead of other because I do appreciate the fact that this is not a chain.  I'd rather give my money to a family owned spot instead of some corporate junk.   The tall, blonde woman who greats you is always very nice and helpful.  I like that I'm not hounded about getting my windshield or cracks fixed a million times and sometimes they offer deals on LivingSocial which is great. Overall I feel like this is a good place to come and just have the surface of your car washed unless you want to pay big bucks to actually see a difference in the inside of your car.  Make sure you check your car before leaving to ensure they have actually cleaned everything.
other I used to shop her constantly when I live right across the street and I still make the drive up there, even though the prices are higher than Safeway. Why?-The staff rocks. Need a certain type of wine? They know where to find it. Need a spice? That's covered too. Every employee is courteous, and most importantly, SPEAKS FLUENT ENGLISH.-Their deli rocks my socks. Always fresh and always tasty, I've purchased more than a few dinners and have never been disappointed.-The ready to cook stuff is delicious too. In the mood for some kind of meat stuffed with a vegetable and/or cheese? This is the place.-I also loved the fresh food cooked every day right in the store. From BBQ to MASSIVE Sunday omelets, the choices are a plenty. Again, not cheap, but you certainly get your money's worth. Go early if you want the breakfast, they run out quick.And you can buy good beer by the bottle! Dogfish Head rocks.
other Wow. I forgot that libraries existed. Until recently, when I wanted to get some travel guides for an upcoming European vacation. Then I thought, hmm... maybe a library would be a good idea. So I visited the Mesa library on my lunch hour and I was amazed at all the great books they have there. Seriously, there were all these brand-new, just-released hardcovers just sitting on tables, waiting for me to pick them up.I remember being a teenager and having to wait MONTHS to get new books. Now, apparently, because either a) no one reads or b) no one uses libraries or c) both, new books are readily available at the library. Well, good news for me.I also think the Mesa library may be a great place to pick up decent books because most of the patrons seem to be really, really old or homeless and possibly illiterate. I'm not trying to be snarky, it's just something that's quite clear from the moment you walk in.Overall, however, this is a very nice, well-stocked library. And you can even keep renewing your books on-line. Thanks to the Mesa library, I just  may make it to the Yelp book club meeting  this weekend... !
other Having lived in Mesa and delivered sub sandwiches to some of the tweekiest of tweakers, I don't feel any shame in admitting that whole area now resides in a dead zone for me. When I get that itch to go out and tear up the town, waste away a lazy afternoon, or enjoy a nice dinner, I think of places north, south and west of Tempe. It's like my brain has one of those little electric dog collar things attached to it, and when I start to stray too far east, it gives me a subliminal zap so I erase Mesa from the map in my mind.So naturally, Stray Cats is usually a place I visit when meeting up with others who have suggested it. Thing is, I always end up having a pretty good time when I go there. The drinks are priced reasonably and generally on the strong side, the bartenders are friendly and quick to serve. The music is pretty good, but I've never been here when a DJ's spinning. I used to like the fact that there was an air conditioned smoking room off to the side with plush couches and big televisions. The crowd is always diverse, friendly and easy to engage in slurred conversation.It just doesn't have any special oomph for me. I'd much rather frequent Hollywood Alley a couple miles south, where there's pool and live music. Unfortunately it's also on the black list of Mesa, so maybe I should find a way to reverse that programming. It's not just tweakers and mormans, it's not just tweakers and mormons, it's not just tweakers and mormons....
other What can I say... I am a bargain shopper! I'm not cheap, but I get more satisfaction out of getting a bargain than I do spending a ton of money for a name brand item at Nordstrom or Sax Fifth. That being said, sure you can find a pair of shoes you'll like here, but the selection is simply OK, and its usually full retail price. Most of the time they have a two-for-one deal or get the second pair half price. Still, its never really any kind of sweet deal.
other I was reluctant to try this shop at first.  Some of the reviews that popped up via Google lead me to believe it unpleasant and not well-stocked.  Well, you can fool some of the people some of the time, and today, I was no longer fooled by whatever weird people out there have it in for Double Joy Beads.Firstly, their Czech seed beads are the cheapest in town.  I'm not even kidding.  I purchased six half tubes and one full for around $10.  The organization thereof leaves something to be desired, but at those prices, browsing should be a joy.  Their pressed glass and fire polished selections were of average number and price.  In the Swavorski department, standard bicones, cubes and rounds are not available as singles- only some of the pendant materials, and even then, some come packed two to a bag.  I was a bit vexed by this.  What if someone wants one Baroque for a pendant?The back sported a nice assortment of findings and stringing materials.  Particularly impressive: a display of natural copper items ready for raiding.  Sales bins occupied the front- some bags currently up for less than a quarter.  I found the clerk on duty during my visit was more of the hands-off type, but quite personable when I checked out.  The store itself is a bit hard to find, tucked in a winding strip mall.  It's directly across the street from Arizona Art Supply.  That street is Scottsdale Road, but if you can see the art store from the side where Double Joy abides, you can't be far.
other Truly a great owner who cares about his customers!   I highly recommend a visit if you like one of a kind, quality pieces....young, yet classic, tasteful, yet funky.  "
other Intimate ambiance with good farm to table fare. Good presentation and wine pairings. Outdoor area is nice, though as others have pointed out, there's basically no lighting back to the parking lot after dark.
other What an exciting time.  I am writing my first YELP review about the wonderful MOJO Yogurt  I visited yesterday afternoon.   There were so many wonderful flavors to choose from and the people there were nice enough to pass out tiny little sample cups.  It was a challenge narrowing down my selections to a few flavors but I somehow managed.  I ended up with Birthday Cake (that's right, there is Birthday Cake flavored yogurt, life IS good), Cafe Latte, and the divine Original Tart.  After throwing on a few gummy bears I was a happy girl.  I see in other reviews that some complained about pricing but I am willing to pay a little extra for quality and happiness.
other What can I say I love AJs especially the Boulangerie or coffee bar.  Jason is the best.   The pineapple ice tea with a slice of pineapple is deli-sh with a yummy cheese croissant.  I admit I usually get something from the coffee bar and bistro more so than the actual grocery store.  Oh and if you go check out the display/decorations they are usually pretty cool.
other Simply put this place is AWESOME.  If you're looking to start a business or already own a business but need some of the details on a particular area, this is the place to be.  So far I've only attended a Brown bag lunch but I was thoroughly impressed by the people who were there. However, don't show up with out being ready to put in your two cents, its needed to keep the ball going, I thought it was really good.  I can't wait to go back!
other I have to admit that I can't stop going to Carly's even though I KNOW I shouldn't!  Good:  I can't get enough of the Cape Cod salad! It is really somethin' special, that ain't no lie.  Also the soup is always flavorful.Bad: Has nothing to do with the food. It is all about the atmosphere, which is oppressive in an I'm-so-unique-and-talented-and-you-are-smelly-dung sort of way. Staff is pretentious and lazy. They think they must be pretty lofty individuals for working there but that doesn't mean they LIKE to work, for god's sake....  The owner. She is somewhat friendly, but beware. She is the person who created this environment, and it becomes easy to believe once she starts bragging about how well-off she is.  So congratulations everyone! We support these immature little weasels who scorn this gross human ritual we indulge ourselves in: being a customer, AND apparently we have made the owner a rich woman but shhhhhh! She's still the kewlest of the kewl.UPDATE: Received an annoying email from the owner (the husband) who instructed me give " *constructive criticism* " and not make a personal attack or be petty. My review was neither of those things. I do not know John, nor do I know Carla. I only know what I experience when I have lunch at their place of business. The staff was rude and lazy. The owner DID brag. The food I always order is good. Get a grip buddy.I was honest about my experience for OTHER PEOPLE who are considering spending their cash on food there.  I am not in the least concerned about the owners or the staff personally, but apparently John thinks I ought to be.  I ought to see how great Carla is. In fact, he goes into detail about how great Carla is.  It's nice to witness a man standing up for his lady. It would almost cause me to add a star up there, but sorry, no can do.  His improper use of the possessive apostrophe SEVERAL times canceled that out (okay, now that was petty -my bad).  I'd advise John to concentrate on things other than trolling around yelp, chastising his own customers, whose business supports that fancy paint and the famously zombie-like staff.  Maybe the staff is just following John's lead when they don't focus on creating a positive experience for their customers?Honestly, I remain puzzled as to why John would bother to bother me.  I go into a small restaurant to find the owner bragging. That is part of my experience and I will continue to post reviews featuring owners, and how they carry themselves.As for the "personal attack" on Carla, I will not retract what I said just because John is butthurt and whines about it. I will say this: Carla has probably been in the restaurant several of the many times I have dined there, but I perceived the bragging only one time. I doubt anyone who read my review would label this person a braggart based on that one experience of mine, and as I said before- it did not and would not stop me from going back.I will be back. I will order the food and enjoy the food, but since that's not the only part of the dining experience, I will tolerate the negative things because the food I regularly order is consistently good.
other What a place!  I recently hosted a 25-person family party there, and both the food and service were impeccable.  The staff were all very friendly and accommodating, even with the dozen children we had in the group.  Leslie was the manager and she paid attention to every last detail, helping me to plan the menu and gauge food quantities for that many people.  The restaurant itself was spotless, from the outside patio down to the restrooms.  Thanks for making our family event such a wonderful success.  Everyone left full and happy.  We will definitely be back!!
other I haven't been in a while but I remember being impressed.  Nice ambiance, especially for a Thai restaurant.
other Stopped by for a quick bite on a Saturday afternoon. Did not realize that the place had just opened (or at it appeared that way). Quite crowded with patrons, a bubble machine, and a DJ. It was bit loud with all the commotion, but still within reason. The menu is compact, but offered all the usual suspects. I went for the Pulled Pork sandwich with a side of cole slaw. I dumped the cole slaw on top of the pork and went to town on the sandwich. Meat was moist and smoky. The sauce had a hint of of kick. Very tasty.The service was a bit slow, but the place was pretty much full up so I expected it to take a bit of time.Good joint. Would return.
other I finally tried out Valle Luna on Sunday.  I must say that the food is authentic and one of the better Mexican restaurants in the Valley.  The salsa and chips are homemade and simply tasty.  I had the fish tacos that were fried and came with cabbage and soft shells - delicious.The waitress that served me was attentive.  I must say that the seating did take a while and I was one of two people in line, hence no five star here.  The portions were decent, the tacos could have had more fish in them.Overall I am pleased with the restaurant and you will be too.
other Yeah, its BBB....what else to say?
other Went on a Saturday night using our Entertainment coupon (which listed old address, had to call for new, they gave a nice apology). There was a party going on behind screens, all Pakistanis, women & girls in traditional wear, balloons, lots of children that were literally running though the restaurant, squealing with delight. Very glad we were not expecting a romantic dinner... We approached it as cultural diversity, chose to enjoy the loud, festive atmosphere. OK... A little annoyed when one of the little girls did a few particularly high-pitched repeated squeals, & one kid bumped my chair as they chased each other across the restaurant...It was less than an hour of closing, so we asked if the buffet was not such a good idea (been out a while, no fresh coming). The kid waiter went to ask, and we appreciate that he returned reporting that the menu would be a better choice to insure quality. Ordered lentil soup & sesame naan (new & listed on back pages). Lentil soup was soft yellow color, not darker lentils I'm used to. It was creamy with very small pieces of lentils. The flavor was more mild than I'm used to, but a subtle spicy. It was nice, no complaints. The sesame naan was fresh, crisp bottom, soft top layer, added a bit of salt and WOW delicious!! Lots of sesames on top, yum.Then ordered chicken tikka masala, as I'm working my husband into such foods, and he for sure likes this dish. Nice white breast meat which he prefers, simmered in that divine red creamy sauce. I'd call it mild heat at best. I'd prefer a bit spicier, but perfect for my husband. We brought our beverage with us, after calling to make sure it was okay. Nothing is mentioned on the website one way or the other. They were very accommodating for this, brought us glasses, and offered an opener to use. I am under the impression there's a seating size limit to such places & not sure they don't exceed it, so I'm going to stay vague so they/we don't lose this option! It was GREAT - kept our bill nice and low.If it wasn't for the Entertainment coupon, we wouldn't have known to try them... Now we will be back!other stars not five because it was really good but not mind-blowing... It would take a big wow to have me give 5. Children thing doesn't affect score, as I know that was a celebration exception, and again chose to see it as a cultural experience. Omar works part-time, very nice, friendly, good customer service. He apologized for the chaotic environment, which was nice. Saw grumpy uncle at counter, no smile, but we didn't have any interaction with him. We were waited on mainly by a nice kid with puffy black hair, seemed a bit timid but did fine with everything. Omar came to us and chatted at the end of the evening.
3 It seems like dine-in theaters are popping up all over the Valley these days. Studio Movie Grill in north Scottsdale recently opened.The theater has a far less luxurious feel than the AMC Esplanade 1other or even iPic Theaters. Instead of comfy reclining seats, you're stuck sitting upright, and you won't get any blankets to keep you warm. The inside looks the most like a traditional theater that I've seen at a dine-in theater-and my companion mentioned the lobby reminded him of an airport, and the theater itself, a bowling alley.Like the other two places, though, ordering food or drinks from your server is as easy as pushing the button at your seat. They'll come and grab your order (the menu is full of American food, similar to AMC Esplanade 14), and they'll deliver it to you throughout the movie.Movie tickets are $9 Sunday-Thursday and $1other Friday's and Saturday's, which is way less expensive than iPic and around the same price at Esplanade. I heard people are arriving up to an hour early for weekend movies, so be warned.We drank and ate during the movie. We got a pitcher of domestic beer for $15, which I thought was a good deal considering the two of us drank two beers each from it. For food, I ate a grilled cheese sandwich ($6.25), which came with French fries. I actually really liked this grilled cheese sandwich, since the bread was thick and there was lots of cheese, and the seasoned fries were thickly cut and tasted great. Some regular movie theater concession stand items at non-dine-in theaters are just as expensive, so I thought the food prices here were really reasonable.Though the food and prices were satisfactory, based on the less comfortable atmosphere, I'd still pick AMC Esplanade 1other out of the now three dine-in theaters I've tried.
other I love the Valley Ho! It's a beautiful property with great rooms, a fantastic pool, an excellent restaurant -- Trader Vic's and a really nice spa. Be sure to stay in the newly re-modeled Loft Suite. It's two stories and it's fantastic! If I was to take a stay-cation, I would be sure to stay at the Valley Ho! And for all you out-of-towner's who want to stay in Old Town Scottsdale and be close to great shopping, restaurants, and nightclubs, the Valley Ho should be at the top of your list!
other -Inexpensive produce.-Fresh sausage and other meats.-$2.99 freshly made to order sanwiches.-Decent prices, cheaper than Whole Foods.-Parking is convenient.-Employees in the produce dept not so friendly. -Cashiers are usually friendly.
other I went here with my husband last Sunday afternoon.  We had a other for other coupon out of the Entertainment guide.  We are from San Diego and have been trying to find Mexican food places similar to the food out in San Diego.  We pulled up to the location and were debating if we should go in or not.  The area wasn't the best, and it was in a tiny strip mall.  Kind of looked like a taco shop.  We decide to go in, because we were starving.  Inside it looked completely different.  It was a little dark and dated.  But the atmosphere was very causal and the hosts were super nice.  We sat down and right away got some nice warm chips, salsa and beans served to us.  I was feeling like a margarita and was going to get the house one, when the waitress said they had 99 cent margaritas available.  We ordered our food and didn't have to wait very long to get it.  Super good food and really cheap 99 cent margaritas. The margaritas were served in pretty nice size glasses but a bit strong.  FYI, I think you're getting really cheap alcohol in there, seemed pretty stiff. I started buzzing after my second glass.   My husband even loved the Chile reino that he tried from my plate.  He usually doesn't like it at all.  The carne asada was seasoned very well, it was a great change from some of the bland Mexican food I've had out here in phoenix. My husband had the beef chimichanga and it was seasoned really well also.  For the price you can't beat it.  From the outside the restaurant seems a little ghetto looking, but once you get inside it's pretty nice in there.  I would defiantly try it again.
other Everything about this company sucks. Walmart treats their customers and employees horribly, I mean HORRIBLY! They destroy the communities in which they sit. I'm done, never shopping here again, I don't care how cheap something might be, there is a high cost to low prices afterall...
other Like the other reviewers have said the service is really not that great.  Luckily they're saved the  really good food that they have.  We ordered so much food that our little two top table  couldn't possibly handle it all.  The mussels  might have been the best I've ever had. We also shared a Frito misto, which is really good except they're pretty chintzy with the shrimp they only gave us too.  The pastas were clearly handmade which appreciate and they're quite good. The owner came over to check on us a couple times which I appreciated.  I'm definitely coming back soon.
other Best beer selection in Arizona but the good features end there.  It's the only reason I return and put up with the following.  Service is often horrible, even during the day when there are few patrons.  Often you have to go up to the bar to order even when there is a server in your section.  It makes no sense that a mug of beer should be empty for more than 10 minutes before it is noticed.Food is subpar and wouldn't get such a pass from most people if this place didn't have the beer.  Prices are reasonable.  Website is often inaccurate re: what is actually on tap.
other Yes I do rock the hipster joints.  I dig this place.  A little bit of a scene, but the food is solid and the service is great. Hard not like it.  All in all a great spot.  I tend to switch up my favorites but I typically hit this up for breakfast when in the 602.
other I really love this place.  The girls that work there crack me up and they can get you in and out quicker than anywhere else in the Marketplace.  Their prices are decent and their food is great.  The orange chicken is some of my favorite.  This place is very much like Panda Express but thankfully doesn't have that terrible Panda flavor (eww, panda flavor).  Bri sums up this place pretty well.
3 You've seen the storyline play out many times - great athlete in his prime signs a multi-year mega-contract, but eventually his body betrays him and he's parked on the bench, getting paid more than the starters.Valle Luna, I'm looking at you.My family used to frequent this place - you could get a nice meal for $8 or $9 per person, and their food was fantastic.But Valle Luna has lost a step.  You see it here and there - the chimi sauce isn't quite the same, the beans are inconsistent, and the fundido just isn't as fun.  And to make matters worse, Valle Luna now demands superstar prices, asking for around $20 for a chimichanga dinner.  I hate to break this to you, guys, but I can get that - and done better - for much cheaper.  And don't even get me started on the rise of Rito's, Chipotle, and Juan's, all of which provide superior food for less than half the price.Their prices have become ridiculous - and I think Valle Luna knows it, because this is one of the only restaurants I can think of that creates a version of their menu WITH NO PRICES for their website.  I'm serious: http://www.valleluna.com/VL_Menu3.html  It looks exactly like the regular menu, just without any idea of how crazy expensive their food has become.  I suppose they figure that you can't (or won't) leave after you've sat down, ordered drinks, and eaten some chips?But much like that past-his-prime athlete, Valle Luna still has one move that reminds you of those glory days, like Jordan's fade-away jumper.  It was his best shot late in his career because it was the only shot he could cleanly get off.   Valle Luna's fried ice cream is so delicious, and since it's dessert, they can't charge $18 for it.   I wish I could tell you the exact price but that's censored on the online menu, too.   So go for dessert sometime soon and reminisce about the glory days, because I suspect it won't be long before the game passes Valle Luna by and they're forced to hang up the aprons.
other Came here with a bunch of the crew from work during lunch, and wow! This hidden gem on the corner of Indian School & 48th Street is a must visit if you're in the Arcadia area. The food here is amazing, and there's such a wide variety including delicious tater tots (even sweet potato tater tots) and the mouth watering reuben that I had chosen. You get a good sized portion as well. Thank goodness for take-home boxes! The restaurant is very spacious, and the staff is really friendly & laid back but get you seated and eating your food in no time. It gets better; the price of the food is VERY reasonable, in fact, I'm kind of shocked how inexpensive they are. A well deserved five stars!
other Great tire shop. I brought in my car because I kept losing air in a tire, they found a nail, removed it and patched the tire in 10 minutes flat. Very nice people, and very fair prices.
other Being the only gay bar in Scottsdale aside from BS West, I've found myself at Forbidden a few times.  Forbidden is an ambitious concept--a gay club with two rooms and two deejays in a city not known for its gay nightlife. Sadly Forbidden does not deliver.  The club is usually pretty busy on a Saturday night, but the crowd leaves a bit to be desired.  The patrons are mostly unattractive, kind of trashy in fact, and not very friendly.  I believe deejay in the main room does not change on the weekends, where he spins top 40 dance/pop to a drunk college-aged crowd.  In the OZ room (the smaller room) they have different local deejays, who, from what I've seen, spin a variety of different types of music--sometimes it's circuity music, sometimes it's eighties music, it all depends on the deejay for that night.  The OZ room has been pretty empty the few times I've been there.  The sound system in both rooms leaves quite a bit to be desired from a place that calls itself a club.  The drinks are reasonably priced for a bar in Scottsdale.   The décor is okay, but not very interesting.  Forbidden isn't terrible.  It is, however, just plain boring (bad music on a bad sound system, uninteresting décor, and an unimpressive and unfriendly crowd)!
other I recommend this to everyone.  I have never had a bad meal here.  Inexpensive, great service, off the beaten path. Love this place.
other Never had any complaints about this place, except it smells like death when you walk in. I've always been well taken care of when Im here.
other Step back into the 1990s and enjoy a workout! Nice clean facility. Equipment sort of jammed in at odd angles (in the large weight/cardio room) but its good stuff. Not sure the purpose of two weight rooms. I think the club is more tennis based yet they have do have group exercise classes, racquetball courts and a pool. I think the spinning room may have been a children's nursery at one time based on the wall graphics, the black light effect is unique. If this were my club I'd place the emphasis on spinning classes and convert the smaller weight room into a spinning studio. Dropped a star because the women's locker room doesn't have a sauna. Very friendly employees! I am so glad to be greeted with a smile when walking in the door. Everyone on the staff is friendly. Quaint club. . . in a good way.
other I have long been a fan of AJ's and lucky for me, they didn't open a location on the West Side of town until after I moved back to California. If they had, I would have been more broke then I was as a single working mother.The daughter and I stopped in before her hair appointment for some coffee and pastries and then I came back in once her hair was getting done. The first thing I did was order some iced tea from their coffee counter. It was absolutely delicious iced tea and very reasonably priced. I want that tea now, I think it was pineapple or something yummy. I perused around the store, picking up some Goldwater Salsa and a stuffed Cornish game hen to cook later in the day for my Grandma from the butcher counter. I was thrilled that they still had the stuffed fresh hens for the same price I used to pay $4.99. Something inflation hadn't touched.I also picked up some huge honey crisp apples (something again Grandma can afford but won't buy for herself) and a small bunch of flowers for her. Next time I am in town, I am going to hit up AJ's right away for some iced tea!
other PHENOMENAL place for Chinese cuisine. The portions are HUGE! My fiance and I always only order one thing and share it, and still always have leftovers. The menu prices are very reasonable. Including tip, we usually don't spend more than $1other for the both of us for dinner. They are very personable and attentive to your needs. I love that it is a very dainty, and has a very laid back atmosphere. The lemon chicken is our favorite!! :) They are also very kid friendly. We have an 18 month old son who always leaves a nice pile of rice on the floor every time we leave lol, but they love him! Highly recommend!
other Happened to be at the mall around 6:30pm and decided to go to Z'Tejas for dinner. It was a 2other min wait. Looked across the way and saw lots of open tables at Kona Grill. That ought to have registered as a red flag but since I was starving I guess my mental acuity was off. The hostess sat us in the back of the restaurant with a clear view of the hallway leading to the restrooms. We commented to our hostess that we were awful close to the restrooms. She chirped, yeah. End of discussion. I ordered a grey goose on the rocks, you know, vodka and ice in a glass. What I got back wasn't grey goose and it was mixed with soda, but it was in a glass though. My wife ordered a rib eye sandwich, medium. What she got was still breathing. My Korean chicken was almost warm but I attribute most of that to the spices. It was good but not great. I will say that our server was terrific and the manager did come by to check on us. This used to be a good spot but seems to be going through a transition period to become mediocre. Too bad.
other The Lodge has been a pretty consistent happy hour spot for me over the last year and a half. Their food and drink specials are a great way to wrap up the week on a Friday night. I like their chicken strips and the cheese curds are great. The pretzels are also delicious. Service is typically pretty good, you'll be able to keep drinks coming and food comes out quickly. There's a lot of entertainment there, with corn hole and giant jenga outside, and some video games and a pool table inside. I don't love the Lodge as much for a prime time or late night spot...It gets a lot more expensive and a lot more crowded. Go for happy hour, order some cheese curds and a $3 Miller Lite and you're bound to have a good time. The decor is kinda fun, there are random acts of taxidermy inside and it's very, uh...Log cabin like.A funny (but pretty well known) fact about this place is that Jared Allen (Minnesota Vikings) is a part owner of The Lodge, so from time to time you may run into him and some other NFLers there.
other This place looks cool inside and has a fun vibe.  First the downsides: menu can actually be a little overwhelming, you get the impression the staff is overworked/crazy busy (how long does it take to make tea?) to the point where if there are more than four people ahead of you in line, you want to shoot yourself.  Unless you have nowhere to be, ever.  Upsides: huge selection, fairly helpful staff (paralyzing indecision?  that's what they're there for), ambiance, coolness factor.  I need to try the food here.
other Kinda of a rough and tumble crowd at times with the OTB booth in the back corner of the bar. Place is usually crowded after work with the blue collar drinking types and unless your a regular you will probably get ignored like I did on a previous visit. In this case, finally tried the food and it was surprisingly good. The waitress said that the buffalo wrap was good, so I went with grilled chicken tossed in mild wing sauce and that went into my wrap with the usual cheese, lettuce, some blue cheese and maybe a touch of bacon? THe wrap was huge and the chicken and blue cheese melded perfectly together. On the side dish selection wheel, I went with sweet potato fries - this was a decent version of that variety, but the raspberry sauce? served as a dipping option was a fail. Great service on a saturday afternoon and reasonable prices ($8.99) for a filling lunch.
other They wouldn't honor pet co's online sale prices.  That's the first time I've heard about this.
other This place is delicious. Great food and when they cook in front of you they do a lot of cool tricks and stuff. I would eat there everyday if I could afford it.
other I went for both breakfast & dinner two days in a row. I got the commuter sandwich which was fabulous - didn't think such simple ingredients could blow my mind. I came back for dinner and got the kale & quiona salad - again - very simple, but amazing.I need to come back and get the pizza!
other I was in Arcadia today and saw this place so I had to try it out. The menu has some variation from the normal Thai restaurant as well as some classics. I decided to try the jalapeno curry. I was surprised it was not as spicy as I expected but the flavor was excellent. Service in this place could not have been better, everyone was very friendly and attentive. Lunch prices were very good for the quality of the food and was an excellent value in my opinion. I'll definitely be back to try some more new things.
other This place seems to get better every time I visit. The first time was a Friday night out with the guys. We met up for dinner and I had (and loved) the pulled pork and sweet potato fries. After dinne we got our drink on with a live band. The waitress was helpful in getting us drunk off a variety of liquors. And the shots kept on coming! It was a blast. The second time was more laid back, just grabbing a beer with a girlfriend. It was a Tuesday and the place was pretty busy. The next time me and the girlfriend showed up completely wasted and they had an Irish band playing. It was a perfect way to end our night after clubbing at the gay bar! We had a baileys nightcap and everything went dark from there. Awesome night!
other It's not that I don't like this place, it's just that it's very run of the mill. Bison Witches does the standard sports bar cum college drinking hole thing. That's all that can really be said about this place. You can't really hate this place for that because it is what it is. A milquetoast spot at its most average..
other ::Sigh::I love places like this.  It is adorable and unique and intimate and perfect.  The outdoor patio looks like a great hang out spot (but obviously it is too hot for any of that just yet) and the interior is small and intimate.  I was surprised when I walked in as it was much smaller than I thought it would be- but who knows where I got the idea that it would be a gigantic place.  Our server was hilarious and fun- he happened to be from Ohio and informed me he was a Buckeye (I'm from Michigan, but I'm not a Wolverine so Buckeyes usually don't hate me) and was pretty cool about taking my fun jabs at his home state.  He was super attentive and even was nice enough to give me directions home (horrific sense of direction). I kind of wanted to be best friends with him.  Anyway... I had the one organic glass of red wine on the menu (he brought me a sample first) and the Pasena.  Both were great beverage choices.  I also got to nibble on the tomato/mozzarella and flaked tuna bruschetta and was pleased with both.  I'd go with the original.I dream of the day that I find such a cute little place on the West side (feel free to suggest one if I'm missing it).  The atmosphere rocks, and the unique booze options only add to the charm of this place.
other I crave their jalapeno fried rice. AMAZING!
other Fred M. pretty much said what I would say, so I won't beat a dead horse.  I'll add, though, that they offer a wide variety of deep-fried quesadillas.  Did you catch that?DEEP FRIED QUESADILLAS!
other My brother from San Francisco was in town and missing the sushi from the bay area. I decided I'd let him choose where we'd go out even though I'd never ever heard of this place before. It was definitely in a not-so-glamorous area, tucked on the side of a dinky shopping center (sorry shopping center). When we walked in I was pleasantly surprised by the quaint atmosphere and set-up. It's definitely small but everyone working there and eating there seemed to be genuinely having a great time. We sat at the bar/long table in front of the sushi chefs which was a fun experience. We started off with sake, and it was pretty darn smooth. We ordered a variety of different dishes including sea urchin eggs, yellowtail shashimi and the king crab roll. They were even accomodating to make my brother dishes that weren't on the menu. The chefs are so nice and fun and the prices are pretty good!My brother was extremely impressed coming from a top sushi city. I look forward to coming back and trying more of their extensive menu, especially for happy hour.
other As far as the sandwiches go, the place is fine but just thought I'd mention that if you are trying the broccoli-cheddar soup late in the day you may find it "overcooked tasting" bordering on acrid and burnt like we did.I guess they assume everyone is going to order a $other footlong because pricing for six-inchers is not quickly established by looking at the overhead menu.
other Okay now this is a large chain and on average it's okay to good!  and I have been to this place many, many times, but I have to say the last time I went there for the happy hour hot wings (they were dry, over cooked) then I had ordered a steak and seafood combo (Cajun) something but after my second brew I thought it was me, so I had the wife and my son taste it man was it salty!!!!  It tasted like they dropped the salt shaker in the food, but my waitress assured me that could not have happened "because all there sauces come in bags and are pre-made" (Gross, that did it for me) I  was outta there with the quickness...
other This place had amazing food for reasonable prices. They have tiny card games at the tables which was pretty neat too, it keeps you busy while you wait for your food. The bar was neat, and the atmosphere was ok. I did not enjoy the music, and it was too loud to ignore. The service was pretty good, but the waitress made my friends and I uncomfortable, like we shouldn't have been there. It might have just been that one particular girl, and I would still go back. Don't dress too casual...
other Great fresh food and vegetarian options! I will definitely return!!
other Slow service, staff needs more training. There's like other managers and none of the know what they are doing, i don't think this place is going to make it. Sorry but you lost other very good patrons Saturday night because of your poor customer service
other I really like this place and would definitely come back.  I had a blueberry martini that was dreamy and for dinner I had the halibut entree which was also very good.  Their wine selection is very good... I did have a glass of wine too because someone ordered a bottle of wine and I felt compelled to help him out:)  And from what I remember the service was also very good.
3 Very nice happy hour. Its dark inside but the beer prices are good and they have free sliders, chips and salsa.
other WOW what can I say... our friends have eaten here for years and we finally got to eat at Don and Charlie's for the first time in all the years that we have been coming to Spring Training.  We had an excellent dinner i was in the mood for fish and had the Macademia crusted Halibut.... WONDERFUL!!!!! My hubby had the prime rib and finished off every last juicy bite... the scalloped potatoes were the BEST I have ever had at any restaurant.Must make this one of our usual stops during our yearly visit to Az.
other This place really hits the spot.  It's everything a hamburger place should be and nothing it shouldn't.  Their burgers are good-sized and delicious.  I attribute their scrumptiousness to the bread in the buns, but their meat is phenomenal as well; add some cheese and green chiles, and it's like a bunch of awesome ingredients decided to get together to take part in creating one of the best burgers in town with a little help from the grill.  The fries are effing good too.The pitchers of beer are cheap and cold, and if you want to feed your inner hipster they also have bottles of PBR and cans of Schlitz.  Not a lot to feast the eyes on - the place has a real old-school "bar" feel - but the food compensates for what it may lack in elegance.
other This place is awesome!  Where else can you hear incredible live jazz music for free on a Monday night with reasonably priced drinks?  Any other major city (like, say, New York), the cover would be at least $15, and they would make you pay for the second set, as well, and a place to sit or stand with a decent view of the musicians would be hard to come by, and by the end of the night you would end up feeling ripped off.  Granted, this place can get crowded on the weekends, but no wonder.  The beer (no draft) and wine selection is good, the vibe is laid-back, and the music I've heard has been great (I've only see one group here--Jiggle--and they play jazz.)Tip for music-lovers:  Sit or stand in the room where the music is.  Sitting any farther back and you may be tempted to take a swing at the people who just come to chat and fail to understand what makes the Lost Leaf so unique.  But do give them a bit of a break.  They are, after all, probably "paying" for your cover charge with all their imbibing of alcohol.
other Loves the recent Cezanne show. In fact I've seen it twice in the last week. I need to find out more about who curated the exhibit as it is very fine. The Oriental collection is very nice and soothing. The Downtown Chamber Group gave a wonderful concert in the great hall on Sunday. I wonderful and unusual program of saxophone and harp. I think it is great to have music in the galleries. I liked the musicians being on a platform. since the room isn't banked one can see the performers.A few things I'm not so crazy about:The great room is this awesome space for large art. Sunday I sat and looked at it for several hours. You know, not such great art. I find the Terrill boring and the other pieces uninteresting.The cafe never quite lives up to its promise. My lunch companion barley touched her lunch and the waiter never asked why or offered a box.Enough grousing I love the place and go often.
other Good coffee and they always take care of what i need in a timely manner. Never mind the fact it is literally 20 yards from my front door, but that may play into my liking of the establishment.  Either way you should check it out and enjoy some free Wifi.
3 If you don't want to read the whole review, I'll sum it up in one sentence -- Via Delosantos only uses yellow cheese.I went here about other years ago for a celebratory occasion, and was afraid to eat the food based on the smell of old grease and the look of the entrees on tables around. We ate on the patio, which is directly on Central Avenue, and after the horrid smell of grease & exhaust pipes, I couldn't wait to flee the scene.Last year, I was unknowingly led back to this same place.  Years had passed, and I had completely forgotten about my vow to never return. This time, I was pleased.It probably helps that upon entering my expectations were very low. I immediately was attracted to the kitschy Mexican artwork, their vast tequila collection on display, and of course, the christmas lights.The salsa seemed fresh and was just the right amount of spice. They keep the chips & salsa flowing so be careful not to fill up.  The margaritas are really sweet, but they're cheap and will get the job done.This is the kind of place where you stick to basics. Don't get fancy or try and order something healthy.  Get a chimichanga, burrito,  shrimp enchiladas, or a chile relleno, and if it's appropriate, get that sucker enchilada style. Be sure to have your Tums handy when done if you think you can eat a whole plate by yourself.The portions are huge and totally splitable.  Oh, last word of advice, don't get the guacamole. It's super gringo, and has a ton of sour cream in it.I'm giving this place 3 stars b/c it's a good value if you're sharing, they ambiance is very comfortable & amusing, and the service is very accommodating.
3 Really good prices but I would stray from the wings. It is very greasy so beware!
other Just isn't very good.I don't understand why people give this place even three stars.  It's rare for me to give a place a low rating, but, My Big Fat Greek restaurant is nothing but gimmick anymore and has gone from bad to worse.   The food is not even close to any representation of what good Greek food tastes like.I've been to this place several times over the years.  This location and others.   It used to be just on the lower end of OK...  it's never been as good as you can get from a 'Ma and 'Pa place.  However, we went for lunch the other day and it's just gotten to the point I wouldn't even go back for a quick bite.We ordered the garlic hummus, and it was overly full of garlic and not home made.  It seemed to be loaded with garlic powder, as opposed to fresh hummus that just had roasted garlic in it.   The olives we ordered were rough at best.  UGH even thinking about them.  Overly seasoned and not very fresh.   The rice was over cooked and was so soft it lacked any sort of texture.The first rule of good let, alone great food, is FRESH.   This place needs a rescue.Less critical, but, I think an overall representation of what has happened to the place, the menu's were totally trashed.   As in ratty, tattered, and dirty.  The lamination was coming off them and they were dirty. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.
other Walgreen's has the best nuts. However, they recently changed their prices and only give a cheaper, 2-for on the halves and pieces. And they upped the price (again) on the whole cashews.  I will be shopping elsewhere.
other Omg! So good! So fresh! Great burger joint. Ordered the tri-tip steak sandwich with grilled onions. The steak was tender and perfectly pink. Husband ordered the Original with fries. The burger was juicy and a good size. The fries were perfectly seasoned and fresh. We split a drink. Total bill was a bit over $14. Not a bad dinner price. Place was empty when we got here at 9:00 on a Saturday night but quickly filled up. Great service and great food. We will make The Habit a habit!
other Thai??? Really?? I love Thai food and couldn't be happier to try a new restaurant. Wow! It was a slap in the face on so many levels. The other hostesses were the rudest I have had the displeasure of having to interact with. We ordered take out and as we waited for out food from the kitchen the hostesses made us uncomfortable... As if we were imposing on there entry.The food was not spectacular. We ordered pad Thai , was very dry but not horrible. The sweet or sour beef was watery and seemed more like fajita with way too many peppers. No  sticky rice, green papaya salad, Larb...
other very laid back, very clean. This was my first piercing since I was a little kid. I had my tongue piercing it was very professional and they answered all of my questions. I went to this place specifically because of the good ratings they had online. My friend also had a tragus piercing here that went seamlessly also. I felt very safe and comfortable.
other YUM! The flavors were great! Oatmeal cookie and caramel apple were great and tasted just like the real thing. The only reason I gave other instead of other is because some of the toppings such as the twinkies and baklava were whole pieces and I wish I could have just grabbed pieces of them instead of a whole one...toppings like those could add a lot of $$ very quickly so I skipped those ones.
other Great food and atmosphere. Had lunch there on a Friday afternoon. Parking is a bit of a challenge. Had the pork pita which had onions, bell peppers, and pepper jack cheese...awesome...The burgers are good too! The service was excellent.
other ...the customer service alone gets other stars, but when you factor in the semi-annual sales it is more like 6.  Having been to a number of Nordstrom's in multiple cities I'd put this particular location on the same level as those in San Francisco (without the assinine traffic to contend with) and Seattle and only a notch below the best of the best in Chicago.  Living in a city with a Nordstrom and a Nordstrom Rack is going to be a daily exercise in resisting temptation.
other I LOVE Chic Nails!I used to go to Tip & Toes on 48th street and Ray Road, until one day they were "too busy" to take my friend and I in for pedicured. We discovered Chic Nails and have been doing all of our manicures and pedicures there since. The staff is extremely friendly and they give the best pedicures for a very reasonable price. I highly recommend this nail salon over any other!P.S. It is extremely close to CK's Bar & Grill to go for happy hour after! :)
other Thanks to all of you Yelpers for recommending this place! It was just what I have been looking for in my neighborhood- fresh and tasty Chinese food for a decent price unspoiled by trendiness. Thanks! I will definitely add Deserg Jade to my regular rotation.
other Old Chicago is about what you'd expect  from a chain serving by that name - a pretty basic menu, with a Chicago slant.  The food rates a solid 3 stars - not outstanding, but certainly not bad, and good enough for me to go back.  I threw in a 4th star because we've had consistently great service there.  We've had one waitress twice who is genuinely nice, clearly doesn't hate her job, and is on top of her game service-wise.  That stuff goes a LONG ways with Brak.  For a casual meal and perhaps a couple of belts, I rank Old Chicago comfortably ahead of such yawners as TGI Fridays (which has declined a TON in recent years IMHO) and others like Chilis and (gasp) Applebee's.  Give it a try, I think you'll like it.
other Great flavors even though there aren't many to choose from! Fresh fruit is such an awesome feature as most places are def not and limited to the healthy choices of topping! I visit as often as I can!!
other Accidently discovered this place because of the Chinese New Year/Vietnamese Tet Festival of this year.. very nice surprise that the buns here are bigger and have more filling than the buns at Lee Lee's Market. I know, I know, there are probably many more places in AZ that sells these, but I honestly don't know of any other places that sell these other than Mekong Plaza (here) and Lee Lee's in Chandler. It's around $1.30-1.40 a bun and they seem very fresh because the times that I've came by, someone is preparing and cooking them in large ovens in the back. Very nice that it is located by the Asian market and shops. They have a frequent buyer card you can pick up in the front (for every $100 you spend, you get $10 off your next bakery purchase). This is gonna be in use for me since I can see myself coming back countless times!!P.S. Please change your outdoor business sign to "AA Wholesome Bakery". Since it says "Mekong Bakery" on the outside, it confuses people.
other The family and I love this place, as does anyone I've taken there. First time I went I had a cheeseburger pizza - huge and delicious. Their beer is great too - brewed right on the spot. My wife loved the fish tacos -- it says a lot about a place that every time you go, everything you try, is fantastic. You'll pay a little bit, but it's worth it.
3 A coyote ugly knock off but a cool place. The ladies were friendly and there was one who could dance her ass off. Dayum!! Seriously though, I was the token black chic  and had a good time. Except for the one lady that seem to attach herself to me. Weird to say the least. Overall a cool place.Be warned, do not attempt to take any pictures in this place. They will hunt you down and stop you. Especially if the ladies are "performing" on the bar. A big no-no!!!
other I've been to Milano's Music several times and each experience is worse than the first time.  I look at the reviews of people I actually know and realize that each experience is different.  On the biggest day of the year for Small Business owners who should be reaching out to the customers and gladly sell them the smallest items Milano misses that point, by miles.  My husband is re-learning to play the drums and needed a drummer's throne and since it was November 24th and "Small Business Saturday" I thought "why not give them another try", guess what we walked out with Nothing they lost potential set of drum customer  ( those can cost anywhere from a few $100 to $1k ).  I won't go back in there.  The guy that is in charge of the drum section is rude and pompous and walked away from us TWICE.  The second time was enough to make my blood boil.  We found a throne in another section that my husband liked and I said let's get it.  The guy came over and said "Oh, I have another one in the box" and grabbed the one in my husband hands and walked off never to be seen again.  We waited and waited at the checkout counter for him to show up, he never did because he had decided to help another couple.  I looked at the cashier and my husband and said "NOT cool at all" and my husband set all the other items he was going to purchase down and said we won't be purchasing anything.  I felt bad for the guy at the register because it wasn't his fault and he apologized but that doesn't give the guy running a section the right to decide what customer is more important and that is what he did.  New customers should never be treated any differently and to basically make a statement of you are not important enough was the final straw.  I grew up around Milano's music stores they were the first  to give me guitar lessons and it is sad to see this happy.  Besides this Yelp review , I plan to write their the store personally.  When small businesses are struggling and this kind of thing happens  a person begins to understand why more people shop with a big box store and less and less from Mom and pop stores.
3 Food was tasty. I ordered the veggie combo, and was a little disappointed that it didn't come with more of a variety of things, especially for $12. BUT what it did come with was good.
other According to the reviews I have read for this spot, I must have ordered from them on an off day. Today for delivery, I ordered a cup of soup (something tomato based with potatoes and beef in it), 1/other Vermonter sandwich, lemonade and a cookie. The soup was ok (bland, but ok), the sandwich was...well, kind of sad looking. A big dark green piece of wilted lettuce, barely any of the 'cranberry mayo' or whatever was supposed to be the mayo on there, the turkey and ham tasted great...there just wasn't very much of it, and they completely forgot my request for a side of mayo, mustard and a knife/fork on a triangle cut piece of wheat bread. I wasn't able to choose my chips, so ended up with some plain ones and my cookie was undercooked by about 10 minutes. The outer circle was baked, but the rest was cookie moosh. (Which is fine when you are in a cookie dough mood, but alas...I was not.) The lemonade was FANTASTIC though. I don't believe I'll be trying this one again unless I'm in a pinch, but I'm happy I tried them today instead of just jumping into a catering order with them. This may be the only time I have been mislead by previous Yelps. *sigh*
other I have been to this Mojo fro yo location several times now and really enjoy their yogurts! The yogurt tastes great, is light and refreshing and somewhat healthy if you avoid all of the chocolately/candy toppings yet they offer tons of fruit options. Priced by weight, a great stop after retail therapy at Saks or dessert after Stingray Sushi or True Food at the Biltmore. A must try, plus they have punch cards for free fro yo after a couple of visits! :)
3 Everything was nice. The ice cream was delicious, no overwhelming alcohol taste & an interesting variety of flavors. Service was fine, place was clean. I'll go back, but only because I have a killer sweet tooth and they're in the neighborhood.
other tried this place due to a restaurant.com gift certificate, other stars for service, we had an awesome and attentive server which made it great for first visit. drinks were good. went with friends and did some sharing to try the different dishes we ordered. the salmon quesadillas was on the fishy side, the pollo relleno good but a little dry and didnt get the poblano and goat cheese flavors that drew me to choosing the dish, the cilantro mousse sounded more interesting on the menu but was cream cheese and cilantro, the Obama burrito was the winner on our table though. great salsa. would come back and try other dishes and tae in some live music.
other Phoenix Muni is a great stadium to see Oakland A's Spring Training Games. Yes, it's older than many of the other Arizona stadiums, but it has a simple charm that serves it wall. Great seats can be found just about anywhere in the park, and for $2other we were in row 7, just to the right of home plate. It's also pretty easy getting in and out of both the stadium and the parking lot.The only (minor) negative is probably common to most stadiums: there don't seem to be enough vendors (at least beer vendors; several people around us mentioned it), and the concession stands can get somewhat backed up at times. But for a relaxing place to watch baseball in the Arizona sun, it's hard to beat Phoenix Municipal Stadium.
3 Breadfruit is a cool spot. The interior of the place is well decorated and they can only seat about 15-20 people, making a nice, intimate ambiance. I really appreciate that they serve locally grown organic produce and that their chicken is all natural and raised cage free. Any addition of a Jamaican restaurant down town earns at least three stars in my book. We arrived at 7:30pm and were the only people there throughout almost the entire meal..We brought our own bottle of wine and there was only a $other corking fee, not to shabby.We started with the plantain and avacado spring rolls, I really liked that wonton was baked and not deep fried, the presentation was nice, the mango chutney was fresh but the rolls themselves lacked flavor. I really wished they would have paired some other fruit or spice to add more contrast to the dish. For my main I got the jerk chicken and I was a little disappointed. Again they did an excellent job with the presentation, but the corn was mushy and what the jerk rub lacked in flavor they tried to make up for in spice.  I like spicy, and can handle a lot of heat, but heat shouldn't overpower flavor...The chef/owner came out and asked us how we enjoyed our meal, and explained his philosophy behind the food. The service was excellent, but in comparison to some other Jamaican places I've been, it really only warrants 3 stars (sorry)!
other We stayed at the Sheraton downtown and Matt's was a short walk.  Definitely worth the walk, and it helped to justify eating such a large breakfast.  There is probably something there that is not very good, but we did not find it.  When you get there, make sure you check in with the person running the register
other Rarely do I give a other star rating but after four attempts in four months to get my fax line and internet rolling I can honestly say they have earned this.  After finally showing up for a scheduled appointment the tech told us our internet was fine but we disagree because we are getting the same speed we had with Qwest in Cave Creek (SLOW)  and they are charging us $6other a month for what they call the upgraded 20mbs.  Furthermore, I tried to send out a couple faxes after he left and the line is not responding.  Im going to drive down to the store tomorrow and demand that they remove the fees for service I have not received and just get efax.  As I noted in the first review we were excited to upgrade to faster internet so that makes this experience even worse.
other So much better that other Dorks, I mean guys.  They have salads and great chicken selections!
other I LOVE this bar. My first visit was in 200other when it was known as Bar Nun. I'd just moved to AZ and I was drawn in by the neon green light and funny name. Little did I know it was the beginning of a love affair. Since I didn't know anyone yet I went by myself and sat at the bar. The staff was friendly and so were the patrons. Some of the patrons turned out to be a little too friendly, and the bartender, Jennifer, insisted that the barback walk me to my car to ensure my safety. As if that wasn't enough to make a fan out of me, I found out they serve $other Blue Moons all day Saturday and the food is awesome!The burgers are great, and you can order them rare if you like. I also became addicted to their BBQ chicken sandwich. And the wings. They'll grill them instead of fry them for you which is a bonus. In fact I don't thing there is anything that I have tried and disliked here.Thursday-Sunday night they usually have a pretty decent cover band. Usually classic rock or 80s stuff. They also have NTN and a ton of TVs if you're into sports.I was so in love that when it came time to move from my apartment, I made sure my new house was within walking distance. Not that you'd need to walk, (since half the year it is hot as hell even at 2am I can see why you wouldn't want to walk) they offer a free ride program on the weekends where they'll pick you up and drop you off. That way you don't have to worry about Sheriff Joe and wearing pink undies at Tent City.Wow, I kinda wanna move back now. CK's I miss you!!!
3 Haven't been to a Chili's in FOREVER but those darn gift cards get me every time. Stopped by today for dinner and we ordered the other for 20 special (an app and other entrees). The food was alright-we ordered the Spicy Chicken Fajitas, the Bacon Chicken Quesadilla and started off with the Onion and Jalapeno Stack. The jalapenos were lame but everything else tasted great after a long day at work.What was not so great was the service. Two waiters introduced themselves (I figured one was training) but neither bothered to stop by and fill up our drinks or really check in. The girl who served us seemed to spend most of her time on the other side of the dining room and the teen host actually ended up being the one to refill my Strawberry Lemonade. So thanks to the young dude manning the desk and NOT my slow waiterS.
other I'm being on the generous side in giving MEBAD (as I've seen others refer to this place) other stars...It's kind of a unique gem that you don't see anymore with the owner at the register and a slamming lunch business in addition to the grocery items for sale that are rare foods, snacks, and ingredients from the Middle East.  I suggested this place for lunch with Amy D today after reading about it on Yelp awhile back... so happy I finally made it there myself!As Amy said in her review, we shared the baba ganoush and hummus plate and we each ordered a Greek Salad.  The salad was decent but nothing special, but the baba and hummus with the whole wheat pita was so damn tasty that we didn't even leave a bite.The free cup of homemade daily lemonade was a perk and the owner was really sweet... and I really did like the flavor of it.  I happen to love lemonade!I'll for sure return to MEBAD when I'm in the area to try more from their menu... this is the kind of place you want people to know about since you can tell how much work the owner and staff put into it each day.  If you haven't been, stop by... maybe I'll see you there - but please don't ask me to share my baba ganoush and hummus with you - I'm ordering my own next time!
other I would give them a other if the service was better.  The food is always great.  I've tried 6 or 7 different versions of the calzone and the stromboli is awesome.  My boys love the pizza.  The price is great for the portion.  Great family spot and the delivery is on time.
other I'm completely impressed by The Mission and I can't wait to go back and try more of their amazing food.  My husband and I chose The Mission for our 8th Anniversary dinner and had a wonderful time - the staff is extraordinarily knowledgeable and very warm & welcoming.  Yelp steered us in the right direction as per usual, so we split the cheese plate with manchego to start, the pork shoulder tacos for dinner and split a pumpkin bread pudding for dessert.  Everything was expertly prepared and delicious.  The bread pudding was EASILY the best I've ever had.  We usually don't order desserts and I'm glad we did, because I can't stop thinking about how amazing this was.  My husband had an Avocado Margarita and an Estrella beer (Awesome that they have this available - and it was even served in an Estrella glass - impressive).  Since I'm pregnant, I asked if the bartender could make me a virgin version of their "Sophia Loren" with fresh strawberries & mint - score!  It was delicious and I'll certainly be back to try it with the proper amount of booze :)  Lastly, how amazing is that Himalayan Salt Brick wall????  I NEED this in my house!
other Jewish girls in Chinese dresses serving Japanese food. If that isn't a recipe for confusion, I don't know what is.Too bad, really. Because when they first opened up, they had a real Japanese chef who had a respectable career and was trying to make actual Japanese cuisine. He naturally didn't last long in this 1980s pseudo-asian theme park environment. Remember when the owner used to intermittently drop the screens down and fire up the THX system and play movie trailers from last year? The chefs couldn't even see their hands. Now that's setting your priorities!Happy hour and late night patio is this place's saving grace (for others, not for me). But it's so far from Japanese food/sushi as to make them guilty of false advertising. See my Stingray review for a similar take on the food experience. If you FAIL rice, you FAIL sushi.
other This place is literally within walking distance from my apartment, yet I have passed by it daily. This morning I was hungry for breakfast and had a lot of things to do so I thought I would try something close. I have noticed the parking lot is usually full, so I thought it must be good. I had no idea what type of food they had or what to expect.It was Sunday morning just around 9:30 and I was fortunate to be able to walk in and instantly have a table. The server was very friendly and she checked back often always refilling my coffee. The menu is a little newspaper and it's a bit overwhelming with many options, but I finally settled on the volcano. It is described as three pancakes, other sausage links, other bacon strips, and an egg. The pancakes are three different sizes and stacked to create a volcano with the egg on top. It was under $9 and I was surprised at the size of it! I attempted but could not finish it. The big pancake was left uneaten. They do have a smaller option for around $6 and that might be the better way to go unless you have just returned from a month long trip through the jungle or plan to share with someone. The server continued to check on me and even offered up a to go cup of coffee. I don't know how I have overlooked this place but based on the experience today, I would put it right at the top of best spots in town for breakfast. I will say come early because by the time I was leaving the lobby was full, people were milling around the parking lot, and the wait to be seated was 1other minutes.
other My girlfriend and I were hungry and wanted to try something new, so we hopped on the netbook and fired up Yelp. We tried Crazy Jim's, and boy was this a good pick. When we 1st rolled up to CJ's my girl was like "I don't know about this!!!" I said "lets just go in and take a look, if it is clean inside then lets try it". Once inside the place was small but quaint and most important it was CLEAN. So I ordered a veggie pita and got the pasta salad as a side. The food was ready pretty fast and I had envisioned something like a sandwich that you pickup and eat but it was all laid out over my plate. The pita was very good and I give a big thumbs up to, the pasta salad was kinda plain. My girl has a greek salad and she liked it but wasn't too crazy about the dressing. I would definitely go back to Crazy Jim's and eat. As a matter of fact anytime I am craving that veggie pita, your boy "E" will come to visit. ps. Our server was great also, friendly, fast and helpful.
other Hire a busboy! I had to say it. I had to take these pictures. This is my _third_ visit since my May update with the same result and I can't keep it to myself any longer. The staff neglects the dining room. Period. Dot. Patrons often have to move dirty plates, stacking them up on top of trays at another table, just to sit down.My recommendation to the owners is to put up some garbage bins like all other self-busing fast-food places and make _us_ do it if you're not going to.I have to wonder what happens to all those half-filled salsa squirt bottles left on the tables unrefrigerated for so long. Do they top off and return them to service, or are they emptied and washed before refilling?It is my sincere hope that very soon I will be able to update this review again and say that things are back to normal. Until then, I have to advise driving a bit further south to Mi Patio, or north to Sylvia's La Canasta.
other I love the kitsch of this place! Bears bears everywhere! Black Bear Diners are usually found in small to medium sized towns, but for some reason this one is smack in the middle of urban sprawl. So not complaining though, because it means I don't have to drive to the middle of nowhere to enjoy their old-timey newspaper-menu and awesome pot roast! Their fare is strictly comfort food and always well-prepared. The full portions will fill an average 200lb guy, so it's nice that smaller folk like myself have the option of getting the small (or "senior) portion! Save room for their personal-sized pies...you won't regret it!
other The fry bread in itself was great, it is just what goes inside it is not that great. I have been wanting to come here for a long time since I have heard so much about it. I got a bean and cheese fry bread and the beans came half smashed with whole pinto beans in it, which I can't stand. The beans are not very flavorful when they are whole. The cheese was a thick shred which didn't melt and it was altogether disappointing. My partner got the fry bread with ground beef which he said was not flavorful at all. It was like they just cooked the beef with no flavoring at all. Maybe they were having a really off night? Yelp, why have you been betraying me lately? I keep going to these great reviewed places and they suck.
other Going to Desert Botanical Garden is the perfect field trip for a beautiful day like today... I've been to DBG a handful of times for events, exhibit openings, meetings, and of course Yelp In Bloom (a yelper party that I planned a couple of years ago)... but today I went with my son and we met some other friends with the sole purpose of checking out the butterfly exhibit.We didn't get lucky enough to have a butterfly land on us, but we did see tons of gorgeous butterflies.  There were orange butterflies and yellow butterflies and striped butterflies, etc... The flowers in the pavillion are pretty to look at as well.  We visited the gift kiosk afterward and took home a butterfly finger puppet, which I know we will get tons of use from (only $6.25). The exhibit runs until May 13th, so don't miss it!And if you do find yourself with more time while you're there, definitely check out the design for a living world exhibit as well... I saw that when it first opened and it was really cool.  The photography alone is worth a visit.I just wish I had more time to explore DBG more often!
other It is romantic here even if you are with just friends. The waitress kneels at the couch to speak with you, pour your wine, bring your check...I love that...its so other star and respectful. Our waitress was so friendly and I was on cloud 9 because the whole ambience made my evening so nice. I love the darkness of it, its all so exotic and relaxing there especially with all the coves and different areas to be seated. Apparently you have to put your name down if you want a table for certain as it seems to be packed anytime I have been there. We needed one more bar stool-we had no reservation and the waiter actually went "out to the storage" to get us one. Impressive!
3 Pomeroy's and I have a really ass backwards relationship. Typically, the purpose a bar serves me is to quench a thirst brought on by numerous factors, the most typical one being the uncanny excitement I have for making poor (but fun) decisions. Because of this, the purpose I serve bars is not only the obviously fiscal nature of the relationship, but I often serve as the harbinger of good times.So here's the problem with P-roy's.I never want to come here. Ever. This is the place I END UP at and it's typically the result of somebody else's negative circumstance that I don't really want to deal with (friend meltdown, death, crashed vehicles), and I almost always have to leave a place I like to come here. I know, weird, right? But I've been here more times than I can shake a stick at, and while I am usually the omen of good times to come, I always know that if I am on my way to Pomeroy's, not only will I be saving copious amounts of cashola, I also always end up having a blast and not doing something stupid. So the role reversal always sends me for a loop, and the bathroom always smells like fresh poop, but I can't help kinda liking it.
other The grooming salon at this location does an amazing job with pets. Yesterday was the 2nd time my baby was groomed here by Chip.  I hope I spelled his name correctly, he's just wonderful.  He's very patient and very kind with my Sushi-poo and I'm comfortable leaving him in Chip's hands.
other Possibly the best burger I've ever had--definitely the best I've had in Phoenix.I get the classic, which comes on brioche with a choice of cheese. It's the only thing I've ever ordered there, because it's so damn good I can't pass it up. AND they get their beef from humanely raised, grass-fed cows. And beer selection, and the fries with aioli... Well, others here have told you how good they are.Pro tip? Throw a little of that aioli on your burger, too. Oh, and come hungry--it's a generously sized burger.It's a little pricey, but Delux is a really delicious treat.
other This place used to be quite good but I think they may have had an ownership change recently.  Over the past 1other months or so we have seen the quality of the food and service level both drop to unacceptable levels.The food is overall average - the fajitas down right poor and the drinks very inconsistent.  They do get somewhat busy with a bar crowd but that too seems inconsistent so when they do get busy the service gets very bad.When service deteriorates the Manager (or owner, I'm not sure) seems to hide from customers. Overall, make the trip down to Shea Blvd and find much better at better prices.
other I really wanted to enjoy my experience at Indulge, but didn't. From the website, local magazine reviews, and driving by, I expected it to be a slightly upscale neighborhood joint, but it really is no different than a Fuddruckers.We were underwhelmed by the food and hated the environment. Two of us built our own burgers, and one ordered a pre-made pick off the menu. We had the dill chips (fried pickles) as an appetizer. I can't say that any of us loved our meal, and as soon as we walked out we all agreed we weren't interested in going back. It was just no better than you could make at home (and I burn soup).  The tables were crowded, too close together, and the place was uncomfortably noisy. Our servers were trying to clear plates as soon as one of us set down a fork (no one was waiting for our table), and asked for our dessert orders while we were still eating. The whole experience was rushed, loud, uncomfortable, and not "indulging" in any way. I'm so disappointed.
other HARISSA SPICED FRIES. Need I say more? The wine list is exceptional, and they are open late, both of which are mandatory if you're a boozy creature of the night like me.Our server was quite attentive without being intrusive. Our wine glasses were never dry, and she instinctively sensed that it would be a three bottle sort of night and suggested additional bottles to go with our meal.The food was of a generous proportion, so bear this in mind when ordering. My Fez Salad was fresh, crisp, and the combination of the dressing and goat cheese hit the spot. Our hummus platter was heaven-sent, and had just the right amount of garlic. The lamb kisra was also exceptional, and immediately devoured. The aforementioned Harissa fries were fiery and I often dream of them. No, really. If Fez was located in Tucson, I would gain at least ten pounds from just eating harissa fries every day. Harissa, for those of you who are unfamiliar, is a North African chili-based spice that has a lovely smoky quality. I highly recommend it!Well, Fez. I'm in Phoenix next weekend. Prepare yourself for round two.
other Great beer, really good food and no wait.Ok yes it was noon on a Sat but that can be hard to findany day of the week, at any time.
other only been here twice but the food kicked ass both times!  biscuits and gravy is the way to go here.  prices are right as well.  definately recommend this joint. seems to be about a 10 minute wait to get seated.  not bad.
other YIKES!! Its a good thing that this place it a far drive for me - cuz it could spell trouble. If you ever have a craving for a real delight and want to really 'enjoy a silent moment'.....try one of their coconut, lemon or dark chocolate cupcakes. Honestly I didnt care how many calories are in them....I was weak in the knees. There is standing room only in this shop  - literally I think my bathroom is bigger -but a big thumbs up for the cupcakes, and kudos on their packaging!!. (its definitely built into the pricing!)
other I went today to meet my daughter for lunch.  We are both big sushi enthusiasts.  The interior and atmosphere was beautiful.  Well appointed.The service was excellent.  We ordered edamame, was good...nothing to rave about.  Not much you can do to mess that up.  Drinks were well poured but exspensive for what you got.  Ordered five different sushi rolls.All five were bland, not much flavor and stale.  The fish was not fresh.Paid $1other for a soft shell crap roll and it tasted days old.  Will not go back.Did here they have good pizza and a happy hour at three.  My daughter says to give it another try.  We'll see... I'll let you know if I do.
other I could remember Tokyo Expresses were everywhere in the valley.  I loved their food.  I was surprise to see them around and excited to eat the food again.  We entered the place and it smelled like bleach.  STRONG.  It is ok.  We move to the menu and ordering area.  Everyone picked out their meal.  Ordered and sat down.  We got our food pretty quickly.  I got the Katsu Chicken meal (side sui may and drink).  The sauce in the Katsu was kinda of bland.  I remember the sauce was savory.  The sui may, I am sure was the pre-made frozen kind.  I was hungry so I ate it.
other LollyPOP vintage is pretty sweet! They always have something I like and the service is impeccable. I dont think its too over priced, I mean this Phx not SF or NYC!! of course u will over pay a bit. duh. U should def check it out ;)
other Awesome Mexican food, fast service at drive in or sit in and eat...try the new fish tacos, they're great, and authentic, too.
other If its cold, creamy ,sweet, and I can put many a topping of choice on it and its fat free and low calories, I'm all in. Golden spoon is this and more. Simply delicious flavors and all around good. Need I say more?
other So I was like a lemming trying this after Man vs Food when recently visiting Phoenix.  But......  the kid is right.... everything on the Del Rey torta works together.  And it is HUGE.  And it's great too.  Wonderfully constructed, just enough of everything and not too much of anything.  I also had the watermelon juice (interesting, huh)?  One strange thing.... first Mexican restaurant I've ever been in that didn't have chips and salsa.  Only real downside is that the service is a bit slow.  But they're slammed and deservedly so.
other RnR strikes me as a casual, urban place to meet up for drinks and a bite to eat. It's not what comes to mind when I think old town Scottsdale, but places like this popping up are helping to change my mind about the area. Unfortunately after I was finished I was reminded that it's still old town when I walked by a pan flute band on Main St.The old town parking corral is directly behind RnR, you can get to it from the alley next to RnR or off of 2nd Street.The space has a refreshing, industrial feel. I was impressed by the thought put into the seating options. Inside mostly features traditional high top tables for four, but I noticed they had a table near the bar that could seat at least 12. The downstairs patio features another bar, and both table and lounge chair seating. The upstairs patio has the best date seating, lots of tables for two.There was a lot of staff working during my visit. The host was friendly, and my waiter was attentive. My water was never empty and I got my sandwich in under 10 minutes. If anything they were a little too eager to please. I was both impressed and bemused when my waiter refilled my water glass, apparently noticed my ice had mostly melted, then returned with a scoop of ice to add to my cup.I just got a grilled cheese (which includes tomato and bacon) on my visit, I had dinner plans later but I was interested in feeling this place out. I really enjoyed it. The bread is cut pretty thick, which made me a little nervous. But it had a wonderful texture, and after a few bites I decided it worked for me and didn't overpower the delicious sharp cheddar and bacon like I expected.I look forward to returning to try other meals, and to sample what the bar has to offer. I understand RnR will have both late night hours and breakfast service. This is a great place to visit any time of day, but I'm excited about having a new, good place I can frequent after (or during) a night out.
3 Let's start with an SAT-type question:Scottsdale Stadium :: AT&T Park is like _______ :: Oakland Coliseum.a) Oakland A'sb) Rickey Hendersonc) Phoenix Municipal Stadiumd) Yankee StadiumIf you answered C, you, my friend are correct.  And you're pretty smart, too.  Give yourself a pat on the back.Much like Oakland Coliseum, Phoenix Muni won't amaze you with state-of-the-art facilities, breathtaking views or spectacular nightlife nearby.  What you get here is a functional, simple, 40-year-old ballpark that serves its purpose.  The crowds here are much smaller than you would encounter at other parks, but it fits 6000-7000 people comfortably.  Unless you are in the premium infield seats, you will be sitting on the aluminum benches or on the grassy knoll.  Pick your poison, so to speak.We always get the infield seats, because you can sit 1other rows behind home plate for under $20.  I don't care how bad the economy is, it's a steal!  Even if you sit directly behind home plate, you will most likely struggle to see the tiny outdated scoreboard screen in the centerfield.  There are no fancy food choices at Phoenix Muni.  If you're not intimidated by enormous wieners, a footlong hot dog might be for you.  Believe me when I say, you will not be able to eat more than two, no matter how much you love hot dogs.  I am also a fan of the little dining area by the left field foul pole.  You can sit there at a table with a giant umbrella, hide from the sun and sip your beverage of choice.  If you're lucky, you can even watch the game from some of those seats.The people who work here, from ushers to concession stand clerks, are incredibly nice.  They really do want to make sure you have a great time at the game, and it shows.Parking here is very easy.  For $5, you can park in the lot right across the street.  The lot rarely gets full, and you can always almost find a spot.  I hear there are ways to find free parking if you are willing to walk a little more, but at $5, why would you?  It's important to know, though, that the walk from the lot "across the street" from the ballpark will take you about 7 minutes.  There is no crosswalk on the street, and you have to use that ridiculous pedestrian bridge they erected with the sole purpose of annoying most baseball fans.So, +other star for great seats, +other star for cheap parking, -other star for horrible scoreboard, -other star for the pedestrian bridge.  A-OK, 3 stars.
other I would absolutely not recommend living here. I lived at these apartments for a year, and wow was the management staff a MESS. When I moved in, my mailbox was broken so I couldn't get mail for a week. They didn't give me a pool key, they gave me the wrong apartment keys, they would mix up all my information, and they just weren't very nice. I can't remember how many times they lost my work orders so I'd have to call and call to make sure things got fixed in my apartment! The neighbors were loud--I had to call the police maybe four times because they wouldn't turn down their music and I had to study for school and finals, and random people came banging on the door looking for some girl who had obviously p'd them off. The police came to my house in the middle of the night looking for her, too. One time, they gave my garage to somebody else even though I was still paying for it and when my husband came home in the evening with his pick-up full of expensive equipment, we had to wait for the cops to come and figure out whose car it was who was parked in our garage! it was a total nightmare. Shortly before I moved out new staff came in and they seemed somewhat better organized. But---I wouldn't take the chance. For the same price, you can definitely find somewhere better to live.
other We went there right before my Grandma's 100th birthday.  There were about 20 of us.  The place was busy but we called ahead and they put our name in even though we still didn't have a final count of people.  The place was busy but I know why.  EVERYONE had a different dish and we all loved it.  Everyone wanted to taste each others food because we all liked it so much.  We all seem to think we are food critics and we loved this place.  Extensive menu and they seemed to nail everything we had!  The staff was amazing and would go back in a heartbeat!
other Chick has the potential to be a restaurant we want to keep coming back to.  The food will keep us trying for an exceptional experience, but some things needs to be fixed if Chick is to see it's first anniversary.1.)  The space:  Cute slightly upper scale boutique "farmhouse".  Decor and lighting is warm yet modern.  The only miss: The beautiful tables.  They are heavily distressed with very deep grooves as if made from reclaimed wood.  There can't possibly be any way for them to clean the tables thoroughly - The thought of a small portion of everyone's food that has dined here before me staring at me -- especially as time goes on and those grooves fill up with food & germs grosses me out.  A piece of glass on each table is a definite food safety must.  To make matters worse, tables are set with your silverware on the bare table.  Silverware should never be placed on anything other than a fresh a napkin or table cloth.  2.)  The menu:  The menu they offer is a little different from your average restaurant which can make for a memorable experience.  However, putting a menu like theirs in a small but thick leather bound binder with just a couple items per page made us feel like unwelcome outsiders.  The incessant flipping between pages with types of entrees and sides and sauces was quite frustrating.  I recommend picking up the takeout menu at the front door and using that to navigate the menu.3.)  The service: Awkward but very friendly.  Our waiter seemed like a foodie fit for a restaurant like this, but his table presence left us feeling like we needed to make *him* comfortable talking to us or requesting anything.  I had to fight most of the meal to have more than 3-other ice cubes in my iced tea.  After asking a couple members of the staff for a glass of ice, they kept bringing back my glass with just more tea and no more ice. At one point, the server brought my iced tea glass back without a straw.  When I asked for one, his reply was "can you use the one from your water glass for now?"4.)  The food:  This is what made up for most of the other shortcomings especially because Chick is still new.  I had the country pork with creamed corn and mashed potato "bar".  You get 3 toppings with the mashed potato which the chefs will assemble for you.  I chose mesquite sour cream, applewood smoked bacon, and Vermont white cheddar - Delicious!  The creamed corn was very tasty as well.  The mandarin orange chutney paired amazingly well with the pork.My husband had the chicken and dumplings.  It's a little different from the traditional C&D, but was very good.  It's served in a lighter broth instead of a heavy sauce which was a welcome change.We decided next time the hubby and I go, we would take our chances at the bar and avoid the servers until they can get caught up on their service skills.
other The PERFECT Breakfast :)  If only I could have this every day :)Matt's is all you want a breakfast spot to be...cute, friendly and the most amazing food out there.I highly recommend the hog and chick.  You just can't go wrong with eggs*, bacon*, home fries* (get the home fries, not the hashbrowns) and their toast* served with Terra Verde Farms preserves.  * = best ever, ever, everI could write on and on...you've seen the reviews.  Just make sure to make it there, you won't be sorry, you'll be addicted!
3 Met some friends here for happy hour the other day.  This is the old El Paso BBQ and they did a knockout job with the remodel. Great feel and warm colors to the place now.I had a couple of Coronas and some chips and guacamole.  The regular menu looks better than the happy hour menu and think I'll try them the next time for lunch or dinner.
other There's a special little place in my heart designated specifically for JoBot, so I'm thrilled to be the 100th person to get to sing the praises of this adorable little coffee shop/creperie/hole-in-the-wall bundle of amazing-ness.I came across JoBot by accident about a year ago while looking for a late night wi-fi spot to do some studying. It fit the bill perfectly, minus the fact that it was extremely difficult to concentrate with the loud music coming from the Lost Leaf, the interesting conversations that I couldn't help from overhearing, and the endless amount of scrumptious plates that kept parading past me. That said, I've made several "study" trips to JoBot since. While I may not be as productive as I would be at some of those quieter little coffee shops where everyone has their nose in a book or a laptop, I find that I always walk away a very happy camper, every time. Their crepes/tacos are delicious. All of them. Sometimes I feel as though the crepes are slightly undercooked, but once I dig inside to discover the tantalizing flavors that lie within, I tend to forget all about that. The root beer pork remains one of my faves followed by a strawberry/banana concoction for dessert. Yum, yum, yum.Go here if you want good coffee (the bumble bee is tasty), good eats, good conversation, good atmosphere, good prices, good entertainment, and free wi-fi at any and all hours (they don't seem to close on weekends). And if you're really feeling frisky head down a house or two for some NachoBot. Gosh I love this place.
other After having been here a few times, I would say most of the reviews were dead on. The waiter was a fill in from another of the chain restaurants. The poor guy was serving everyone (which wasn't that busy) running around cool headed, apologetic and super fast paced.  After "gonging" our announcement that we were there, a guy came to seat us about 10 or so minutes later. Sadly, we were told that he was the owner... Not too personable.  To be fair, they really never had great service in the few times I have been there. What keeps me infrequently coming back is their drunken noodles. They rock. We went also for the referral of the pumpkin curry entree. Both more than made up for the extremely slow service and normally unfriendly staff.Summary of the rest of the reviews... Fish tank and others looked really clean, though I have seen them horrible before. Bathroom was atrocious... Filthy and gross. Waiter gave me some napkins and sent a guy out to buy more . Walk to the bathroom was down a dark hallway, thankfully again the waiter helped out with that... Poor guy! He deserves to manage the place and a raise! Lol
other great salads and burgers!
other This was my first time "hiking" and we did it in flip flops.  We were here on a Saturday afternoon after going to the zoo.  There weren't really any signs telling us where to go and some of the parking was blocked off.  There also wasn't a trail head (which I thought was normal) so we just parked randomly in some ramada and walked up.  The view is amazing and probably only took us10 min to walk up there.  Definitely recommend going for a "hike" up here if you are in the area.
other Simply the best automotive repair place I've yet found in Phoenix. Honest, fair, and competent. I've taken three vehicles there for service over several years now and never been dissatisfied.
other Tasty Mexican food with reasonable prices.  Their breakfast burritos are quite large and filling.  I had the chorizo burrito, which also comes with potatoes and eggs.  It was pretty good, although I wish there were more chorizo in the burrito for the flavor of the meat to fully manifest itself.  I also tried some chimichanga, which was equally large and filling.  They also have very refreshing horchata.  The other nice detail about this restaurant is that they are open until midnight every day except Sunday, which is open until 10 P.M.
3 When Fresh & Easy started popping up everywhere, it was my new favorite go to place for quick and easy meals.  They have a great selection of ready made entrees and salads that beat going through the drive through. The fact that there were always excellent coupons to be received could have been a big factor in why I returned so often. Key word, WERE, I think they have lightened up on their coupon circulation!The problem started when I began to do my actual grocery shopping here.  They have great prices on a limited, but satisfactory, amount of grocery items.  Its the produce and veggies that are troublesome.  I find that they start to go bad after other or 3 days, which isn't very convenient or money saving when it means I am throwing half of what I buy away.  I am very conscious of expiration dates on items, and have even found myself throwing away items prior to their expiration.   So, unless your planning on cooking with your fresh items that day, I would avoid the produce and even some dairy and meat items. So what I am saying is, frozen, dry or canned stuff...I am pretty sure your safe with.This location in particular has also been my least favorite to visit as far as friendly staff.  I usually have to bag my own groceries....yeah, I know, self checkout keeps the prices down, however, when you have other or 3 staff members just hanging out by the registers with little or no people in line, it wouldn't hurt for someone to jump on bagging groceries...its a little customer service that may save someone from not returning!
3 other stars if you are rich and love to throw your wad aroundother star if you are on a budget and think plastic surgery is terrifying3 stars if you enjoy window shopping, gawking at the snobbery and mock the fact that some people will spend $3000 on a ugly brown canvas purse with little "LVs" printed on it because it makes you feel good about yourself.other stars if you go during a mega-sale weekend when the "normal mall chain stores" have clearance - (Bath and Body Works, Gap, Express, Dillards etc, but they also have an H&M)All in all, SFS is a sight to see for the good and for the bad.At the end of the day it makes me want to escape to hills where people put value on the important things in life and not what brand your sunglasses are.
other I am DONE with Classic Car Spa, their sub-par car washes, and their shady business partnerships.  Whatever you do, DO NOT get your windshield replaced by the Auto Glass Shop that Classic Car Spa allows on their premises. I am holding Classic Car Spa accountable for placing their customers in such close proximity to criminals. While these Auto Glass Shop men are friendly and seem helpful, it is a scam. They replaced my windshield (and hey, it cost me nothing b/c my insurance covers it) and put the glass in wrong THREE TIMES! After one week and many HOURS on the phone with them and my insurance company, they are still giving me the run around. So although it was free, I will now have to foot the bill for fixing their crappy craftsmanship. After trying in vain to get my windshield fixed by the Auto Glass Shop, I spoke with the manager of Classic Car Spa. I don't think I've ever met a manager with a more relaxed, "who cares?" attitude. That place is a joke. Except, I'm not laughing....
other As an Irish lass thru and thru, the promise of a cool Irish pub to get some grub and frosty guiness was enticing...and it delivered!  The food was great, our server was excellent, and they were able to accomodate our group of about 1other walkins without blinking an eye on a saturday evening (bonus points for that).  Their patio is really nice, lots of flowers and greenery and high stone walls that make you feel like you're in more of a garden than just off Mill Ave.Overall, great place to head with friends!
other We had a mixed experience at Happy Hour (HH) and dinner.  Quick summary follows.  Hits:+ Food was tasty.+ Ambiance was nice.Misses:- Waitress was never able to bring the "last call" round of HH she offered.  No explanation or apology.  - Asked if I "minded" anchovies on my salad.  I said "no," but didn't realize there would be an upcharge until the final bill came.- While in the bathroom, observed one of the staff go straight from the stall (not the urinal) to the Kitchen.  No hand-washing, not even a pause by the sink.  ¡Buen apetito!
other Rude, rude, rude. I will *never* go back to this place. I don't normally carry cash and when I went to pick up my son's pants for his recital that night, I was in a little bit of a jam (they only take cash or checks). When I suggested they might put this on the claim ticket, or at least mention it when people drop off their clothes, the owner pointed to an itty bitty sign and told me "we have signs everywhere." The owner was hostile and argumentative and just didn't care about what I had to say. Then he hovered over me while my son tried his pants on, like I was going to steal something (the place is TINY). I went to an ATM and pulled out cash, it wasn't that big of a deal, but this place has no customer service skills whatsoever. I won't ever go there again. Steer clear.
other This is probably one of my favorite spots in Oldtown.  I definitely enjoy the the Thai food here and plus the atmosphere is really chill and homey.  Service was never a problem here every time I go.  My favorite is the Basil Crispy CK....so simple to make but I love it.  Date place? Sure why not :)
other EVERYONE loves to harsh on Arizona for being such a hateful place (including me!) However, I've had nothing but great service at the DMV!  Granted, my morning excursion today didn't get completed.  However it wasn't particularly crowded and I got to talk to the woman at the information desk within a minute of entering.  Rather than direct me to another line to wait, she troubleshot my issue quickly, and even APOLOGIZED when she said I would have to go talk to my bank to clear things up before getting my title.  Compared to DMV service in California, Arizona DMV is HEAVEN!!!
other So I was pretty excited about this burger joint opening since it's President Obama's favorite... The burger was good. Not great, not bland, just okay. My biggest hang up with this restaurant are the prices! Skip the beverage... it's very over priced. I was also not impressed with the fries- regular or cajun. They were pretty average as well. Stick with the burger and skip the rest is my suggestion to you.
3 The hole in the rock was pretty interesting, but only for about other minutes. It's not a hike at all, more of a walk on unpaved ground. Once you're up there, the view is pretty cool, but the crowds of people and rowdy kids and dogs detract from the magnificence and romance. I'd think it's a great place to take kids, though, because of how easy it is. Good thing it's located in Papago Park so you can go and see the zoo or the gardens or Hunt's Tomb while you're there. If you go just to see the hole, it's kind of a waste of time.
other Been there, done that.  Fair sandwiches (better than Safeway, anyway).  Only other stars since I didn't know about the free soft serve, so didn't get to try that.There's gotta be a good New York-style deli west of the 17 and north of Thunderbird.  Isn't there?  Doesn't have to be great.  Good would be wonderful.
other Family-run restaurant that serves extremely yummy Iraqi food. Go up to the register if you want take-out and they will help you figure out exactly what you want. The cook is very friendly and can do extra stuff for you just let him know exactly what you're looking for. If you're staying in the restaurant to eat, they have fast service and its always served hot. Very good food!
other As a west coast girl, knowing what good soul food consisited of never my forte. Then I moved to Atlanta for almost a year...driving...so i got to experience diff states in the souths sould food.  Collared greens always sounded scary to me and if you werent tuna, salmon or something i usually find on my sushi menu...you are prob a fish i havent bothered to give a chance :)well after having fried catfish with some great traditional sides while in Nashville, then again while living in ATL, i feel i can give a better opinion.Living in AZ, I was weary to even attempt to find some soul food.  But after reading some Yelp reviews, I decided Off Da Hook was worth a shot.   And thank goodness, because their catfish was amazing, collards were great and red beans and rice phenomenal.  Needless to say, i'll be back.  If you are in AZ and appreciate great soul food, then maybe ill run into you :)
3 Sandwiches are pretty decent and tasty..however..they don't include drinks, salad, just a small cookie on the side. We just ordered other sanwiches and other sodas, a little on the overpriced side, totaled out to $27 just for that. The sandwiches are gigantic or anything. just left feeling a bit hungry and disappointed.
other I cannot get enough of LGO.My favorite time to come is very early in the morning to enjoy the sun coming up over Camelback Mountain while having some organic coffee and a blackberry bran muffin.The breakfast at LGO has something for everybody, IMO. Try the Croque M'Dame if you want something really bold. The lunch and dinner options are great too. This is the only restaurant I have ever been that I could eat all three meals and feel like I was being served from a different kitchen each time.The only draw back I can think of for LGO is the tendency for it to become very crowded. That's the best problem a restaurant can have, so they're probably not too worried about it. The parking situation can become an issue too, but for my time and money, it's worth it.LGO is top notch in my book and you can find me there pretty regularly.
other Copper Star is a great example of adaptive use in the heart of the Melrose curve. Who would have thought that a building initially designed to provide fuel to cars would so work so well serving fuel to humans?Their coffee is locally roasted and, while not my favorite, is well above average in Phoenix. Their drive-thru is a great feature for those mornings when I'm running late. For the coffee adverse, Copper Star serves chai, tea, smoothies, Italian sodas, and some unique drinks including a black cherry limeade. Foodwise, there is a wide selection of baked goods,including some of the best bagels. They also have decent lunch offerings, such as sandwiches and a tasty hummus platter. But where they shine is their 'home baked' cupcakes. (I've seen Mayor Gordon here on several occasions getting his cupcake fix!) Despite being in a converted gas station/garage, the atmosphere is quite a bit more cozy than most of the other coffee shops in central Phoenix. While the sandblasted block walls and exposed ceiling let that building's industrial past peak through, this is offset by rotating art work and selection of comfortable (if a bit dingy) couches and easy chairs as well as small bistro tables and long 'work' tables to choose from. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the owner, Bill, is a great neighborhood resource. He can tell you anything and everything going on along 7th Ave.All in all a good place to grab a coffee and cupcake,  meet a friend or get some old fashioned reading done. I can't recommend it for serious work requiring internet access, however, as the wifi access remains intermittent at best.
other Quality offering at a reasonable price? Check.Burgers fresh and cooked the way they were meant be cooked? Check.Great fries- other kinds no less? Check.This is a tweener restaurant-perfect for a great casual dinner. Not too expensive. Not cheap and greasy. Just right for that one day of the week when you want something in between.Enjoy.
other The two things that jettison my brain into a Barrio Cafe daydream are:1)  The Sangrita2)  The Churro dessertIn fact, if this place was called "Barrio Sangrita and Churro Shop", i would still want to run up to the building and give it a big hug.Really, enough has been said here about the food, or atmosphere, or whatevs ... but if they're hoping to leave a legacy in Phoenix, its with these two items.I prefer going to BC for brunch on Sunday.  I enjoy that menu the best.  Oh, and the table side Guac is a nice touch.
other True fine dining has come to the Valley.If you are looking to have a special dinner, this is the place.  And plan on spending 3 hours as it is a true culinary experience.The tasting menu consists of options of 4, 5, or 6 courses, and they can be paired with wine, if you like.  This is the way to go and even for tasting portions, they are not micro-mini.The choices for each course are extensive.  At least 6-10 each.  AND, the coolest part, is that you won't find any ingredient repeated twice.  NONE.  Yes you might find tomatoes in the same night, but they won't be the same type.  That's not easy to pull off, considering the variety of the menu.But, while you are between courses, Chef Binkley will send out numerous amuse bouche - which, if you don't know, are tiny little one bit or one gulp appetizers like, mini sliders the size of a half dollar, or pancetta mousse in a shot glass.We ate there for my ex-H's bday, and had 8 amuse bouche.  Also, if you let them know in advance you are there for a special occasion, you will get custom printed menus for everyone at the table mentioning the special event.The ONLY drawback, is the atmosphere.  It definitely doesn't fit the quality and beauty of the food.  But, I still give it a 5, as the food is superb.If you are a true foodie GO. I was excited the whole meal, as I couldn't wait to see what came out next!   If you are a meat and potatoes type with an uneducated palate, save your time and money, since you won't appreciate the menu at all.
other I've spent more time than I need to remember in hotel bars and restaurants, and they all kind of fade into a blurry, nebulous, mass. District, however, stands out.From their pork sliders and bacon wrapped dates on happy hour, to their cold and juuust right gin martinis, I don't think they hit a flat patch the whole week I was there, and I stopped by at least once a day. The bartender I had, Matt, was funny, smart, sweet, and made me feel like I had a friend in Phoenix. The experience was more than I could have asked for from a hotel restaurant, and if I stay in the area again I will definitely go back.
other great happy hour.  always comfortable, nice staff. we'll return often.
3 The Arizona Science Center offers a series of programs called adult's night out  which are held the first Friday of every month. These lectures cover focused overviews on topics ranging from Genetics and Nanotechnology to Native American medicinal utilization of native plants found in the Southwest. There is always interesting science or engineering content but the value and interest of the talks is essentially the somewhat direct non-mass-media poisoned or dumbed down views of the individual speakers themselves. While I would attend the talks regardless I have found additional value in the evening because of the extended hours that the science center offers which allows you to catch an IMAX film and see the latest flavor of exhibit (Body Worlds, Titanic, etc.) after the lecture. I would have loved to have given the Science Center other stars but I am constantly annoyed by the science center's staff inability to get one of the three microphones set up correct for the speakers ahead of time causing a speaker to waste 5-10 minutes every month.Beer and wine are available for purchase during the event. The adult's night out lectures are free, normal planetarium, IMAX, and special exhibit prices still apply.Arizona Science Center Web Site:www.azscience.orgAdult's Night Out:www.azscience.org/adults_night_out.php
other Beatiful setting and good service. However, that doesn't make up for the $1other burger which was average at best and all three of ours were over cooked.
other The BEST brewery I've ever been to. Amazing beer and awesome food (I didn't think that combo was actually possible)! I daydream about this place all the time since I spent so much time here while going to school at ASU. Whenever I go back to Phoenix, this is always a must on my list!
other The only thing I like about Fez are the pomegranate margaritas. Food could be better...
other Neat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This place is like a trip to a non-petting zoo and aquarium and aviary while you dine on fairly decent Mexican food.  I was here for a late brunch and didn't wait at all.  I was near a window that right on the pond, and just about every turtle in the pond crawled out to come on over and see what the Rock was cooking and how I was enjoying it... no joke, see pic!The ducks and geese were very active in the lagoon, showing off for all the diners, and it thrilled the kids to pieces.  The guacamole is decent and the 3 types of salsa you're given were all good in their own ways.  If anything, swing in here for the atmosphere.  I bet its awesome at night.
other I love Thai food. And I like it hot. Thai Lahna wraps these two expectations up in a perfect package. It's the most authentic Thai food in the Valley! Like so many culinary jewels in the Valley, the restaurant is nestled in a strip mall between a tanning salon and a yoga studio. The tables are covered in the same silks that I brought back with me from my own Thailand adventure and the staff is super friendly.  I am addicted to the hot and sour soup with chicken. It's served piping hot with tons of vegies and even more flavor. I always choose the lemon grass flavor, but I'm sure the coconut one is equally delectable. The Green Curry (#71) is also a favorite because I'm a big fan of bamboo shoots. I usually get it with chicken. I also love the #5other (which I can't actually pronounce, yet alone spell) with beef.   For lunch, the #6 will change your life. I like it with chicken and a TALL glass of water. I always order is spicy but for the faint of heart I would recommend going with the mild version.  I generally order takeout but dining in is also a fun experience. I have not had one bad meal here and the price point is right on! Take a group of friends and have fun!
other I can't stand 50's retro but this place is the cuteness. Well...I haven't technically been inside. Now, I knew this was a hipster hangout, but I wasn't expecting the cute girl in the apron or the boy with tattoos to actually be working on the other side of that window. They didn't seem to mind that I was slightly drenched in sweat having walked there under the sun of a blazing March afternoon. They were quite nice and gave my sister and I a bowl of water for our doggies. Tattoo boy said he would even make us more fries if we wanted. The fries ($2) were not the best  and neither was my grilled cheese ($4) with tomato (yum!) and pickles (?). However, the food had a nice home-made quality to it and was all ready in about a minute. Peeps are right about the high-quality ingredients and the food is inexpensive. Holler.P.S. Don't forget the Ca$hM0nayyyor to borrow from a sibling!
other I WISH I LIVED IN SCOTTSDALE. I stopped by Yogurtland because I went to Spring Training, and I wish I could have stayed forever. The quality of the frozen yogurt is impeccable. So many flavors! I mixed Raspberry Cheesecake with Vanilla Bean, also tried the PB&J flavor (um, YES!?), Tangerine Tango, and my usual go-to, Tart. Very extensive toppings bar. Good price as well, I just love froyo. Next time I'm in Scottsdale, this will be one of the first places I go to!
other Very pleasant hip restaurant. Try as many Bruchetta options as you can; each order comes with other pieces (potentially other different toppings), and all the ones I got were delicious: Brie & Apples with Fig Spread, Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, and Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil.
other They have a new and improved menu and added more Korean dishes. Very good!!! I've been there other times since they added the new menu, and it's been good every time. Very authentic Korean food. This is my favorite spot now!! The dishes I had so far:Champong, Bulgogi, Sul-lung-tang, Neng-myun, Galbi, Yukgejang. All were very good. I can't wait to go back and try other food! Neng-myun (cold noodle) was especially good on muggy hot summer days.
other This Mexican restaurant has the best burritos in town!  This is not your roach infested 2other hour drive through kind of burrito joint either.  Here are the reasons that make La Tolteca #other and one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix!1-Full bakery with mouth watering fresh pastries2-Fresh ingredients and great prices3-Also serves beer if you feel like having a Corona with your meal as opposed to take out4-Little market has the best prices in town on citrus fruits and just enough of everything to cook up a little Mexican meal (Ranch Market not needed!)5-Make your own pico/ salsa bar, make it your style and get as much of it as you want:)So, if you are downtown looking for authentic Mexican this is the place.  Of course it is super casual take out or seat yourself kind of place so don't  try to flatter your date here! But get there early, I'm pretty sure they close up shop by 9 or 10...
other What a wonderful night. It didn't start out that way. I found this restaurant on yelp, not realizing that it was sixteen miles from the hotel my wife and i were staying at. I heard the grief all the way there. "Come on honey, it's an adventure!". We arrived, and were greeted warmly and shown right to our table. Zach, our waiter, was right there to offer us drinks and appetizers. We had the Summer Rolls and they were delicious! I explained to  Zach that I was allergic to wheat and he brought us a special "gluten free" menu the owner had created for those of us who are allergic to wheat. Zach even brought us some special wheat-free dipping sauce for the Summer rolls. He showed great care, provided great customer service,  and the sauce  was delicious!The portions were good sized and the presentation was beautiful. But the wonderful tastes and personal service made the night special. Oh, the bathrooms were clean too. Thanks Zach, and thanks Malee's. It was a great night my wife and I look forward to repeating. (Yes, she admitted after dinner that the drive was worth it.)
other Excellent cheap Mexican food that tastes as good as any Mexican restaurant.
3 Great service. Good food. Had baked scallops. Reasonable prices
other I've been to multiple Buca di Beppo locations in several cities.  They are a good place to go with a large group.  We went to this location with a group of nine.  The menu was typical.  We ordered the seafood trio, which was nice, and the fried mozzarella, which was also good.  The Caesar's salad was also good.  We ordered pasta entree's and chicken, all of which were served up warm and in plentiful portions.  We left with a fair amount of food.  I would give the food four stars.  However, I would give the service one star.  Two in our party ordered cocktails.  Five of us ordered wine with dinner.  All drinks arrived together with our entrees.  We did not get enough dinner plates.  We did not get enough wine glasses, and had to wait for three more.  Three entrees arrived together, and we had to wait about five minutes for the fourth to arrive.  We had to ask three times for boxes to put our leftovers in.  We were never asked if we wanted dessert.  If the service were spot on, the rating would be much higher, but, I can't justify it.
other My husband and I have been going to the Touch of Thai for years. We meet up there at least twice a month for a lunch date. On special occasions we take friends and family there for dinner. I love the wait staff - especially Nick! His wonderful sarcasm and jokes always make our day! For the amount of food you get at lunch at the price they charge - you can't beat it. Everything is homemade and tastes fresh. #3 Yellow Curry is my hubby's favorite. Rich coconut based sauce with yellow curry. The chicken is tender and the potatoes and carrots are cooked perfectly. I venture off and try things from time to time. The food is spicy. I like the incorporation of fresh herbs into the dishes. The soup served with lunch is always yummy and changes from time to time. We always get a side order of spring rolls. You need to try these! I like the Pad Thai as well as the #other and #7 lunch specials. Meals are served fairly quickly. Sometimes we have to get up and refill our own water glasses however I find this to be a wee bit charming. Feels like I am home. If you go there on a regular basis the servers remember you, have your order into the kitchen before you even are seated, and always say hello and smile.
other This place was messy and loud.  The food really wasn't great and the salsa bar looked like a three year old put it together.  Overall the only plus was the tortilla chips that were free before the food.  I will not be back unless one of my friends pays for me
other Had the super burger and fries tonight... excellent! I like that while they do have some tv's on with sports on them... the housemusic takes front stage.  Might be different on big playoff nights.Also... the tequila thyme drink... delicious and actually had some alchyhol in it!  Fantastic!
other Great service, good beer, AMAZING burger and yummy sweet potato fries.  This place is an awesome bar food venue with a cool interior design, not too pricey or pretentious.
other OK, so I haven't been to a buffet in a long time.  When I reflect on the idea of buffets -- Sweet Tomatoes excluded, since lots of salad means lots of Good-For-You-ness, right?... --  I feel like I used up my lifetime maximum instances of buffet-eating in college, where the dining halls were all-you-can eat.  Anyway, this place just opened and is within walking distance of where I live, so my neighbors and I decided to check it out.  Overall I wasn't very impressed with the food, even in comparison to other Chinese food buffets I've been to in the past.  In addition to a standard selection of Chinese buffet items (beef with broccoli, fried rice, sweet and sour chicken) they have sushi, pizza (for kids, I'm assuming), and a hibachi grill section where you can pick vegetables and meats and they'll stir fry it for you (included in the buffet price).  The hibachi stir fry I made up was OK, but the sauce added to it was too salty for me.  The sushi was bland and what you would expect from a grocery store.  They only had regular high-sodium soy sauce, as far as I could tell.  (I tried asking one of the wait staff for low-sodium soy sauce and there was a language barrier; he brought back another staff member to our table, who also didn't understand what I was asking.)  The egg roll I tried was really salty (even without sauce) and nothing to write home about.  Usually sweet & sour sauce can make even mediocre egg rolls worth eating, but the S&S sauce on the buffet was a downright-scary Kool-Aid-red color.  However, the fresh pineapple and melon was a nice touch, as were the 8 different ice cream flavors on the far end of the line.I will say it was pretty cheap at $10 per adult, so if you're looking for a lot of food on a budget, it might be a decent option for you.  Personally though, I just think I am past the days of eating foods with scary salt levels, artificial colors, etc., so I won't plan on going back (though if I had to return for some reason, there are enough edible options so that I wouldn't starve).
3 Jersey Mike's is okay. It's a chain place, and a bit over priced for fast food.  I ordered a philly cheese steak.  It was mostly bread, with a few thing microscopic slices of meat.  A little cheese too.  And a sliver or two of peppers.  But mostly, it was bread.  I think it's funny the people that work here try to make small talk with you.  "So, what are you guys up to tonight?"  I think it would be fun to just try and f*#k with them, and say something like, "Oh you know, smoking a little meth and just chilling with some hookers."  See what they say to that.
other I love Tempe Marketplace and frequent it regularly.  It has many dining, shopping, and entertainment options.  It is an outdoor mall and in the summer there are misters and in the winter heat lamps and a large fire pit.  It has stores that are usually only found in malls such as Tilly's, American Eagle, and Victoria's Secret, but also freestanding stores such as Target, Best Buy, and Ulta.  There are a large variety of restaurants and a Harkin's Movie Theater as well.  It is a great place to hang out with friends and see the local night life!
other We stayed at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak for four nights...ate here twice, and picked up food to go twice. Everything we had was tasty and well-done. I liked the New York Gorgonzola sandwich the best, as anything with creamy horseradish is spot on in my book. The au jus seemed better the first time I had it. We came back for s'mores with the kids one  night. We were kind of hoping to do the marshmallows over the fire pit outside but there were a few people who may have posted on here previously who looked at our kids in horror. The server rushed over and said they're not allowed to serve marshmallows over the fire pit -- they bring a small burner right to the table. We still had fun and the old fogies outside enjoyed their drinks in peace.Oh - prices are a bit on the high side but that's to be expected, i guess, at a resort. Bottom line - the food was good!
other I liked them a lot until I had to call them to get the discount fare for the toddler but since I was booking our tickets together (because a two year old legally can't fly alone so I HAD to) on the phone, I wasn't getting the lower internet rate.  That's extortion!  I'd much rather do the entire thing on the internet.  Then he tells me that the child's fare goes off of the regular rate which is only one dollar less than the internet rate.  What the hell?  Why would I ever want to sit on hold for 2other minutes to book a flight to get this crap?  Then they tried to get me to pay $1other more for the next class up (I know, upper class on Southwest - strange).  I asked what I got:  1.2other times the miles (yeah, you heard right 25% more - that's going to get me far), first boarding and a free drink.  I clarified that with a child I get to board first anyway (they confirmed this).  Then I asked how much a drink costs.  $5.  So essentially they are asking me to pay $1other instead of $other for a drink I may or may not want (then again, I'm traveling with a child so who am I kidding, I'm going to need a drink).  And to top it all off, they tell me we can't do on-line check in because Beckham doesn't have a picture ID.  I tell them but he does have a picture ID.  He has a passport, in fact he has two.  The Southwest person tells me no one has two passports so I tell him that no, it's true.  The toddler and I both have two as we have dual citizenship.  (Not that we would need them to fly to California so the whole conversation is entirely pointless now.)  The Southwest man being the all-knowing scholar he is tells me that's impossible and illegal.  I take a deep breathe, tell him he's right, I'm wrong, how stupid I am.  I must be thinking of my library card.    Why are things so difficult sometimes?
other As someone who LOVES Thai food, I can really appreciate a good Pad Thai, and Wild Thaiger's is my favorite hands down!Just like the menu says, their Pad Thai has a plethora of intense flavors, to the point where every bite is unique.  If you love Pad Thai and haven't tried Wild Thaiger's, you need to.  If you don't love Pad Thai, it's probably because you haven't tried Wild Thaiger's.  :)  Seriously, this is one of the best dishes I've found in Phoenix.Their other dishes are consistently good as well.  I love Chicken Satay, but most places only offer it as an appetizer, with a few skimpy chicken strips.  Wild Thaiger, on the other hand, has a filling Peanut Chicken lunch, as well as a Peanut Passion dinner, both drenched in their delicious peanut sauce.  Their curries are very flavorful and make for a superb and hearty dinner, but if you're going for lunch, you may want to consider Thai Basil up the road as their curry lunch combo includes a salad and other extras.Their Thai Tea is strong yet creamy, just like it should be, and you can even add boba to it.  A must if you're eating anything spicy.The service is very professional and timely.  The atmosphere is pretty classy, in fact, it's probably the nicest-looking Thai restaurant I've been to.  It's also the only Thai restaurant I can think of with a patio.  All in all, it has a very welcoming atmosphere.  I would feel just as comfortable here in a suit as I would a T-shirt and jeans.  It's a great place for dates, business lunches, or just some great take-out.  You might spend a tad bit more here than at some other nearby joints, but the quality more than makes up for it, I would say the prices are spot-on.One day I'll learn how to write a review that's short and sweet, but I kept thinking of good things to say about this place.  Highly recommended!
other My husband and I went there for lunch today and because of vegegirly C.'s review about the deep fried pickles guess what we ordered??? OMG they were amazing! We ordered the cajun style and man oh man were they goooooood! We have never even heard of them but I am so glad we got them. So crispy and so hot! Mmmmm (and 1/other priced)!!!We got greeted and seated quickly. I ordered the chicken brie sandwhich and my husband had the meatloaf sandwhich. I am not sure where the comment about small portions came from because they were good sized and we were both stuffed!The only change to the chicken brie would be to have the pears sliced thinner rather than having thick pears to bite through. Otherwise it was yummy.I also ordered the "Arizona Iced Tea" for the first time since they didn't have fresh mint to make my mojito. I was pleasantly surprised at how light and refreshing it was.We had the entertainment card which they didn't punch so we can use it again, and we will :)
other I heart Rome's Pizza!! Being a native New Yorker, I have struggled over the past two years to find anything remotely close to NY style pizza. I had tried many local, independent places, but no one got it right. When I moved back to Scottsdale about 6 months ago my guy and I passed this place driving down McDowell road. I figured we could try it out (I'm always on the look out for some yummy pizza). Don't be taken back by the empty parking lot and shabby exterior, after all, isn't it what's inside that counts?? The food is always fresh. The Greek salad is great - it comes in small and large. The pizza is amazing (as long as you know what you're getting - NY style). I know that it's family owned, which I always have an appreciation for. The man that owns it does most of the deliveries. When I first moved to the area I called for delivery and he had to call me because he couldn't find my street. Embarrassingly, I only knew the street I lived on and not much more, so I couldn't help him. He told me that it was okay and eventually found the house. I expected him to get out of the car and give me a huge attitude, thinking I'm an idiot because I didn't know where I lived (could you really blame him?). But he was as sweet as could be and told me it was no problem. How refreshing! In a nutshell, hoooorray for Rome's!!
3 So I was meeting some friends here last night for drinks for a friend's birthday. We were supposed to meet at 9:30 but it was around 10:30 when we actually got to the bar. We walked in and had our IDs checked and then stood around awkwardly...I'm not sure why this happened, but after a few minutes we were asked if we needed a table. Yup...that's why we're here. So we were seated near the bar. The place is large and the decor is fine, but the music they were playing was mainly from the 90's and made the place seem less 'hip' I guess, not that I know much about being hip. We waited for about other minutes for anyone to acknowledge us. The waiter finally came by and took our drink order. I got the agave basil margarita ($8.50) which was soooo good! I was very happy with the drink. The Birthday Girl got a blueberry bliss... which wasn't what she was expecting. I tried it and thought it was good, but it was definitely more like wine than a mixed drink. The others got beers. So the real problem, for me at least, was my second drink. I got a tropical margarita ($7.00). It was one of the worst drinks I have ever had and was a challenge to drink. It was SO acidic and just nasty, I swear the two drinks could not have come from the same place...but they did. That's a huge red flag for me.Side note: Why do restaurants think it's cool to not price their signature drinks....why should I have to ask how much it costs? I find this completely ridiculous and annoying. The drinks didn't end up being very expensive here, but I feel like I should have that information available to me on the menu just like any other item.... *ok steps off soapbox*As far as food goes, one of my friends got a side of fries that were pretty good and came with bbq sauce, but other than that we did not eat. I have heard good things about their food from other people. After we were done with our second round of drinks (and the fries) we decided to move on to another bar.....but we couldn't because we had no check! Our waiter, who had been almost harassing us towards the beginning of our night, had completely disappeared. He finally came by like 10-1other minutes later and reeked of cigarettes....there is no way he only smoked one because I could almost taste it...pretty gross for a waiter. Anyway, our checks were brought fairly quickly after that and we were finally able to leave.  Conclusion: Be very careful what you order....it is a total mixed bag.
other I unashamedly adore this place.  And it's not b/c I spend gobs of money here... it is b/c I don't have to drive and zig zag all over the Valley to sample (and decide if I like) many of our infamous local food offerings...Essence's macaroons from Tempe, Tammie Coe cupcakes and MJ's breads (what I always look fwd to) from CenPho, growing selecting of gelatos from all the places you read about... it's a one stop sample shop (ok, you pay for it), and a place I always hit when I'm up in N. Scottsdale.The $other cheese boxes are great, a mini variety of 3 cheese in their to-go section is a great way to try new cheeses w/out risk.
other I used Full Circle Auto Body after my daughter's car was in an accident. They were very knowledgable and helpful about insurance issues and got the car repaired quickly. They post progress of your vehicle with photos on their website which is so cool. I'll definitely use them again if the occassion arises.
other Five stars, five1st  star Culinary excellence,2nd star Service perfection3rd star Atmosphere and history4th star flawless operation 5th star dessert-other star, management need not say more.,  Old School Style fine dinning.  This restaurant dates way back to the early days of downtown Phoenix.
other Well, i was very excited to go to this event, however, not so excited when it was all over. The music was great and it is a very nice place. It really reminds me of Vegas. However, it  was fashion week and we all thought that we would see models sashaying down the runway. But, no. No fashion at all. The wine was comp and it was very good ,i give great praise for that!  But the samples of food were few and far between. The Servers skipped out many times. Not like most Yelp events which are usually out the door GREAT!  We ordered from the happy hour menu.  I fully agree lots of salt, but i think it was the soy sauce, it was the most salty..i have ever had. There is very little parking here as well so be prepared for that as well.  All in all we had a good time.But, not as fabulous as most Yelp events.
3 Service was faster than some of the other (but better) Indian restaurants I have been to in the area. The food was so-so. Nothing special. I enjoy spicy Indian food, but the "hot" was not. The only reason we ate there was the buy one get one free in the Phoenix area coupon book... no that, was a good value.
other We had a restaurant.com coupon.  They also have happy hour specials on appetizers.  You cannot combine specials with the coupon.We started with edamame and mussels.  I have never had mussels before, just oysters and clams.  The mussels were eff'in awesome.  They were not super chewy and the way they were seasoned and served, spicy and bold, was seriously amazing.Three of us polished off three different rolls.  Spicy tuna crunch roll, over the top.  What the heck roll, another spicy roll that was seriously good as H€LL!  Screaming roll, spicy tempura style shrimp roll with a delicious crunch.  Spicy is the way to go with sushi rolls.For dessert we went with mochi ice cream, served in four flavors: vanilla, strawberry, green tea and mango.  The green tea and mango were my favorites.Such a good dinner, now if only they served alcohol.
other I went here with my mom while my dad had a dinner meeting. The atmosphere is hip but it's also got a mature setting. It is a really great place for young adults and even older ones. The price was good, the food was amazing! The portions were also big and MOST the staff was friendly. I overheard two rude staff members making fun of the customers. However they might not even work there anymore. Great place!
other Ask for Alex - he is very helpful and knowledgeable with products in the store. He is a young college student and works part time but always has a great attitude and finds the best deals for our family. Thanks Alex!
other Market Bistro never leaves me disappointed. The people are great.The food is ALWAYS good & it doesn't matter what you get, they will cater to your needs & wants.Definitely a must if your coming to Phoenix or if you live here, you need to try it.
3 Unlike a lot of the other reviewers, I actually had a decent experience here. We came in yesterday (Sunday) around 2. The place was pretty quiet, excluding the plethora of football fans who came here to watch their games. They have a ton of TVs to do so, including a HUGE screen that was playing the Cardinals game. No complaints about that. Some of the guys were rowdy but hey so am I when I watch football. It took us a while to be seated. I'm not quite sure where the hostess was. As soon as we were seated we were helped by a very pretty and sweet girl. Our food took a while even though the place was pretty dead, but what we got was satisfying. We started with the nachos which were really good and then I got their jalapeno burger and my friend got their pork sandwich sliders. The fries were seasoned well and crispy. The service needs some work: nonexistent hostesses, disappearing servers, slow cooks, but this place could be a real gem.
3 This place was kinda cool. We first got there around 9:30 on a saturday night. The place was dead... but that is to be expected for a "night club". The drinks are expensive, but tasty. The decor is AMAZING. The couches are comfy and there is just enough seating space without it overtaking the joint. We ended up leaving after other drink and went back a few hours later and the place was busy busy busy. They had great music playing and the dance floor was full. One downfall was, I hate when you go to a bar and the bathroom has an attendant that you need to tip. They are holding everything that you need... soap and paper towels. I feel that I shouldnt feel forced to tip someone because I wanted to wash my hands after I used the bathroom. Overall the place was decent. I am new in town and I am sure that there are better places to have a drink. I will most likely go back (in the future), just not in a rush to.
other My sister in law and her fiance took us to Jimmy Johns after discovering it. The location is really convenient to us, which is great.I enjoyed my sandwich. The branding is a little intense. EVERYTHING, right down to the chips, is branded with the Jimmy John's logo. It's all good but it's a little crazy.The sandwiches are big and the cookies they sell by the register are huge! Prices don't seem too bad either. A nice sandwich stop.
other The price is right! 16 bucks for two huge lunches, chips & salsa and two drinks.If you're looking for upscale, squeaky clean and Scottsdalish, this ain't your place. If you're looking for good Mexican food, at reasonable prices, quick service and great flavor head on over to Carolina's.
other Another great Italian find!My BF and I went to Roma Garden for dinner last night because he was given a gift certificate there from a friend.  We'd never heard of it, but we're always up for trying something new, especially with $50 towards our meal.  We pulled up to their strip mall location without expectations and we were both pleasantly surprised!When you walk in, the lighting and decor are welcoming and the staff is friendly and attentive.  It was a Thursday night and there were plenty of other guests in the restaurant, and there was a lively energy in the air.  After browsing the menu, I ordered one of the few 'Chef's Specials' of the night - tilapia with fresh veggies and pasta in a lemon caper sauce.  BF went with Pollo Parmagiana.  He had a glass of cabernet and I had pinot grigio... and voila - a warm bread basket arrived on our table at just the right time!We were both happy with our orders when they arrived as well... the fish was cooked just right and the sauce was tasty... good portions as well!  Although we were full, we decided to order a dessert to share - the homemade snow white chocolate tartufo - yum!  The perfect sweet ending to our meal.  In addition, we were each brought an after dinner drink of amaretto on the rocks, on the house.****I just have to share that I was pleasantly surprised that the women's restroom was clean, spacious, and had a fresh fragrance to it - I normally don't notice that, but I was impressed by this!In speaking to the waiter and the owner, we learned that this restaurant recently changed locations but they've been in business for over 1other years.  Gotta love the local businesses that last in the valley... we'll be back to support Roma Garden and enjoy their fine "Northern Italian Cuisine" without a doubt.  I suggest you go check it out also - bon appetito!
other Tasty, large portion, culinary delight appetizers.More of a bar than a restaurant, but the food was good & trending artisanal.
other Awesome place.I am pretty sure that this is my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. Honeycomb, radishes, and a huge heap of rainbow valley butter for an appetizer? what?! Whaat? I had to take a picture of it. The waitress gave me a hard time about this, but she was cool :pMy coworkers and I went on a mission to try everything here. I do remember the brussel sprouts being too salty. but everything else was great. spicy broccoli...fat-fat cooked potatoes....perfectly grilled ribeeyeeeee.. .yummm..but i dooo remember the brussel sprouts being a bit too salty for me.. but i forgave them for this. In addition to the great food, it's a cute little restaurant with a lot of character. The servers (who are also your bartenders - i thought this was a bit interesting) are really friendly. Good memories here!
other I was very impressed with the service and food. St Francis provided a delicious meal and beautiful ambiance that was just right for a group of clients after work.
other unless you hate ice cream and friendly people you will love Papa Ed's! It's tucked away in Caitlin Court in downtown Glendale.  Walking towards the front you can't help but notice all the love and care that went into the garden and flowers - the flower bed still makes me smile!  Walking through the front door it's easy to forget where and when you are - the wood floors, Vintage coke machine and friendly staff all most made me forget why I was there... ICE CREAM. good selection and great ice cream.. Now let's talk about ice cream pie... Papa Ed's makes to order (with advance notice) ice cream pies. I love the Peanut butter cup with Oreo cookie crust. The lemon and Raspberry sorbet swirl in a  graham cracker crust and my Holiday Favorite - Pumpkin Pie Ice Cream in a graham cracker crust!
other If you have dietary restrictions or are insanely health-conscious (like me), YOU MUST TRY NOURISH.This is an amazing culinary experience for two reasons. First, if you are looking for exceptionally healthy food or have dietary-restrictions, you have a multitude of yummy choices.  The organic-y menu ranges from special dietary needs (Gluten-free, Egg-free, Dairy-free, etc.) to proteins from Vegan to Free-Range Meats.   All foods are well marked for dietary-restrictions.   Yesterday, we had a great roasted chicken and hamburger (gf bun--burger was a bit bland and dry but wifey was happy just having meat, since I do the cooking for us.)  The quinoa is quite tasty too.  The sweet potato-avacodo salad is great, as are the fries.  The 'free' cucumber water is very refreshing, to which I have adopted having a pitcher in my own kitchen.The second reason the kitchen is REALLY COOL is that it is a COLD kitchen, with no ventilation.  Food is pre-cooked in kilm-like ovens, then when ordered, the prep work is to put into 800 degree Air-Fryers (and yes, no oil is used, it's an air dryer that looks like a jet-turbine engine).  It makes awesome fries and crispy skins on chicken.  Some done-ness variation does occur in this process; nonetheless, it works well for restaurants with not exhaust.p.s.  Thanks for the tour.
other I'm usually one to prefer chicken - but when the only option for tacos is steak you go with it.  I ordered the taco and was rewarded with tender steak with lots of flavor.  Our lunch crew has gone back several times and the service is always fast and friendly.  For the size and price - order multiples.  Love the salsa bar.  Adding cucumbers is now my favorite treat.
other I have been to this course a few different times.  The summer deals brought me in because it is a little pricey during the season.  The greens and fairways have always been in good condition and I enjoy the challenging hills and strategically placed bunkers.  I haven't really scored well on this course but as a beginner golfer I enjoy the challenge this course offers. Water jugs on every tee is crucial for the summer months.
other Awesome country club. Great new remodled gym, heated Olympic pool for year round use.  Love the family like atmosphere, plenty of planned family events/pool parties. Only complaint, wish members who didn't pay for the monthy tennis membership could still rent a court on a need by need basis.   Regardless courts are top notch, great facilities and friendly staff.
other I had initially checked this place out a couple of months ago.  Once again we found ourselves needing some quick, delicious breakfast and decided to try this place out again.  As before it was absolutely delicious.  The one thing that surprised me this time around however was the little play area toward the back of the restaurant.  This is very impressive to me as it gave us some much needed peace prior to getting our food.  Thank you Bertha's Cafe for not only being so accommodating, but also for having such wonderful food.
other It's a beautiful day.  Clear sky and around 6other degrees in the late morning!  What to do?  My little guy had been riding his bike without training wheels.  Woo-hoo!  Is he ready to go on a dirt trail?  We're gearing him up to go mountain biking up North.  Hubby suggested Riparian Preserve.  It was an excellent choice.  "This is awesome!"  my little one exclaimed, as he bounced up and down on the trail.  Then, he'll just stop right in front of me without warning.  Five year olds get distracted so easily.  "Is that a wasp?  Look at that hover fly!  What kind of ant is that?  What kind of beetles live here!"  asks my little future entomologist.   We'll be taking some tours and classes the Riparian offers soon!My little one did bite the dust several times due to some excessively gravelly paths.  He learned to either walk his bike over or slow down a bit.  Such a sport!  "Let's come back here again.,  That was fun!"  It was fun for us too!We're so lucky we live not far from here.  It is a very well maintained park.  As it gets hotter, we would walk and feed the ducks in the morning and spend the rest of the time in the Regional Library.  I highly recommend you check this place out.
other Are there food that is NOT-true ?OK... I got it, food has to be true to the original taste ... which mean it doesn't always taste good, I supposed .... Had the Shrimp spring rolls .... Turkey Bolognese ... could be true to the ingredient but not true to the dish of how it should taste.... Fit very much in the north scottsdale vibe .... 'look at me, I only eat healthy, organic, true and whole food' ...  which actually could be a good thing ;)
other Amazing sandwhich joint. A must go place to eat!
other Walking into this place is just plain confusing.  You could tell it used to be something different, but I've got no idea what.  I guess it doesn't matter.  It just sort of looks cheap.  But that's ok.The food was right on, and I'll be back for more.  Bento Box A?  Yes please.  Small salad with a great ginger-type dressing, some sort of spicy beef, teriyaki chicken, rice, egg roll, some edamame, a few carrots... am I missing anything?  The service was great, the food even better, and it only set me back about other minutes and 8 bucks.  It seems like a sure bet, and close enough to work for a good take out that it will rise toward the top of my list.
other Rental car review.118 degrees.  Standing outside in the heat waiting for a bus.  10 minutes go by and I have seen 3 busses leave with out of service signs.  Another 10 minutes pass and no active duty busses.  Finally, a bus!  We have a packed bus and the driver is just standing outside.  other minutes later he comes back on the bus and we drive 10 miles an hour the whole way to the terminal.PHX...pay attention.  Business travelers do not appreciate being left in the heat for 20 minutes watching out of service busses pass by.
other Most horrible buffet I have ever been to.My boyfriend and I are big chinese buffet fans. A ton of them have raised their prices recently (and, not surprisingly, have been closing down left and right).. so the prospect of a good buffet at 5-8 dollars was absolutely amazing. We read all the reviews on yelp and I had high hopes.Dear lord. The food is awful here. Inedible. Tastes very distinctly like a bad frozen dinner.  The only thing I remember being remotely food-like was some kind of beef and onion dish.. which tasted a bit like a philly cheesesteak. not exactly asian fare..I tried really hard to like this place. My boyfriend didn't like any of it either. I don't understand how they have such good ratings. The ONLY thing I like about this place is their dessert bar, because they have toppings for the frozen yogurt. It always annoyed me how so many buffets don't even have sprinkles.. so they've got that going for them.. though I think I'll just go to Mojo or Yogurtland. haha.In short, I don't understand how anyone can eat this garbage.
3 I will start with our experience from the time we walked in. The customers sitting in the restaurant stared and some laughed. I guess we missed the whites only sign on the front door. However my husband and I love to try new things and don't care what people think. The hostess however was nice and pleasant. Our waiter was also great.  The food here was delicious for an appetizer we had the stuffed mushrooms which were to die for. Our main entrees were the German meatloaf and my husband ordered the tenderloin. My whipped potatoes were so delicious. The cabbage was awesome not to sweet not to salty and the meatloaf was refreshing. My husband enjoyed his tenderloin and fries as well. It was seasoned perfectly.The skinny is if you don't mind being treated like the 13th amendment was never signed by the patrons of Haus Murphy's and want some Excellent German food this is the place to go. The staff here were great though.
other This place really made a terrible situation as easy as possible.  Our cat was hit by a car or beaten, and my husband found her immobile and crying horribly in pain.  We rushed her to the clinic, and the doctor saw her right away.  She told us our options, but was very upfront about the liklihood that our kitty would pass no matter what we did.  She didn't pressure us one way or another, and left the room so that we could talk privately and make our decision.  My husband asked if they could give her some pain meds while we talked about it, and they gave her some immediately.Once we made our difficult decision to put our kitty down, she brought the cat into a private room with us so that we could say goodbye.  She left us alone and gave us as much time as we needed.  She also let us be present in the room when they gave her the final shot.  At all times the doctor and the techs were compassionate and very respectful.  I was crying and they were very sensitive to my feelings.  They treated my little kitty so gently even after she had passed.  They even sent a sympathy card to our house a few days later.  I really appreciated how they helped us through this difficult time, and I would definitely reccommend them if anyone else is in a similar situation.
other When cowboys ride off into the sunset, they probably stop at Greasewood Flat for a burger and beer. This rustic little bar is located a bit outside the city right near Pinnacle Peak and is definitely worth the drive! You'll know you are in the right spot when you see the antique farm equipment and suddenly feel like you are walking up to an Old West saloon. Say hello to the mule on your way in. Outside they have picnic tables, horseshoes, and fire pits (gets chilly out there in the desert!), and on the weekends they have live music and dancing. Inside, the bar is pretty small, and the place is covered in dollar bills and business cards left by satisfied cowboys and cowgals. For the nights without live music, don't you fret, they have a jukebox with tons of country hits. The night we went it was the bartender's birthday, and the regulars were definitely having a good time.  Both a historic landmark (120+-year old original stagecoach stop) and a dive bar, Greasewood Flat is clearly special to Arizona, and is a definite must see. I'll be going back on a weekend to get the true Greasewood Flat experience and hopefully see a cute cowboy or two..
3 The fitness part of this place is great: machines are new and plentiful.  Good classes on the schedule, and plenty of cold water and fresh towels.Now, the spa, on the other hand, is mediocre at best.  The pool is a bit of a walk and available to anyone at the hotel; same with the jacuzzi, which also means the jacuzzi is outside!  Why no jacuzzi inside?  The steam room is small and there is no sauna.  There are only 3 shower stalls, with shampoo and shower gel, but no conditioner. The lounge area is also small and not at all relaxing.  And the robes are super thin (with a chilly room; that's not even nice!) and not very big.  I had to sit very carefully so as to not expose myself to everyone. Hello! haha.The massage itself was very nice, but the spa is not relaxing, especially for the prices.  I wouldn't return to the spa, although the gym is good.
3 As the prior reviewer states I too drove by this place a million times. My husband and I love breakfast and are always seeking the ultimate omelet . We both ordered (of course) an omelet. Mine was chorizo, cheese and green chilies and my husband's was cheese and mushroom. I must say the food was piping hot, which is always a plus for me, I like my food hot! The omelet was pretty darn good, and the hashbrowns were nice and crisp. Not my ultimate omelet but I would definitely go again.
other Eat, drink, be merry.Love the atmosphere. Love the upholstered loveseats, love the bruschetta and salad. Love the open air.Don't love the horrid parking options. Don't love when I'm seated on the wooden chairs. How can we be expected to relax and drink up when our bums are bruising?Servers? Easy on the eyes. Nice bonus for girls' night out.
other Scale of 1-10 (multiple visits):10 Food9 Service10 Atmosphere8 Value
other I liked the concept. Staff was very nice. Food tasted like it was warmed up in a microwave and cold on top and warm on the bottom. After we watched our  movie we wanted to purchase tickets a week in advance for another movie. We went to customer service and asked them if they knew if TinTin would be playing on Weds. (we were there Saturday night). They told us they did not know and we would have to check on Weds. Whaaat? They don't know what movies are playing the following week? I was ticked off... their website is no better. It is confusing and hard to order tickets. I searched for tickets for tomorrow and it says showtimes not available. Sure seems like they don't want anybody to come see any movies. After spending $100 for food and movie I think I will try a different place.
other Amazing. Romantic!
other I found this place on Yelp, and went there for the lunch buffet. Having read the reviews, I had really high expectations of the place, but was sorely disappointed. Watery sambar and rasam, hard idlis, dosas with a miserly amount of potato stuffing, gulab jamuns that tasted nothing like gulab jamuns, inattentive and too few waiters, and disgustingly dirty bathrooms---in my opinion, Udupi Cafe missed the mark completely. Their a la carte menu items might be better, but I am not going back to find out!
other Unfortunately, my birthday always falls right around Mother's Day.  Which means that every time I want to go out to eat for my birthday it is packed.  We thought we'd celebrate early by going on Saturday, but it was still packed.  We called ahead and the earliest reservation was 9 PM, but the person on the phone said that if we just came down, they would fit us in.So we sat at the bar for maybe 20 minutes (IN YOUR FACE CHAIN RESTAURANTS!!!) and our beers came with a small appetizer of cheese and salami.  These people think of everything. And the wait staff is pretty damn attentive.  The hostess heard me say something about my birthday, which was passed on to the waitress so my super huge and yummy meal ended with a delicious dessert of my choosing.  The bread and relish tray would have been more than enough of an appetizer for me, but my partners in crime also wanted the spinach artichoke dip, which was soooo tasty.  My steak was SOFT but cooked exactly how I like it.  These are true professionals.  Asparagus was cooked perfectly.  The chicken pot pie soup was exactly what I expected and so yummy.  And the dessert?  Triple creme brulee - kahlua which tasted like a caucasian, chocolate which managed to be super chocolately but not too rich, and a mixed berry that would have been fabulous if I was a normal rasberry eating human.Yes, it's a little pricey, but you easily get other meals if not more out of one dish.  Especially with the yummy bread and relish tray that is also presented before the meal.  The atmosphere is cozy and a little crowded.  If you are wierd about personal space, this is probably not the place to go.Overall: I love this place and go every time I get the opportunity.
other Doesn't get better than this, the guys at the Chandler Mall location do it right, every time!
other Vaguely remembered this place from Yelp when we were looking for a lunch spot after a visit to the Acxupuncturist up the street. We pulled into the lot and by the looks of the outside, there was a bit hesitancy to go in. So, thank you to my friend's smartphone for allowing us to read the yelp reviews and allow us to take a chance on this place. I am happy to say our first visit was a good one. Everyone has said already, it is homey and maybe a bit dated in its decor. However, I don't care for ambiance and classy settings, I care about decent food and friendly service.MMR has both. I had the Hot Turkey lunch special for Thursdays and I have to say  it was huge for a lunch plate and the price was so reasonable. Maybe I am old school, but when you bring me hot bread and butter right after I order, you have already won me over. Then the Turkey Plate came and it was really good, moist and flavorful. The potatoes are not mashed, they are smashed-there are actually potato chunks in there. I was not thrilled with the stuffing because IMO it had too much sage (to the point of overpowering) in it and that was distracting me from what otherwise would have been a very good stuffing. There was also  MORE  BREAD given to me with my meal in the form of a roll. That was good because I needed it to dip in the copious amounts of gravy on the plate. Mia was our server and she was really great. Very attentive, helpful and actually seemed to enjoy serving us. Rare these days. This staff has it together.  We were stuffed and decided to opt-out on dessert and take an APPLE  pie to-go. The pie was still warm when she brought us the box and it traveled well for 3 hours all the way to Marana. My friends boyfriend is  the pie lover and he had two slices after dinner that night and I can say we all loved it. I ate a slice for breakfast the next day. Excellent, excellent  pie. Our two lunches, two beverages and a pie to go was $35, considering the pie was about 1/3 of that, not bad at all. We go to the acupuncturist this Tuesday and I plan on getting more yumminess from MMR.
other Monday... BIG screen football, volume up, don't come here Mon night if you don't want to be immersed in football. $other burgers that are reg $10, combined that with happy hour deals 4-7 pm every day of delicious GOOD drafts for just a bit over $3 & all flatbreads & apps 1/other price. At normal prices I would feel more 3-star. But if you know what you are getting into & come for deals, it is great for what it is.Waiter was VERY knowledgeable of menu, helpful with suggestions.  Atmosphere really is great with the dark wood ceilings to floors, big place but broken up with all sorts of nooks, interesting apothecary stuff Apollo over in cabinets, with Seattle Seahawks stuff thrown in.
other Loved the winkie!  Eat your vegan meal next door at Green and stroll over to Nami for dessert.
other Let me first explain that we came to the place on a bad night...  Apparently, one of their regulars LITERALLY drank herself to death - spent a week in the hospital before whe finally died.  Instead of a funeral, her husband and family set up a memorial at her favorite bar...  The place was filled with long hugs and sobbing... all while the gal's husband was hammered and wobbled leaning on the end of the bar.  Sad, sad, sad, sad...... on SO many levels.........That said, we just tried to stay away from it all... and our server (Bobbi - hope I spelled it right) was really great in keeping happy, warm, and chatty.Ignoring the other patrons that night, then, this place is definitely a great little legit Irish pub (apparently the oldest in the Valley for you history nerds)!Firstly, they have all sorts of Irish food items (cottage pie, corned beef and cabbage, bangers and mash, beef stew, seafood, and they even have a boxty).  We tried a couple different things that were all tasty!Next, almost all of their beer taps are dedicates to Irish or UK beers (Guinness, Smithwick's, Harp, Kilkenny, Magner's, Newcastle, etc...)... and they know how to pour a stout!They didn't have live music that night (apparently, they normally have live Irish bands 6 nights a week)... but they played a great array of REAL Irish music the whole time!I read a couple reviews that claimed it's not an authentic Irish pub...... but I'm guessing these folks haven't spent a whole lot of time in Ireland?  Understand that ANY bar, in America, has to have cheeseburgers and chicken fingers - because you're not IN Ireland...  That said...... if a bar plays Irish music... has 7 of 10 taps dedicated to Irish and UK beers (with the other 3 Irish or UK STYLE like Killians, Kiltlifter, and Sam Adams)... has all SORTS of Irish food on the menu... real Irish signage (not shamrocks)... proper stout pours in two-parts... plays Irish sports on TV... supports the local Irish clubs..... what makes it NOT a legit Irish Pub?This place is about as legit Irish as you'll find in Arizona... and worth a visit!
3 Typical Taco Bell with typical Taco Bell menu (other than the Popeye's Fish they serve from the same kitchen/counter). Not sure if some of the people in the kitchen could speak English. One employee on break sat in front of a small TV in the seating area which was VERY LOUD and ANNOYING. Every table was dirty despite it not being very busy, and the bottles of condiments at the "fixin's" bar were filthy. Can't beat the prices, though. As usual, I left "stuft" on two bucks.
other Update: As of Feb 2010 this place closed because the owners got in a bitch fight.I live right next door to this place at Shade.  I go often enough, great happy hour.  Prices are pretty cheap ($5ish for the various happy hour sushi rolls), service is pretty fast, and it's great that it's locally owned and not a chain restaurant.  Only "negative" comment is it' is a bit small inside, hard to accommodate large groups of more than 8, and even that is pushing it if they are busy.  If you can go before everyone gets off work, it's pretty quiet in there, and fun to sit at the sushi bar as well.
other This company is Awesome!!! I was recommended to go here by a friend and was hesitant since it was my first time going to a salon. I was extremely impressed with how welcoming they are and how dedicated they are to making your experience unforgettable. They gave me a facial massage treatment thing that was out of this world. The entire day I walked around with my face forward and could not stop talking about how great I felt. I will be visiting quite often. Thank you so much!John Paul D.
other This place is awful.  I bring my fourteen year old daughter along for services once in awhile, and on two occasions here they managed to seat me and skip her for other clients that did not have appointments.  They wont accept a tip from your debit/credit card which is pretty inconvenient if you don't carry cash.  They use a cheap base coat in an unmarked bottle that leaves my polish job looking funky. My mother was a loyal client until she got an infection in her toe after a visit.  I don't like to write bad reviews but this place does not deserve your business.
other Let me be clear on one thing: I love this place. The DJ's they have make it a lot of fun and the movie selections are great. In addition, their beer and wine selections are quite tasty. So, why not other stars? I think that the crowd just has to pick up, really. I know they're currently working on adding new menu items and movie selections to the place, but right now, it can just be dead. I went in there most recently last Friday. There was literally only one other group of people there. And I use the term "group of people" loosely, considering it was a group of two. We ended up leaving, because I can spend time with just my group of friends at my house if I wanted to and we were looking more to have an outing. However, I wanted the FilmBar atmosphere and experience that I certainly get on Saturday nights and it just was not there on Friday. DO go on Saturday nights. DJentrification is great and the vibe is wonderful. BUT...more importantly...go on other days!!! This place needs to fill up. Go see a movie, the theater is great! Get some drinks for happy hour. Go on Friday night and Sunday night! It's a nice bar that really has more of a hip lounge kind of feel. And the great part is that they're improving every day. I think they're only about a year old and it sometimes takes time. But the staff is great, the drinks are perfectly chosen, and the music is generally pretty amazing.
other A hipster shindig- for day and night- make your meal with THE Burger au Poivre, Cobb Salad and best made cocktails around... One of the best places for brunch!
other OK: call me 'weird' here: but; I liked the funky (very) Old School ambiance of MacAlpines when my fiance and I went there this past Sunday for the Studebaker and friends car show.Admittedly; I was there once before ca. 1999 and was NOT impressed but things have def improved IMHO.I had a Club sandwich and it was one of the best ones I've ever had, at least in recent years. Would eat one again. The chocolate milk shake was OK but could have used a tad more syrup but, I'd have one again.
other I have to admit the quality of food here is better than your average berto's restaurant, However the girl who works the drive-through during the late shift makes some of the strangest mistakes with the food. Warning if your ordering other items don't be surprised to find them in one box combined into some strange hybrid. I honestly don't think she understands the word "And". This has happened to me several times int the last month. Always make sure to check your order here.
3 Jack in the Box, this one in particular, is busiest from 10pm-2am. It definitely a "better when your drunk" kind of place, or at least I think it is from the number of drunk patrons I see eating there. The food? Well, it's JitB, what do you expect? You got the 99 cent for other tacos deal, which is a must add for any meal. You also have breakfast served all day. This means you can get a Extreme Sausage Sandwhich, other Tacos, and a Chicken Fajita Pita in the same meal. That's some good eatin'. Please note that nothing about the Chicken Fajita Pita is remotely close to an actual fajita. This location specializes in making your food NOT look like it does in the picture. The picture may show a big fluffy bun with a juicy burger, however your burger will probably look like someone stepped on it then ran it over with their car. It doesn't change the taste, tho. Still tastes exactly like you would expect something to taste from JitB. I mean, it's good food and a good value. By "good" food, I of course mean greasy and unhealthy. That is the definition of good food though, right?
other Worst customer service of any grocery store I've ever been in.  EVER!  I'd rather go to any other Safeway or any other grocery store.  I'll drive the extra 10 miles just to avoid this place.
other oh man, I gained other pounds on Sunday but since it was from Joe's I don't even really care - it was that good. I won't go into the local ingredients, Agritopia, etc since others already have but it is a wonderful thing. More below.The food was awesome. Very fresh, delicious and wholesome - you actually felt like you were eating food that was also good for you. Granted we just had the burgers and ice cream but there's a whole menu there to explore on future visits. I loved the signature burger with pesto & fontina, neither of which I had ever thought of but worked very well. The onion rings were good, as were the milkshakes and sundae. It really fills you up fast though, so try to pace yourself!I was equally enchanted with the setting. Beautiful place. Just like a farm oasis in the midst of suburbia - I hope it doesn't vanish in the midst of the houses all around it. Even the bathroom was noteworthy - clean, black and white with dolls and a closed circuit tv. It reminded me of the Jetsons - you know, the 60s idea of space age. Sitting outside wasn't too hot, as it's the one place I've seen so far where the misters really work and don't just spray you and puddle down.  The only down side was when I asked where the farm stand was and the cashier pointed it out, but without mentioning it was closed. Nor was there a sign at the actual location indicating when it would be open in the fall.Oh, and what was really nice was the sense of everyone relaxing - just kicking back and having a good time. definitely worth going to again, and again ...
other 5/7/12...I have to make a correction to my review as I received communication from someone with the club.. I was informed that they are not like other clubs as they have a "Two Item" minimum, not a two drink minimum.   So you can order a food dish and a drink to meet that minimum.  And I did confirm that one in our group ordered a bottled water which counted toward his minimum.So I stand corrected.
3 I was on my way into Sweet Republic just before Christmas when I spotted Painted Pretzel a few doors down.  Since I love pretzels, I was imagining all sorts of delights.  Hard pretzels in knots, twists, and rods covered with the finest chocolate.  Freshly baked soft pretzels salted, or rolled in cinnamon and sugar, or butter and garlic.  You name it.  They were going to sell it.Well I was sorely disappointed.  Upon entering, I realized this is probably more of a mail order type business.  No soft pretzels, either.  They specialize in pretzels dipped in chocolate and topped with nuts, candy pieces, etc.  There were some boxes of pretzels already made up, and we purchased a few.  The honey wheat pretzel rods were actually pretty good, the small bite-sized pretzels were nothing special.  The chocolate was a nice quality, but not the best.  Although they hand dip all the pretzels, they do not make the actual pretzels.  So if you're on a local foods kick, which I'm not, this isn't the place for you.  Not bad to have around the house and for gifts to pretzel lovers or corporate gifts as they are better than the products you would find in most grocery stores.  I was just hoping for a little more.
other I love this Starbucks. We all know every Starbucks is expensive, so forget that. But these people have our drinks memorized, if you go there alot anyways, they're on top. Good Starbucks.
other This place is great.  They have the best veggie burger - yes veggie burger - that I have probably ever had.  It is spinach based and has chopped jalapenos in it for some kick.  When I buy an entree, my kid eats for free.  So not only is the food good but it's very fairly priced as well.  And much better than the regular Big Fat Greek Restaurants around town.
other My croissant with ham, eggs & swiss this morning was fabulous & came with a bonus brownie (saved for later & was very yummy too!) & orange juicePlease try the iced tea!! The way the owner makes it is amazing & like nothing I've tried!  He mixes a kind of apple cider that they make on-site with fresh mint.Everything is made from scratch!  I love this and do not mind to wait a couple of minutes for beautifully personally made for me food!Even hummus is made from scratch from dried chickpeas.I was very pleased & my belly was full!
other I love the Lost Leaf for not ony becuase it's cool and hip, but because I am always made to feel welcome and relaxed - as I am not that cool or hip.  The crowd varies, but I like to go on Sunday night and listen to Jazz.  They have had some great bands there and I like how they prefer the local talent - the artists, the musicians, and the bevies.There is no food, which is really sad.  I wish they had packaged food to nosh on, or took the approach that SideBar did wtih the package nosh (hummus and chips, etc.) Too bad.
other Just went back here and had another fabulous meal - everything was so delicious and clearly homemade with care. Wonderful!
other Double-dog dare you to ask for a side of ranch.You won't find a fryer in the house either. But what you will find is that every dish is under 47other calories - & every dish, delish!  Well, I'm generalizing because we DID only have two dishes, but if the chefs can make a salad taste THAT good, why, what will they be able to do with meat!? I'll find out sooner than later. We'd only stopped in for a mid-afternoon snack on a Wednesday - the decor reminds me a bit of "Frank & Albert's" - warm, clean lines and inviting. Our service was spot-on. Everyone was professional and friendly. Many yummy dishes on the menu - I wished I was hungrier! (The menu changes weekly, so I didn't get too attached to any one item!)  Mini, adorable desserts were tempting-looking and only $2.50 each. Seasons 5other also has an extensive wine list and a roomy bar area. There's even a piano behind the bar; I did not see a tv in the house. Let's see: No tv, no ranch. no fryer. Tasty low calories at reasonable prices, with great service in an upscale cozy setting. The place even made me abandon my "butter mantra" for a couple of hours. The reinvention of dining out!?
other I've been looking for a decent prime rib in the area for years with no luck. That's all changed now. I found Lafitte's on Yelp, and was surprised - I had no idea it existed. I'm glad I came though. The prime rib was easily the best prime rib I've had in this part of town, and may be the best prime rib I've had in the under $20 price range in years.  The place seems relatively unknown - it's hidden in the Embassy Suites Hotel. So on a Saturday night it was pretty slow - hardly anyone there. That's really a shame.  The food was very good. It started with the salad. It seemed fresh - it didn't look or feel like it came from a bag. The greens weren't overly cold or wet, and it was arranged nicely on the plate. The bread was a simple sourdough.   We ordered the petite cut, and when our waitress brought out the plate, I was a bit shocked. It was much larger than everyone else's large cut. I could barely eat it - that's saying something. I had the creaole jambalaya as a side. It was tasty with some spice. The sausage was tasty. The vegetables were ok - a mix of squash, colored onions, etc.  The waitress was friendly and courteous, and never let our drinks get empty. The nest part was that two of us ate for less than $35. I'll be back!
3 Their food isn't bad, it's pretty hard to mess up gyros, rice, salad, and fries.  When it comes to this type of food it really comes down to preference.  For me, I didn't care for this place.  I like crispy fries, their fries are soggy.  I like Beef & Lamb gyros, theirs are Beef only.  I like a mixed green salad with light onion, they serve a shredded romaine salad with heavy onion.  Their prices are fair, portions large, and service friendly, it's just not for me.  They did have a lot of sandwiches and burgers that looked good, if that's your thing.
other This place is great! The pizza is so yummy, thick chewy crust and good sauce makes it one of my go to places for pie. The wings are fantastic with a diverse amount of different sauces to choose, from the classic mild, medium, and hot to BBQ, honey hot and my favorite sweet baby rays sweet chili.The interior of the restaurant is large and nicely decorated with lots of wood trim and there is a kids play area and TV's to watch sports and such. Sit outside in the patio or take it to go.
other Good food, great atmosphere, great service and great prices! We will definitely be back! Can't wait to try the Sunday Brunch!
other Been there twice now.  Great servers and the owner is a sweetheart.  I ate the Pechuga Asada and a pupusa Locoye(sp?) this time.  The chicken was made right, great beans and rice, fresh avocado,  big portions and the salsa and chips are excellent.   I live two blocks from here and I need to wake the eff up and go here more.
3 The food here is good. It's not outstanding, or anything to write home about, but it IS tasty.  The whole making a tortilla in front of your eyes seems a little kitch-y to me, but so what? Everyone has to have a marketing ploy.I've eaten in, and taken out, and the burrito quality is about the same.  Personally, I like Chipotle better, as I like the dressing on their veggie salad.My one beef (amusing, since I only get the beans) is that they were a little too light handed with everything. I got hardly any guacamole or sour cream, and that is really what helps to make a delicious tasty burrito of goodness in my eyes.Will I go back? Certainly, if it's on my way and I'm hungry. Will I choose to seek it out? Probably not.
other Hubby and I have lived less than other miles from this place for over 20 years and never stopped in.  Looking for good Chinese so yelped the area and Dragon Palace popped up with good reviews.  Comments about the outside are right - little corner spot in dated strip mall but who cares if the food is good....and it was!  We ordered three lunches to try out different dishes.  Both of us loved the egg rolls along with the sweet n sour chicken and the house chicken.  Not as thrilled with the beef and brocolli - nothing special on that dish so will stick with the chicken next time....and there will be a next time!  Don't be fooled by the outside - step in and try the food - you'll be back.
other I understand I'm not dude and so I'm not there to state at your "twin peaks" however, that being said I am there to buy a beer and when it takes the bartender 20 minutes just to get a beer I'm over it. So I was never gonna come back but was forced with a group of friends who wanted to eat and was just as upset as the first time. Fries were soggy and our server disappeared. We all decided were not going back. Just because your a good looking server doesn't give you an excuse for sucking.
other Holy AMAZING.  I went here this past Saturday for a baby shower in one of the private dining rooms and was absolutely blown away by the food.  We had a spread which included Mac & Cheese, Sliders, Chopped Salad, some bread and french fries.  I'm still thinking about those sliders and the french fries.  I can't WAIT to go back and order from the full menu. As is par for the Sam Fox course; the decor is over the top.  I need to find out who designs these places and have them make over my house!
3 I have been here for breakfast twice.  Both times the food was very good (love the biscuits and gravy!).  It is a bit of an older building and everything looks a bit run down.  Service has not been phenomenal.    Last time we arrived the host person had just left to seat the couple that walked in before us.  The manager and FOUR additional servers were standing at the cash register chatting.  As the entry way is small..I could hear their conversation.  It was just chit chat...not a meeting, nothing important....but apparently not one of them could see fit to either acknowledge our existence or walk us to one of the many open tables.  After a few minutes the host came back and took us to our table.  I assumed the manager just felt that taking a group to their table (or asking one of the wait staff to do it) was beneath her.  But then as soon as we were taken away, she promptly seated the family that walked in behind us.  Grrrrr...  I enjoy the food, the portions are large.  The food is very heavy comfort food.  Service is so-so and the manager does not seem to care about her customers.   If not for the service I would give them a 4.
3 I've been here a grand total of three times, and I probably won't be returning any time soon.  It's not that the food is flat out bad, per se, it's just that there are many better options nearby. The first time I went on a recommendation, and the food was... OK. The 2nd time I went the food was still only... OK. The third time... well, you get the picture.The first obvious knock against Rosita's Place is the chips and salsa. They're not bad, but they're not complimentary. Given all the competition which offer free chips and salsa, you'd think these would have to be pretty darn special, but they're not. Good, but not outstanding.Secondly, the rice and beans are just OK (that descriptor keeps coming up in this review). The chicken enchiladas were fresh, but lacked any real flavor or spice. The machaca, which is supposed to be  one of their specialties, was soggy... a BIG no-no for a dish that is a specialty in this region.So, honestly, while I wouldn't discourage anyone from going here, I'm not sure what some of the hype is about, especially when Rito's, Tacos De Juarez, and Comedor Guadalajara aren't that far away.
other I was really excited about this event, maybe my expectations were too high, because I was really underwhelmed.  Very little shade, ran out of water, by the time I got there at 1pm (other obligations) 20% of the vendors were out of food, and by the time I ate my way through some, everyone else was already out.   60 bucks for that?  I don't think so.  And when I mentioned it to "the person in charge", he was patronizing, invalidating and kept telling me how happy the chefs were.  Well, I'm your consumer, big guy.  Sorry, Devoured, wish it could have been better. What food I did try, was pretty good.
3 Stadium was REALLY nice... the MORONS in control of the parking...not so much.  I understand that you're not going to get doctors/lawyers/rocket scientists to control parking and move traffic in and out of the game.  HOWEVER, it would be nice if Glendale would pull their heads out of their butts and build a new on/off ramp for the stadium.  It took over 30mins to get out of the parking lot!!  To make it worse..the Cards lost :(
other The Culinary Dropout , you get the best of both worlds. The food is off the hook (it's great) ,the service, these ladie's and guy's take care of your every need, and as a added bonus you have some of the best performers in Phoenix, entertaining you while you dinne.....Check it out....Bluesman Mike
3 Ok, so this is a Sprouts now. Boring.The layout of the store is pretty much the same as when it was Sunflower. I would like this Sprouts more, if it was like an actual Sprouts. Instead it's just a weird transitiony in between "Sproutsflower". That's what I'm calling it, until they figure it out. Atleast they still have the soup bar.
other The BEST SPORTS BAR in chandler hands down!! A great place to meet friends and even bring the kids!! The owners are always around to ensure ur experience!! TV's everywhere, if you love sports and beer this is the place for you!! The nob has events all week and food specials to go along... the ribs are amazing!! however the GYRO is good as it gets!! The best gyro in the valley you can write that one down!! and the wings... once you pop u just cant stop!!HOB NOB SPORTS BAR & GRILL cheers to you!!
other Oz is a great local bar and a nice change from the bumping Charlie's (which, don't get me wrong, is still a good bar). Booker, the bartender, is the coolest and will bring you any of the toys on the back counter, so long as he has time. The cheap prices, awesome juke box (sorry Korina, we were probably the ones playing all the Madonna) and a chance of spotting Stephanie Ann--the most fabulous drag queen around who really knows her vodka--are but a few of the reasons why I  love this place. It's also walking distance from my BFF's house.
other This is a fun POOL party club in Scottsdale next to everyone's favorite, American Junkie. I have never eaten here, other than a dessert that I don't remember. ;) It can also be a fun place for after dinner drinks or dance. The ambiance of relaxing and drinking next to a pool always brings about a good time. The music is LOUD and the bartenders are nice. Their bathrooms are clean and pretty. Spanish Fly rages during the daytime summer weekends, and is a great place to hang out when you still want to enjoy the outdoors and it's blazing hot outside. I will be going back - glad to have you in Scottsdale, Spanish Fly.
other Love the atmosphere, the patios, drinks and especially the chicken lollipops.  If you haven't tried them, they are buffalo wings with a handy bone to hold on to while you eat.  The sauce with blue cheese dressy is one for the record books!I am also a fan that they serve breakfast 7 days a week and have free wifi.  This is a great place to meet for work or meet after a game.  Not too stuffy, but nice enough that it isn't just labeled a bar.
other Great BBQ, although not a huge fan of the cafeteria style ordering. I have been twice, I got the brisket sandwich one time and ribs the next. Both were delicious. I added  bbq sauce to the ribs because I thought they needed it. Try the homemade root beer at least once, too. YUM. We got there just in time ( a bit before 6 on a Friday night)  as we were leaving the line was 3x as long...out the door and around the corner.  Oh FYI...for sides I got the beans (loved them) and my kids said the macaroni and cheese was good. Dad wasn't impressed with the coleslaw.
other Great China   chinese restaurant and super buffet there is no the in the name.But there is some good food inside the place.the decor is average and are booth was comfy but well worn.The buffet had about 80 items ,about the super buffet requirement.They had a small sushi section and the sushi was very tasty.The wonton soup i had was very hot and good it had most of your typical trays with a couple of different twists on some like the stuffed clams were huge and and they had some good sole,that thet called snow fish?When i left this place i was stuffed and everything i ate was good.So yes Great China gets other stars.And for Norm R. they got the almond cookie packages
other I got a BBQ chicken sandwich and all the bones came complementary! SICK!  I almost broke my teeth when I bit into it.  The service was even worse, the manager (I think) stood in the way of me ordering while he was talking on the phone about football for about 10 min.GROSS!
3 This is the "other" Coffee Plantation that I always forget about even though it is right by where I grew up. Weird, huh?Actually, it isn't weird. Because this Coffee Plantation blends into its stripmall surroundings so seamlessly that you totally forget it's there. They take absolutely  no chance with decor or ambiance. For all you know, it's part of the laundromat next door. Coffee isn't bad and it never seems to be too busy so it's actually an undercover great spot to get some things done without worry of distraction. Not sure of the wifi situation, but a good book on a rainy afternoon and this place would suit you well.
other Very clean with and old fashion cinema atmosphere. Snacks are very expensive so if popcorn and soda are a must for you, expect to spend alot of money. The amazing reclining seats are worth it though. I definitly recomend Cinemark 16 as the place to go to watch movies!    Also there are alot of great eating places next to it or within walking distance to do the dinner  and movie date night!
other Every once in a while, you just need to enjoy good southern cooking.I was taken to Lo-lo's while visiting Phoenix.The Sweet Tea is served in a mason jar and comes with a diabetic attack. I had the Betty Bop - fried chicken breast and waffle. The waffle was really the stand out portion of the meal, but the two did work together.You don't have to get the chicken and waffle combo. But come on, don't be like that.We went Friday before lunch, and we were sitting and eating in 10 minutes, but from the looks of the other reviews, that isn't normal.
other It's cute. It's homey. However...You close at 6pm on a Wednesday night +You were going to charge me 50 cents to process my debit card=I left with one drink and won't be backToo bad too since my best friend lives around the corner. We would have lived here ...
other I recently picked up a few satin flower arrangements for a fund raiser event. In spite of having bought a 'coupon deal' for the store, the owner Rachel was more than willing to give me the best possible pricing and pieces. The arrangements were beautiful and she even custom made a couple of them for us. The colors and flowers she uses are very well picked and beautifully arranged. I highly recommend Flora Unique.
other Went here while on vacation in Phoneix based on seeing it on Man vs Food. Could not have been more impressed. Food was amazing. Far above expectations.  The torta was huge and delicious. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic authentic meal at a good price!
other "I don't know who invented the high heel, but all men owe him a lot."  (Marilyn Monroe)A girl and her shoes...are a beautiful thing.  From bags to boots to tennis shoes to pumps to sandals, the selection (at least today) was EXCELLENT.  Not only were there a variety of brands but a variety of price points too.  This place had me salivating!  I could easily have purchased three (3) pair but decided to wait and visit again with a friend......it's a chick thing!
other ok, so really. how can you go wrong with burgers? i guess it's a just little absurd to me that people dress up to eat a burger. or that people choose to drink a glass of pricey wine instead of say, a root beer float with their burger. speaking of which, their rootbeer float is too pricey for what you get....at any rate, i took my brother to eat here once upon a time, for kicks and giggles. see what all the hype is about. we were actually seated really quickly on a busy night, and quickly ordered our burgers. they were good. that goes without saying. and i really enjoyed the decor and the fries in the mini shopping cart! yes, something so ridiculous it is adorable. i don't really like having to order fries separate, because i think they should just come with your burger, but i digress. the burgers were juicy, came out fast and piping hot, cooked to our specifications, and surprisingly, not too much more expensive than my childhood fave, red robbins. ok fine, at least their fries had yummalicious dipping sauces.i'd go again, just not on a busy night. and maybe i'd dress up a little more. but then i'd feel crazy - like, why am i wearing a dress to eat a burger? but i do like those fancy-schmancy burgers... i guess i can suck it up.
other Man oh man... I can't decide whether I want to review this place or not under the auspices of "if you don't have anything nice to say..."All I have to say is this: We ordered food. It came totally wrong. I asked for a vegan salad, not specifically, but that's how I ordered it, and it came with chicken and cheese. This just shows a complete inability to read the order. People make adjustments all the time. I have worked at a restaurant. I have fucked up. I should have been lashed 40 times! Read what people order! So when I got the wrong salad and saw what an unbelievable disappointment it was going to be, I ordered a veggie sandwich instead, which, to their credit, they delivered and took off the bill. The best customer service in the world could not overcome this sandwich. It was a monumental fucking embarrassment. I cannot believe they let that thing out the door. I ate it because I was starving but I would have liked to have driven it back there and go through it, ingredient by ingredient, with the preparer... Explain to me how this is appealing to the eyes, mouth, stomach, etc.I just hated it. A lot. Sorry, I'm sure you're nice people with good intentions.
other I grew up on Empanadas in Panama and I have been hard pressed to find anything close to them in the U.S.. today I found them! A perfectly crunchy crust and the beef was beautifully spiced. Usually Empanadas are bland and soggy. They did a great job on these.I usually don't like rice, but the rice and black beans were wonderful. Service was great! I'll be back!
other "The office space, layout, presentation gets other stars, the customer service you receive from the employees at Corporate Office Center is a negative 10. They will scare your clients off, scare your own staff and make your life a living hell. Their office locations and space is beautiful but if a say, a client shows up at a time other than their scheduled time, they will be told to leave.

other Amazing cheesesteak.One mile from my home is Corleone's. About 15-20 minutes from my home is Capriotti's. I never go to Corleone's. I go to Capriotti's all the time.The workers here are nice and the cheesesteak is terrific. The large is 20" I believe, so if you're ordering for yourself and in no mood to eat until you have a stroke, get the medium. Also, try it with the hot peppers. It adds the slightest bit of spice without becoming too overwhelming.That's really all I can say about this place. Wonderful cheesesteak. I haven't tried anything else because the cheesesteak is too good to pass up when I make the drive down there. The patrons rave about the other sandwiches, though, so I absolutely would not be afraid to try something else. There's maybe other or 6 tables inside and other outside? so be prepared to order to go if you arrive at prime dine-in lunch/dinner hours.Do yourself a favor and go to Capriotti's. Help this place attain the reviews and ratings it deserves. The fact that there's only 8 reviews is criminal. I understand it is in the heart of the suburbs, but it's worth the drive.
other This is my go to place when I want a cheap quick meal without having to get fast food. They have healthy options and use fresh flavorful ingredients. Their portion sizes are generous and the staff is always nice and friendly. My favorite is the greek salad w/gryo meat, the dressing is awesome! I'm also a fan of the platters and spanakopita.
other While Calabria Italian Kitchen & Deli is at this location the Grocery portion has been CLOSED.
3 My husband and I tried this place out since it is fairly close to our house and gets decent reviews.  I drank, my husband ate.  The wine selection is ok and the staff seemed friendly.  My husband's dinner was okay.  I'd probably give this place better reviews had they not attempted to give themselves a $1other bump on their tip.  I'd also probably give them better reviews if the manager would have called me back after leaving a message with a staff member about the charge especially when I left all the details necessary to fix the issue and was promised a call back that afternoon when the manager arrived.  Now, I can only assume it was not an inadvertent mistake since they give me no reason to believe otherwise.  I really would rather not have to keep calling back and chase my $$ down.Edited review - took them from other star to 3 stars since I received a phone call today from a manager and was advised it was a mistake and they credited me back the funds.  Also will be sending me a gift card for the trouble.  Overall, I appreciate the follow up and their efforts to fix the issue and bring me back in.  I was routing for them since the patio seems like a pretty chill place to have some drinks and unwind.
other T. Cook's continues to be my go-to spot... with or without my fiance.  It's like my home away from home.  I feel comfortable going in for a drink or a bite to eat any night of the week.  Let me be clear about one thing, however - I always sit at the bar!In addition to the regular menu items, the burger at T. Cooks is consistently amazing. This sizable delight is carnivore candy for the soul. Ten ounces of tenderloin burger with white cheddar cheese, bacon and Guiness tempura onion rings on a ciabatta bun with a grain mustard aioli. My mouth is watering just thinking about it right now.Anyone up for a burger?
other Yes, I'm a fan this place but it definitely does not deserve a other star rating.  First off lets start with the decor.  While it was very nice when it first opened it's now getting a little raggedy looking and could use some updating.  Food wise this buffet is above average and definitely worth a visit.   If I could give them some advice it would be to get rid of  the HUGE salad buffet section or at least scale it way down and put that money into even more entree selections.  I've been coming here ever since they opened and hardly ever see anyone eating off the salad section.  So why spend so much money to have such a huge selection???   Put that money into the entree selection and make this place an even better value.  And for Gods sake bring back the Mayonnaise Shrimp !!  You made one of the best versions I've ever tasted.
other Great food, great price, very awesome lunch specials.  I would have given other stars but the service is normally a bit fast and some of the wait staff are a bit pushy!!  All in all, great value.
other Great food!!!  Everything on the menu is good.  The bacon guacamole burger is next to perfection.
other Husband and I have been trying to go to Urban Cookies for a while now. For one reason or another we kept missing its store hours. We finally made it today, and boy, were we glad. I had a vanilla cupcake and he had the urban cookie, which has chocolate chips and walnuts. The cookie was the perfect balance of moist and crispy. The guy behind the counter told us that the vanilla cupcakes was a special, but when they rotated it out people yelled at them. After taking one bite, I totally understood why. The cupcake is the best I've ever had. The vanilla frosting is not too sweet, perfectly creamy and melts in your mouth. I just hope they get more business so they can expand their hours!
other I can overcome the hipster sneer and accept that I am an uncool blemish in a world full of cut-off corduroys and patterned leggings. What I cannot and will not get over is an unapologetic staff whose epic error led to me breaking other years of meatless eating because of an order mishap.I ordered the red pepper tomato quiche. After 20 minutes waiting for the quiche to warm in what appeared to be a 200 degree oven, I double checked to make sure my name was on the plate at the counter. When I dug in for the first bite, a wave of nausea and panic washed over my after realizing this was a piece of the bacon spinach quiche. I returned to the counter and explained that I had ordered the vegetarian quiche, and the chic who took my order asked the chic behind the counter which one she served, because she was sure she got it right. The chic in the kitchen said she put them out in the order she got them. Then they spent some time looking around in confusion and murmuring a bit,  meanwhile all the quiche had been sold. So the counter chic simply turned to me and send, "well we don't have anymore of that one."Thanks. I told her I was more upset about the fact that I had just put bacon in my mouth after other years of no meat than there being no more quiche. She did give me my money back, but no one apologized or offered me any recompense. I'm over you being cooler than me, but I'm not over you having no soul.
other I've been hearing good things about this coffee house in Cave Creek so when a friend suggested we meet there I was all for it. Easy to see furniture store Big Bronco and Janey's is behind it. Very good coffee and I'll come back to try the food.  Comfortable place to just hang out.
other Cibo is positively adorable.  I love the atmosphere.  I love the little house, and the yard.  I love the excessively busy yet amazingly friendly servers.  I love the iced tea.  I love the bread.  I love the Antipasto plate.  I love making ad-hoc bruchetta out of said bread and Antipasto.  I love the margherita pizza.Just on a Thursday afternoon alone, I don't think I'd ever come with a large group of people.  It just doesn't seem like a wise life decision.Really? It's love overall.  Love, love, love, love.  When I can, I'm dragging my family here.
other This is your typical Buffalo Exchange. I've been to others in San Francisco and San Diego, and they're all pretty much the same. Yes, they're super picky brand name whores about what they buy from you, but it means that there are some really great items for a much smaller price tag. I've gotten dresses that people always compliment and things that I've bought on impluse because I thought it was a great buy, and wore once. The building this one is located in leaves a lot to be desired, but  there are good buys inside. I walked away with a great pair of skinny jeans, a cute top, and a super comfy dress for under $50 =).
other Ok so who goes from California to Scottsdale and ends up at a Sprinkles? That would be ME. In search for a cute independently owned cupcakery to test how AZ cupcakes stack up to SF Bay cuppies... we headed to downtown Scottsale. WELL, not really for the cupcakes, but just to check it out. However, seeing there were a handful of cupcakeries nearby, we had to try one.BUT the reviews of other and 3 stars for some of these places seriously put me off. I hate dry cupcakes and I was not eager to spend precious calories on something that would not satisfy. Sprinkles had the better reviews and whala it was open after all the other places closed. (Note to self, who closes a bakery at 6pm? Cupcake freaks come out at NIGHT!)We have a Sprinkles about a 1other min drive from us@home, but have I ever gone??? NO. So yes here we are at Sprinkles in AZ. The gals are friendly, they answer my questions tirelessly. I end up with 2, lemon and chocolate marshmallow.They stay overnight in our hotel room since our dinner left absolutely no room for cupcakes. I was worried they'd be dry and stale the next morning when I busted them out at 7am before my workout. Gotta get some carbs in so I can burn them off right?Bottom line... Sprinkles may not be a cute little indy shop any longer but their stuff is solid. No mixes, the dark chocolate cupcakes are the perfect combo of dark, bitter, and sweet. The lemon was dense, I think mine is better, but the chocolate marshmallow OMG. It was like a grownup version of a Hostess cupcake, MY FAVORITE. Despite their overnight rest, they were not dry, the result of a fair amount of oil if the residue on my fingers was any indication.Please send me three dozen of the Chocolate Marshmallow please. I will love you forever. Thanks.
other It's my fav starbuck cuz it's across the street form my house. It taunts me daily. Pavlovian response make my mouth water for a white mocha nonfat no whip everytime. The people who work there remember the regulars and offer suggestions and even help you save money by working the angles to get you the combination special price.  Also a good place for people watching or picking up a little something on the way to the light rail or antiquing up 7th Ave.
other YUUKK!!!That pretty much describes this place.  We went there on Sunday afternoon for lunch.  Only other person in line in front of us.  I ordered the other meat combo, rib tips and hot links...sides of mac & cheese and potato salad.   ...it took about 40 mins to get my food.  But I told myself if it was good...then it's worth the wait.  But by God it wasn't good at all.  The mac & cheese had no flavor at all...i mean none.  The potato salad was very flavorless as well.  The rib tips would have been good if they weren't covered in other gallons of bbq sauce, nasty bbq sauce at that.  Their sauce is like a sweet and sour sauce...was not good at all.  The hot links were mixed in with the rib tips and covered in the same sauce.  So couldn't tell if they were any good, cause there was so much of that damn sauce.The funny part was that the couple that ordered right after me, got their food and took it right back to the counter and straight out said that the food was just disgusting.  I wish I would have done the same instead of spending $15+ on nasty bbq.In short.  I will not be going back here.
other Great gluten free Italian place! Tell all you gluten free friends, they will love you for it!
3 Mark-Keyed My CarBy The RueIt's Friday night with nothing to do,How about a show, maybe The Who,Got in the Jeep,Hit the street,Drove out to Tempe,And went to the Marquee.Psychostick was the band I went to see,They sing a funny song about boobies,Tacos and Beer,Both songs I did hear,Watch out for the Narc,Five dollars to park.Fully stocked bar is good to know,Go with friends, take home a ho,Steal toed boots,Dyed hair with roots,Get into the pit,Deck the guy who hits.Snoogen!!
other I dined at this restaurant on a Saturday morning and was actually the very first guest.  I got greeted by the hostess and was promptly seated.  The service was phenomenal from when I walked over the door step and the ambiance is the restaurant was amazing .  I ordered the smoked salmon as an appetizer and the daily scallop special as the entree.When my salmon dish came out I said to my self "WHAT in the hell?" Two extremely thin slices of salmon, little salad, and a piece of bread with some aioli on the side.  Salmons cheap and they charged me $1other for this crap?  I work in the food industry and the food was crap.Next, the entree.  The waiter described the the scallop dish like it was heaven on earth.  Explaining to me how delicious this special was.  So I took his advice and ordered.  When the dish came out I said to my self again "What in the HELL?"  Four small scallops, other baby carrots, broccoli rabe, and cilantro sauce.  The scallops weren't seared enough, the broccoli rabe was brown and mush, and the baby carrots were still raw.  The funny thing was.  The sauce didn't even resemble any cilantro flavor at all.  I could of made this dish 1000x better and the entree took a big hit in my wallet, $3other for crap.The meal came out to roughly $60 and I left that restaurant to never try it again.  I could of gotten some pho for $8 would of been a hundred times happier than spending money that wasn't even mediocre.
other Had a very nice meal in there on 5/10. Bengan bartha was tasty and the only poor part of the meal were the nan breads, they were not at all fresh. Good prices though and good service and Fullers ESB to boot!!
other Whenever I'm looking for a quick healthy lunch, and am tired of salads from the grocery store, I swing by Zoe's Kitchen on Camelback. For a long time I used to get the spinach and chicken quesadillas, however last time I went in, I realized they didn't have them on the menu anymore. The manager that was on duty was super friendly and helpful, and explained it was now basically the spinach roll-ups (add chicken). I must say, they are even more delicious!Is it your cheapest lunch option? Probably not. I'm a frugal person by nature, but it definitely beats eating Fast Food. So it's worth the extra buck or two to know you're not loading yourself up with tons of grease and carbs. I've introduced a lot of my coworkers to Zoe's and they all love it too. Now if only they can open up in Gilbert or Chandler near where I live!
3 Hmm...this place has a good lunch happy hour, but the choices in the menu are kindof limited.  The food isn't bad, but it's not amazing.  So, three stars for being average i guess?I do come back every so often so I guess it's a plus.
other While waiting for Ayesha to have dinner at Thai Elephant, I tried not to let the meth-crack-head who pretended to talk on the pay phone deter me from a great meal.  She had no shoes on and walked up to the pay phone and started talking.  It hadn't been ringing and she didn't dial a number.  I'm a sucker for Touch of Thai's catfish dish, and they had the same one on the menu.  It was good, but the fish was a bit overcooked.  I would have liked a bit more "sauce" as the dish was a bit dry.Service was excellent.  My iced tea was refilled without asking throughout our meal.Of course, spending and evening with Ayesha over spicy food as we both wiped our noses from the heat of curry can't be beat!
other Wine, booze and cigars. And friendly staff. There's not much else that needs to be said. Oh and great prices.The selection and prices they offer are great. The aisles are wide and clearly marked. The cigar room has a great selection as well and the prices are low.
3 I stopped in on my lunch break.  The BBQ isn't bad for a fast food type of place.  I had the brisket on this particular visit.  The BBQ sauces weren't the best I've had.  If you are in the area and looking for BBQ, I recommend Pork on a Fork.
other We tried the caviar before our appetizers this time, a choice between two types - we picked the Osetra.   Caviar is served with mini toasts,  minced shallot, minced hard boiled egg white, minced hard boiled egg yolk, capers, creme fraiche, and I'm sure I'm forgetting other items served with it.  What a treat.  As usual, we enjoyed chopped salad, fillets, scalloped potatoes, asparagus, espresso, butter cake, and a fantastic Cabernet.Another A++ experience at Mastro's!!!!!
3 The server could have been better. She spilled a coke on my lap. This made me late for my movie. The wait was so-so however the food was cooked to my liking. I will go back.
other This place loses out due to poor customer service, which is a shame, because the food is good.  it didn't used to always be this way.  It used to be good food with a friendly, attentive staff, but then they changed management. Our first experience with the new management and staff wasn't great.  Service was slow, but we figured they must be busy so we let it slide.  Then we bought stuff from the market.  They have two registers side-by-side--one for the market purchases and one for the restaurant bills. We went to the restaurant register so we could pay for our market purchases along with our meal.  First of all, we got ignored and had several customers taken before us, despite the fact that we were there first.  When they finally decided to acknowledge us, they told us we couldn't pay at that register since we had a market purchase.  Rather than just sliding over to the next register and taking care of the purchase there, they made us wait in line again.  Finally we checked out...and were overcharged.  We didn't realize this until we got home and by then it wasn't worth going back. We decided to give them another chance and went back a few weeks later.  This time the service was even more slow. 1other minutes passed before we even got our water.  4other minutes later our food still hadn't arrived.  The waitress kept speeding by our table and ignoring us.  We snarfed our food down fast when it finally got there since we had to get back, and went to pay.  Long wait again as we got ignored for other customers who came after us, and then they overcharged us.  Again.  Fortunately we caught it this time.  They hastily made the correction, without so much as an apology.  Rather, they acted annoyed that we were holding them up.  How about getting it right the first time if you don't want to do it again? So that was it.  I don't think we'll be going back.  It's really a shame, because the food is  delicious and this used to be one of our favorite places.  It's just a shame that the new staff sucks.  I can get good food elsewhere and not be treated like garbage and overcharged.
other So I've been at Solo Cafe for about other and a half hours now writing a paper and so far so good! When I first arrived here I was greeted by a very friendly barista who was happy to discuss the drink options with a first-timer. I settled on a mocha and it was delicious! I like that it wasn't scorching hot - so I could enjoy it right away instead of having to sit and stare at it for other minutes. Also I really like the atmosphere here. The place is pretty small (I like this in a coffee shop - at least until I get here and there's no where to sit). It's also pretty quiet, which makes it a good place to sit and study. My favorite part is that I have been here for a while now and don't feel obligated to leave like some places. The -other star is because the chair I'm sitting isn't very comfortable (hahah) but they do have couches, which is probably a better alternative. Also, they don't have a very wide selection of pastries/food. This is always a bummer when I go to a place to study. I'm generally pretty lazy, so I don't like having to stop working to go somewhere else to get food. Despite this I will definitely be returning soon!(Anyway, my Yelp break is over... back to the paper) :(
other Great for young kids... tons to do and see
other How can I not show yelp love for the original fro yo shop that kept my addiction fulfilled in the early days of the fro yo phenomenon? Yes, that is what Golden Spoon is to me. When I first moved to Phoenix from college, I was coming from an area that was overloaded with frozen yogurt shops for the college girls who shared my love of the frozen treat. Unfortunately, Phoenix hadn't quite yet jumped on the bandwagon and so the only choice was Golden Spoon. To make matters worse, the only locations were north on Shea or South in Awatukee. So, since I was living in Old Town, the Shea location was typically my choice. I can say that I added several miles on my car very willingly to treat my taste buds to Golden Spoon. Yes, it was the closest shop to me but it's also creamy and completely delicious. The frozen yogurt is served by staff and comes in different sizes. You can choose from multiple toppings and it's just your "old fashioned" frozen yogurt shop. I'm using old fashioned very loosely in this sense, since frozen yogurt is anything but old fashioned, but with the self-serf trend, Golden Spoon is "old fashioned" compared to that. I don't visit Golden Spoon as often as I'd like anymore because it is still a bit of a drive, but anytime I'm in the area, I know just exactly where to stop for a sweet frozen treat!
other Waffle House was packed, Over heard another couple taking about "Fast Eddies", With a 20 min wait ahead of us we decided to try it out. Walked in looked like a senior center. Tables and chairs were very out dated. We sat down in a booth. Food was still on the table and the cushions were dirty. Waitress came over after 10 min and asked what we wanted to drink. 10 min later she brought out or coffee. Placed the order waited another 20 min to get the food. The diner wasn't busy at all. I don't know why the wait was so long. The food was ok, service was horrible. One thing that really grossed me out was the a/c return next to the office door. Look up and you will see probably years of dust that has collected. I showed the waitress and she really didn't care. I told her that if I would of saw that when I came in I would of just walked out. GROSS! Sorry Waffle House I will never betray you again.
other Wow... i don't think I've ever been in a more narrow place.. ever! but it was just perfect in ever way!!! They have tables along one side and a bar with tall stools along the other side... you can watch them make your food.... its like the food network... but live and you can smell it :) my coworker and i sat right in front of the oven... every time they would open the oven i would only get hungrier!! :) we could see all the fresh and yummy ingredients!! i had the Reuben (Pastrami, corned beef, homemade sauerkraut and Swiss with a side of 1000 island dressing) WOW... it was amazing... for their sauerkraut they use red cabbage... it was more sweet than bitter... and the crust of the pasty was flaky and buttery... so delicious!! and i honestly forgot how much i love corned beef! over all it was very rich... but great to share.... My Coworker had the Italian.. (pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil, tomatoes and marinara sauce) it looked great... he loved it... you could see the fresh basil and tomatoes... it smelled divine we didn't speak for a full 20 minutes... just barley loud enough mmmmmmmms and o-m-g this is amazing... said quietly to ourselves.... all of the employees were so outgoing and laid back at the same time... just really cool guys... i loved the atmosphere and the attitudes that filled this place... i cannot wait to come back!
other I went to La Boca two night in a row, Sunday/Monday, when I had to be in Tempe.  The first night our party of six were enjoying our pizzas when I casually mentioned that we'd ordered one pizza without mushrooms and some had found their way unto it.  Within a a couple of minutes the manager was at our table with an apology and an offer to comp a couple of deserts.  Geez, it was just an errant mushroom!  In fact, the pizza here is very good and they clearly go the extra mile in trying to accommodate their customers.I was please enough to return the next night with my wife and share a Margarita pizza (which is very good).  Wanting something sweet to finish off our meal, we opted for the chocolate mousse.  While it may not have been the ultimate dessert it was quite good and we enjoyed several bites before deciding we'd had enough to satisfy without adding unnecessarily to our growing waistlines.  Seeing we'd only eaten a bit, the waitress comped the dessert.  We explained we'd been happy with the mousse and were just full but she took it off the bill just the same.  Now, there are a lot of choices where to eat and a whole lot of pizza joints, but for my money a little extra courtesy goes a long way.  Couple that with good food and reasonable prices and La Bocca is sure to see more of me.
other Nice spot, with a friendly staff.  The sandwiches were very good, and the ingredients all tasted very fresh.  The lady at the counter convinced me to try the cookies, and I was not disappointed.  Oh, and of course, try the cider, it's no joke. Mmmm.
other Excellent food! I do say the service isn't always the best, but the outcome of the food exceeds my expectations. Definitely recommend ordering the Artichoke Salad! Not what you'd expect out of a typical boring salad! Not just stuffed with a large amount of dull, boring lettuce, but filled with spices and tons of flavor.
other Always here for their California burritos... The burritos are huge and can be easily shared by two people.  Their jalapeno and carrots are somethin I havent seen at other similar places, id recommend it if you,re lookin for some heat! The drive thru service is fast and friendly.  I have seen they did remodel the inside seating and does not look as,roughed up as before... There is a drawback when using your card to pay- 50¢ addtl charge, which shud b done away with.
other just say no.this place is truly awful. too bad it's taking up valuable space on monroe.
other Went in to pick up lunch. I ordered the bean & cheese burrito (per Yelpers recommendation).It took a LONG time for my order to be ready, next time I will definitely call ahead. The price was awesome and the food was really good. I anxious to try more items on the menu!
other Cozy place, great amounts of food for little money, they serve koolaide!!!!  Its all great I loved it both times so far, once in 2003 when I went to review it for the school newspaper, and again 8 years later when I drove by it and the nostalgia made me try it again with the fiance
3 Food is a little pricer than standard Chili's, but it's in an airport so that's expected. Service was good, food came out quickly and to order. Be sure to stop by before you head through security.
other Get ready to get meat drunk, then fall into a meat coma!! Although this is not a nationwide chain, this is what a chain restaurant can and should be, it's great. You begin with an immaculate salad bar. Definitely the best one I have ever seen or tasted for that matter. Hell you have to love a salad bar that has a whole wheel of Parmesan cheese for you to enjoy. Enough with the salad lets talk about the star of the show, the meat!! Transcendental might be too strong of a word, but it is pretty damn close. It is endless amounts of meat prepared 1other different ways, all seasoned perfectly. You have to love something that is seasoned so well that if adding salt or pepper to it at the table would over season it. This place is pretty much a buffet that comes to you and after trying several meats its great because you don't want to move, lol. And the best part is, is that you tell them when to come to you!! I could go on and on but if you have about 60 bucks to spend and want to enjoy a great meal just go here and leave in physical pain from over eating like I do!!
other This is the best venue in the valley for what is intended to be; a midsize venue that attracts national touring acts, with a standing room only intimacy that you won't get at a place bigger or smaller. I saw Clutch here recently, and it rocked my balls off. I didn't drink at the place (took care of that before and after) so I can't comment on drink prices. Parking did suck, but there was a structure across the street for five bucks. One downside, going to the website to check out upcoming shows is tedious. The calendar is soooo hard to sort through, I would only go there to get more info on opening bands not listed on ticketmaster.com
other Great groceries and fantastic service, keep it up.
other Very good food. The tepanyaki was great!It does have a certain atmosphere though. Remember to dress appropriately. It can also be a bit pricey.
other My brother also posted about our Mother's Day experience. These must be franchises because the Scottsdale and Chandler locations are like eating at a different restaurant entirely. This is the second and last time we will frequent this location. The pizza and calzones were awful.
other Open 2other hours on week-ends, ample seating area (good for studying or hanging out and chatting), very welcoming clientele, and broad selection of coffee drinks, non-coffee drinks, and desserts, fruits, and random snacks.The coffee isn't great but not terrible either. The Wi-Fi, while free, is fickle. One of my two favourite coffee places in Tempe (other is Cartel off University & Ash).
other The salad plates were not chilled... As they usually are it however is a busy night but something's are expected at the olive garden... The food tasted like it was under a hot lamp for so long it tasted almost hard and also under cooked for the seafood... Not a great experience at the olive garden there are certain things expected... The expectations are not that high shouldnt be that hard to do....
other We live in Chandler, so we get take out here probably once a month. My husband is from the east coast and in both his and my opinion, these are the best cheesesteaks around! We love their spicy peppers (they are hot!) and while I am not really a cheesesteak fan, their chicken cheesesteak sandwiches are fabulous! The owners are hard working and really appreciate all of their customers and let you know it! We have been eating here for three years now and have never had a bad experience.
other Arai pastry is so delicious!ironically i come here not for the sweeties: confections, cakes, cookies, cremes, not being my style- but for their delicious savory treats! The breads they make here are top knotch, the various salty pastries are all worth exploring, the red bean one and the curry filled ones being my favorites. But the real deal, the Coup de grâce, the mamoth reason of what makes this little japanese pastry shop (in my mind) is their sandwhiches/ green tea shakesthat powerful one two punch of savory sagacity is what makes me want to live sometimesyes yesi find the world to be a better place with those items in my tummy
other Simply the best Ethiopian I've ever had.  Grew up in VA with DC as my stompin grounds (home of a large Ethiopian population) and even had a good amount of Ethiopian home-cooked meals by friends and none was as good as this place.  I go to AZ once a year for work and each time I am sure to stop in.  I usually get the veggie or meat-lovers meals since they tend to be such a good bargain, but have also ordered separate items as well.  The vibe is casual and the service is excellent.  The staff have always been very friendly --- another reason I keep going back.
other The customer service at this Macy's was seriously out of this world. Both my mom and I (who were visiting from out of town; me, San Diego and her, Baltimore) have never ever experienced such friendly and helpful customer service at any department store, anywhere, EVER! We were there late at night- probably for the other hours right before closing on a one day sale day. In every single dept. We went (ladies dresses, ladies shoes, men's etc) EVERYONE was soooo nice and helpful. Most of our visit was in ladies dresses. Those reps did everything possible to help us find dresses in different sizes (which can definitely be challenging at the end of a season and at the end of a one day sale when things are haphazardly placed everywhere) and to call other Macy's stores when we were unsuccessful in finding a dress at that location in a particular size. Sure, they wanted a sale, but to be so helpful so late at night, right before closing, after a long one day sale was shocking. We must have encountered at least 10 different sales associates while wondering through the store and each and every one was soooo nice and helpful. The selection (at least in women's) was better than most other Macy's I've been to, to boot. I wish this was my local Macy's! Go here- hopefully your experience is just as good as mine :)
other Very nice place with a great concept in Tempe, AZ.  All I want to know is.......Where are the duck fat fries?
other I was here not too long ago.  The place is cute and when you look at the menu, you can't help but be get excited to go there the first time.  But its one of those places that after trying it the first time, you never have the same excitement to eat there and when debating where to have dinner on a given night in the area, Main Ingredient always comes up as your third choice in case the your first two preferences are either closed or packed.  Meal:  We both had sandwiches and a side of the mac and cheese.  I can't remember what local beers we had, but they were excellent.  They have a terrific beer selection.Taste:  There were many, many delicious choices on the menu and sadly, the food is not as appealing as billed on the menu.  Its still good, but it doesn't live up to the hype.  7 out of 10.Value: I thought the prices and potions were very and reasonable, but the real value is in their happy hour specials. other out of 5.Service/Cleanliness:  Our server was very attentive, silly and friendly.  Her recommendation for craft beer was dead on.  9 out of 10.Atmosphere:  I hate to repeat what others have said, but the atmosphere is a perfect place to chill out at.  I recommend this a top place for "Friday Afternoon Drinking Club".  other out of 5.Overall:  If you are in the area, you should give it a shot.  I think the next time I visit, it will be just for a few drinks and an appetizer.  2other out of 30 points, other out of other stars.
other I waited 45min and ended up with a tiny gross little serving of tortilla with vegetable scraps thrown in it, served in a aluminum take-out box. The tables are folding tables, like the kind you play beer pong on. And they have pictures of kids and babies on the walls and signs asking people to send in pictures of their kids for the walls too, which has nothing to do with Asian/Mexican cuisine, it creeped me out.
other You can't give anything less than other stars to a place that sells bra's and panties to hot chicks.
other I've visited the Crudo in Old Town and was really excited when the new one opened in Arcadia.  Visited with the bestie a nice quiet weeknight to enjoy some girl time.  You can get a 3 course meal for $3other and pick from salads, meats or what I would call side dishes.  It's a bit pricey for what you get portion-wise, unless you decide to order 3 meats..but who does that?  The wine is very reasonably priced.  The food is amazing!  Everything is cooked and seasoned perfectly, and presented to be delicious.  The decor is very simple, feels like you are in a big open warehouse.  It'd be a great place to have a group dinner for 6-10 as they have these rooms that are a bit more secluded they could put you in.  The service was a bit too good, to the point where we almost felt like she was rushing us even though there was nobody else in the restaurant.  I'd visit again, but this is definitely a place to take another food loving girl friend- the boyfriend would be hungry and feel ripped off, it's just not his style...
other The only good thing is the cheesecake. The food is terribly mediocre. And I hate how they seem to all be decorated like ruins of some sort. I want some damn food not an expedition with Fernando!
other Best toasted subs... EVER. I order the White Widdow and pretty much stick to that. It's awesome. The cheesy garlic bread... delish! Try it with pepper jack =) This place is a regular for us when we want a good sandwich. Hey... even my mom loves this place.
other Blurb for iPhone App: Great Enchiladas, Chips and Salsa made fresh, but beans left something to be desired.  Give it a try nonetheless.I just wrote the last part because I will be on the Yelp app, and notice that I often start my review with something that is not useful at all... which is that everyone sees when searching on their mobile phones.  So I guess you could say I'm optimizing for mobile.  Ok, now on the full review.  Took off a star for the beans... they just weren't great.  The person with me had a taco salad, and said they didn't get a lot of meat in it... and the rice was good, but not great.  However, this was balanced by the chips and salsa (which I always eat so much of that I'm not hungry by the time the food shows up) which seemed to be made fresh, not too hot, but with plenty of flavor.  The "hot" sauce (hot is entirely objective here) was very good, and I used that for my chips as much as the salsa.  Didn't ask if they had anything hotter, as the true chilehead will think it's pretty mild...I had a chicken enchelada with green sauce and a cheese with red.. and although I usually like the green better, the red here is great.  One word of advice however - don't step on the scale the next morning, because you are going to stuff yourself while you are here.
3 Very small selection. I am used to seeing a larger inventory of fine dresses and only found one that was nice! I also felt like I was maneuvering through an obstacle course with all the people in there and the poor arrangement; this is a messy and busy store.
other Our server Gary was awesome. Food was amazing...an experience.
other In short - Jen rocks!Finding someone I trust to watch my crazy crew is always a bit nerve-wracking.  I came across Jen's Pet Sitting while searching for options, since I'm relatively new to the area.  I decided to book a consultation with Jen to have her meet the furry family and learn more about her and her services.  Jen is extremely professional and came ready to take notes and also spent a lot of time getting to know my critters.  It was clear from her interactions with my cats and dogs that she loves animals and really understands them.  After having a great experience with Jen during the consult I booked her to do visits over a long weekend.  The hubs and I took our dogs along for the trip and Jen looked after our cats while we were away. She gave us regular daily updates about our cats while we were gone.  Sometimes she sent pictures with her updates which was an added bonus!  Jen spent time playing with our cats during each visit which was fabulous.I always know I've found a wonderful petsitter when I come home and my animals are a little disappointed to see me!  We will definitely continue to use Jen in the future.
other I was just thinking how long it's been since I've been to trivia on Tuesday nights and it made me sad.  I definitely need to get back into my trivia groove!Other than missing trivia, I'm seriously craving some Jamaican Jerk Wings.  YUM!!  Not to mention the delicious guac that they'll make at your table if it's not too busy.  Great bar, one of my faves.  Great servers/bartenders and fun, come-as-you-are atmosphere.  Not a typical Tempe bar which is quite refreshing.
other Was here on a Saturday afternoon.  WOW, the place was popping!!!  It is bright, colorful, and clean.  The menu is on the wall.  There are so many things on it.  I settled with a Thai Iced Tea Slush + boba.  The bobas were soft and a good texture.  I am interested to try the other items on the menu.
3 I tried a few different kinds of pizza and they were all okay.  A few people had told me that they made "incredible" pizzas, but I didn't really think so...I'd say they were pretty good pizzas.  What I liked were the fresh tasting vegetables which topped some of the pizzas.  The cheese was a bit disappointing, especially since I don't think you can really go wrong with cheese...it just lacked flavor.All in all, I probably wouldn't go back...it just really wasn't all that impressive.
other This review is for the Chandler location.The food here is pretty good. We came here twice during my last visit to AZ. We tried the nachos, the 7 layer dip, the guac and chips. The nachos were really good (make sure to add steak or chicken, both are great), and they give you a lotta guac too. The 7 layer dip was kinda dull, like they scooped out the filling of a microwaved bean and cheese burrito. Either way, all their food is pretty cheap, and during happy hour, drinks are a great deal. Also, I like the way the place is set up; most of it is outdoors/patio, so it makes for a different experience. There's also a lot of games and things to do. We saw a group of guys playing beer pong on one of the tables, and by the women's restroom there's a lobster catching game. We'd spent like 1other bucks on that game and didn't win ourselves a lobster but we got close one time, and it was pretty damn fun.
3 This place has a lot of potential; I really want it to do well. I went there on Saturday night with my husband around 7 pm and it was jam packed. Good for them! We felt a little out of place since it was a much much older crowd, (in bad capris, shorts and flip flops...doesn't anybody make an effort anymore? This part of town, I guess.) Anyway, we had a nice booth, but it was directly across from the pizza oven, so we were quite warm. Pleasant server, good busser/foodrunner keeping our waters filled. We decide to try the Bruschetta for a starter and the Rib-eye dinner for two for $28...an unbelievable price. The Bruschetta was quite good (and at $6 also a good value) and with a nice mozzerella and balsamic drizzle...it was tasty. The Rib-eye's on the other had, were not so nice. But, I must stress, these meals were $1other each...what did I expect? The steaks were large and tough; my husband said his tasted old. Yikes. Mine wasn't that bad, and the potatoes and veggies were flavorful. Our thoughts, under the premise of "if we were running this restaurant", are: we would have offered a much smaller but higher quality piece of steak. Food for thought, Javino's. In our opinion, quality over quantity every time.  As we were eating we were able to keep an eye on the drama with the staff...and  watch how hard those boys in the kitchen were working! It was really busy, and they all did seem to work well as a team, manager included. At one point, a sweet, young server comes back with a couple of plates to the manager  (I guess someone sent back there food) and burst into tears. Ah, we felt so bad! I hate it when customers make the server cry and if the food was no good how on earth is that her fault?! Well, major points to the manager who gave her a big hug and went to deal with the table. I was impressed. Also, live music going on... a very nice touch. We left feeling like it was an okay place, I liked better than my husband, but something was just kind of "off". Maybe they have an identity crisis? Are they a wine bar or are they trying to be fine dining? Either way, I definitely want to go back again soon to try something else on the menu. If for no other reason than how kind that manager was to the server. I have worked in the industry and have been treated like garbage in the same situation. So, kudos. Your staff looks happy.
other Killer sandwiches and dill potato salad that set my world on end.I wish I had known of Bertha's while I was in town for a long period of time because I would have eaten here everyday.  I went for the blue cheese roast beef sandwich which was a magical meal.  Lightly toasted bread, slightly sweet mustard mayo, fresh veggies and the most beautiful sliced roast beef I have seen in a long time, this sandwich was nothing short of awesome, damn it was good.  As a side I got the dill potato salad, this stuff is NOT your grandmothers potato salad, this is what your grandmother should have been giving you.  Holy wow, creamy dill potato greatness.  I am going to have to figure out how to get this out to me in LA.The deserts looked great and the little chocolate brownie cookie gave me an idea of how good the other offerings most likely are.Bertha's is awesome, fresh sando's, salads, wraps and potato salad that will redefine the potato.  Bertha's please open a location in LA, I will keep you afloat!
other Headed downtown to the soon-to-be-new-office with the boss today and had lunch here - he's lived in Phx for decades and recommended this place (although he hadn't been there in many years). I got a Super Sicilian. Absolutely delicious - the sesame bread looked like it would be hard/crunchy but it was soft and tasty. If I had to offer up any criticisms it would be 1) the fact that it inexplicably took something like 10 mins to make our sandwich - it just looked like it had been toasted, nothing else I could think of should have made it take that long, and 2) the sandwich was too small *8-) My mistake, of course. I got a whole, and could easily have downed two of those. Taste wise it's equivalent IMO to the "all-American grinder" at Uncle Sam's, except with the latter you can also get jalapenos. Will definitely return here once our office shifts downtown, but next time I'll get a sub and a half, methinks!PS: Parking? The boss just parked his Ram 2500HD and toy trailer around the corner on the street in front of someone's house. No problem and no parking meters. (shrug)
other I was a dim sum virgin until yesterday!  My wonderful wife Audrey W was there to share my experience with me as were Dottsy Z, Donald S, Marian and Kevin H.  And Dottsy has pictures too!  And wow did I get off cheap!  The best dim sum I have ever had!  Honestly, the only dim sum I have ever had!  I'm so glad I had other yelpers that were experienced to share it with and help me enjoy the first time!Seriously, Phoenix Palace has really good dim sum.  I enjoyed nearly everything I tried, there was tremendous variety and high quality through and through.  I was not quite as adventurous as some of the more experienced folks at the table.  I did pass on a dish that featured tripe.  Sorry.  Maybe I wasn't ready to go all the way.The review trend has risen over the last few months.  I think I heard there was a change in ownership or management or possibly a new chef.  Or all of the above.  I don't know but it was good.For 6 people and loads of food the total was just under $70.  Unreal.Great lunch spot for dim sumderful variety and a total bargain.  Phoenix Palace is in the same parking lot as Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket so you can fill up on dim sum before you do your shopping.  Then you'll spend less when you go shopping.  Never go shopping hungry.
other Home made fresh noodles.  Reminds me of San Francisco china town food.
other I shop here a lot.  They've been accepting expired coupons, which is great and every little bit helps.  Returns have always been a breeze too as there isn't a deadline, should you receive a gift, don't have a receipt, whatever the reason.  SO (yes, here it comes--the negative, which I always include) when the snippy girl (rare in this store) that I've never seen before when shopping here so she must be green to the policy?, inspects the item (no biggie--make sure it's there and intact), I start to wonder just a tiny bit.  This is all after she made me wait for maybe 3 long minutes while she failed to address me standing there.  She asks why I'm returning, which I explained but nothing was defective.  Then there's a problem with the amt so she calls a manager, THEN she tells that mgr "She's returning it because......" as IF.  The mgr ignored her, as she didn't inquire about my reason, which BBB doesn't really give a @&*^ now do they.  Or perhaps she thought she could announce it so the line behind me could look in disgust as they waiting to BUY something waiting for another cashier to show.  Didn't bother me but what the heck did she THINK I was doing here.  At BBB, you can return anything, anytime, for any reason, no problem.  So why this twit couldn't fathom my reason is bbbeyond me.  That sort of attitude is a huge turn off and has she heard of secret shoppers, or just do your job with a smile, don't judge the customer, esp when the item returned is in NEW condition, unused and a very inexpensive return.  What a bizzo.  If they keep employees like that, I'm through.  STOP it. I feel much better now.
other You know, I've read some mixed reviews on this place. I enjoy going here. I think the pricing is reasonable, and I haven't had bad service. The food is pretty good (in comparison to other Phoenician Sushi restaurants).
other I have been to a buffet like this before, but I will never go to this particular one again. The food all looked fresh as we went through the food line selecting our favorites and stacking our bowl to the sky. We selected our sauces and turned it over to the grill. The cook doused our dishes with water, quickly cooked the ingredients, and returned them in a new bowl. There is a selection of crispy wonton bits, rice and soups for you to add to your tray at no cost. I selected no rice as they were all old and burnt to the pan. I chose the hot and sour soup because it is ma favorite. Free-range and refills on beverages. Sat down to eat, was not impressed. I could not muster to try a second spoon of the soup as it was absolutely disgusting. The bowl of ingredients were all bland, perhaps from the overuse of water at grilling, and I am almost certain the tofu had gone bad, The slivers of meat that my husband had selected tasted fowl as well. We obviously did not get to far into our meal before leaving. Had we not already paid there would have been several complaints from me, and changes in selections. We could have taken the left overs home, but opted to leave them instead. Suffice to say, I do NOT recommend.
other I was severely mislead by Frank A's, "It's hot, but the food ain't bad." review.  It was very cold and by far the worst food I've ever eaten.  You would have to drag me here in cuffs to get me to return.
other I have eaten here four or five times.  We always get the mussels to start, and they are always delicious and cooked just right.  The broth is great for dipping the bread in, although I could probably just use a straw.  The fish of the day was halibut.  It was very flavorful, but maybe just a tad overcooked.  The scallops were wonderful.  Great wine selection.  This place a lively atmosphere.  Not too noisy to hear across the table, but a good vibe.  The service was excellent.
other I used the drive thru early one morning on my way to work. I ordered a breve latte. It came as expected and was very good. A little pricey but I'm cheap. I hope this place stays in business. It's nice to have a neighborhood coffee shop that's not a chain. The drive thru option is great too.
other If you're looking for a lunch salad/Sandwich, this place is great.  Not too busy, but that's good because it's very quaint.  The roost beef and bluecheese sandwich will fill your stomach and the cookie side is a nice treat.
3 Was super annoyed by this Sephora. The first three times I was asked if I was "doing ok?" was not bothersome. By the tenth time I was asked, I really felt like the employees were going to frisk me. I had a baby with me! I really hope I don't have to do any holiday shopping here. I'd rather go somewhere else.
other I have come more and more to appreciate some of there beers that I use to not be a fan of.  I tend to like some of there seasonal's more then there regulars. I'm a big fan of there oatmeal stout and there bourbon barreled porter and pumpkin porter.   I spent most of my college career randomly showing up here for family dinners, reverse happy hours, 21st Birthdays and everything else in between.  There happy hour is pretty good with discounts on pints and pitchers, but I really wish they would add food to it.  There food is good, I have yet to find something I didn't like on the menu.  Overall, great place for dinner or even to hang out on the patio and have a few beers after a long day.
other I've only ever had the carne asada quesadilla and churros, but they are damn good.
other Great place!  I love that they feature wines from "the little guys."  You won't find most of what they feature at any Total Wine or Bevmo.  Small business supporting small business... totally awesome in my eyes!  The staff is knowledgeable and ooooh Chef Sarah - your food pairings with the wine in the wine 10other course were AMAZING!  Katie, the sommelier, is fun and she knows her stuff, plus it is clear that she loves to share her knowledge of wine with everyone.  I'll be back for sure!
other This place is the best! They stopped doing tacos, but if your lucky! they do have them call before you go! Some outside seating (picnic tables) no seating inside. Take away only.They also have another location!!! Yea! In a strip mall on 5other ave & orangewood. They do serve "tacos" at this location!
3 Pizza crust & toppings are excellent. However the pizza sauce was too salty. I'm willing to try again later.
other Bizarre. My family of other came here for lunch one day, to see what all the hype is about - and boy did Hana fall FLAT! I personally had no expectations and Hana still missed them. Before seating us at a LARGE table (there's maybe 10 tables in this joint), this obviously inexperienced hostess first looked unsure of where she should seat us (the table for other or for 4?) She then proceeded to rearrange the table for 4, and moved ALL of the chairs around the table to add 1, instead of just adding it to the empty space on the end of the table.... odd.And then our waitress.... was really abrupt and ungracious about things. My sister's accompanying salad was half covered in lettuce rust - and when she showed the waitress, all she said was "so do you want it?" Uhm, no thank you, I like my food fresh, not rotten, but thanks.The sushi was pretty much the same thing covered in different sauces. Annnd they were pricey. it was kinda sorta really unbelievably ridiculous. RIDICULOUS, i tell you! Not worth it. No way. I'm quite sure that the "crab" was imitation. And the fish wasn't even that fresh. Granted, we're in the middle of a desert, but still. The one redeeming quality of this place? The ramen. Although there were about 10 noodles in it, the pork was perfectly cooked. And it would have been nice if the chef had been a little less stingy with the ramen noodles. Would I come back? Uhm.... only if I had no choice and was craving ramen. But for sushi? Save your money, go to Yen and get muuuuch better quality AND quantity.
other Had a great experience. DId not feel gouged or pressured and our dog got the proper treatment for dehydration.  Friendly staff. Prompt service. Special attention from Dr. Heinritz appreciated. Very professional.
3 Had a decent lunch here the other day with my co-workers.  We go here often for happy hour after work.The food was pretty decent.  The lunch menu is oddly full of mostly non-mexican style food.  That was odd.Service was ok until it got a little busy.  Then my cup was more half empty than half full.
3 I adore all of Joe's restaurants. That being said, I think this one is my least favorite..(which means it's still better than most of the restaurants I've had the pleasure of dining at in the greater Phoenix area.) I got the chicken sandwich and it was okay. I think I could have found something on the menu that I would have enjoyed more, but for some reason I wanted to try it. I think I'll have to try the pizza next time, because it looked amazing. The service and atmosphere were great, as per all the Joe's establishments. I wasn't completely fond of standing in line for awhile to get a table and order my food. Sometimes I just want to sit down at a table and have the server come to me after a long day.That being said, I would love to try this place again...especially for breakfast!
other Aww, too bad these guys went out of business.  I actually only went there one time, I live in Chandler, so it's just a little out of the way.  But I stopped through the drive-thru and thought if I lived near-by this would be my coffee place.  Whoever took my order that day was very friendly.
3 Saigon Nites is one of the few Pho joints on the North side of town.I ordered me a bowl of Pho as usual, but I think the waitress made sure I knew what I was ordering, so she repeated and asked "Beef Noodle Soup" ... Yes, "Beef Noodle Soup".  I forgot I'm in N. Scottsdale where culture can be lacking at times.  I'll have me a bowl of Asian man soupy stuff and some noodles - wink! I also ordered some ice coffee with condensed milk - can't have Pho without one of these drinks. Overall, the Pho is okay. I'm somewhat of a Pho Nazi and this didn't really past the test.  My ice coffee was excellent - Why?  It was served just right!  Not too strong and not too lite.  I'm really used to having it strong and simmering it off with some water to weaken it.  Not today my friends!  Service and ambience is okay.  I really enjoy the Vietnamese art here especially the portraits of the Ao Dai...Girls in Ao Dai - oh my! - Enjoy!
other While in the area we wanted something for lunch but knew we'd be having dinner out that same evening. Not wanting to fill up too much we ordered an appetizer and entree to share. The lettuce wraps with shrimp were so good! Fresh and crispy veggies accompanied seasoned shrimp all wrapped in butter lettuce leaves. It was light and tasty. For our entree we ordered the Hawaiian mahi mahi which came with a pineapple, red pepper and onion mixture over a bed of rice. The fish was a little overcooked but still tasted pretty good. Star for the water glass test!
other My meal at FnB last weekend was one of the best I've had in Arizona. I love everything about this place, the food, the cocktails, the staff, the atmosphere.It was a rainy Sunday. I knew the restaurant was right next to Cowboy Ciao, but managed to walk right by it (my friends noticed me go by). I turned back, and Pavle was nice enough to wait at the door, and said "Ben?" as I was about to pass by again. I agree with what everyone else said here, Pavle really makes you feel at home.I started with the slivered fennel salad and a ginhound. I split the order with a friend, and they were more than happy to bring the salad split  onto two plates for us. I love citrus, and these were a very refreshing start to my meal. Next up was the trout. It was presented stacked on top of the sunchokes and caramelized onions, with some wonderful broth on the plate. The combination of flavors was rich, and amazing, and the presentation ensured that every bite was as good as the last. I could eat this every visit, but I sampled the chicken and lamb, and was just as blown away. For desert I had lemon cake with ice cream and strawberry compote. FnB has been receiving a lot of positive buzz lately. It's well deserved. If you haven't visited yet, you're missing out.
other What happened to this place?  The food was good and seemed to have passionate folks who worked there.What a shame!  I think many were only just discovering it.
other I really don't like these types of Mexican food places because I feel my mom makes better Mexican food. Just a note: Not all Filibertos are the same. Food taste wise.....This Filibertos is BOMB though! They make great Spanish rice, and beans! All the food is great! But I recommend the rolled tacos if it's going to be your first time here. I think it's combo #8 haha. They also have some old school arcade games. That's a plus for me haha. Please stop going to Macayos they have the worst fake tasting Mexican food.
other Chopped Salad was fabulous, as was the lamb burger. Service was top rate.
other Yay!! This place is fantastic. Great pastries and atmosphere. I can't wait to go back.
other My husband and I ventured up to BLT Steak at Camelback Inn on Friday evening to celebrate our third wedding anniversary, which was two days earlier. We sat inside and our corner table gave us a perfect view of Camelback Mountain at night. Our waiter was super nice and did a great job of suggesting items and answering questions when we had them. There was a seperate server who kept our water glasses full all night - we couldn't take more than two sips without having them refilled it seemed like. My only negative about our waiter was that when it was time for a new glass of wine for me, he didn't check with me first to see if I wanted another glass of the same wine. I think we all know the common saying about assuming things...On to the food...here's what we sampled:Popovers - delicious. I was a bit skeptical about the butter and sea salt, especially since I don't like butter very much, but it was great! Caesar salad - good size and it was one of the best caesar salads I have had in awhile. Crabcake - my least favorite part of the meal. While it wasn't horrible, there was a bit too much celery for my taste and not enough crab meat.Cowboy Ribeye - since it was 2other oz, I graciously told my husband that I would have some of it so he could order it. Now those that know me know that I don't eat red meat because I don't like the taste. But I sucked it up and had some...holy crap, I had a few bites and said, "Wow, this is really good". So that should say something about how good it was. However, my husband did think the outside was a tad too well done, although the meat itself was cooked perfectly. While he liked the ribeye, he did think his steak at SW Steakhouse in Las Vegas was better.Mashed potatoes - is it possible to get divorced over mashed potatoes? I thought we were going to throw it down because one side of the potatoes was just not enough!! They were sooo creamy and delicious. Chocolate peanut butter mousse - we got our dessert for free since when I made the reservation I indicated we were celebrating our anniversary. The dessert was a nice way to end the meal, although the chocolate on top was just a touch too rich for my taste.With tip, our bill came to $16other which we did not think was bad at all for as much as we ordered. Unfortunately we didn't get to sit on the patio or enjoy the view at sunset, but I guess that means we'll have to go back which isn't a bad thing at all!
other Stopped in there December 17th. They have a great sound system that fills this large bar up nicely.  I got the sampler platter and it's all fried, and it was definitely edible, I was wanting more! Lot's of beers on tap. Chuck the owner is very nice and easy to talk to and always has a grin.  Julie is a hard worker and keeps the beers flowing, take of the wait staff and they will take care of you.  Oh they had a live band there, Whiskey Tango was the name of the band.  I left there with money in my pocket, this place will not break you, it's a working mans bar. I will definitely go back there!!!
other Wound up at Rock Bottom by chance had been wanting Carrabbas all day, due to being brain washed by commercials on TV so that when a friend said lets go out for dinner I was all gun ho to say Carrabbas, then he said Im in the mood for steak I tossed the pasta idea out the window and said Bring on the beef,  plus never been to Rock Bottom so I was thrilled at being able to try a new place! It was a Sunday night and the place was simi empty, which was nice. Service was fast and friendly and I liked the overall vibe of the place. I ordered the Texas Fire Steak which was top sirloin seasoned with crazy peper and smoking jalapeno butter, man it was delish!! Even the veggies were good!  Looking forward to another trip there to try out some more the menu!
other True Food Kitchen claims to not be a health-food restaurant, rather a place for great food that just so happens to be healthy. Whatever you want to call it, when you sit down, you'll be handed a card explaining nutrition guru Dr. Andrew Weil's food philosophies and explaining their ingredients and food items until you no longer have an appetite. However, give this place a chance - it's not all about health at the sacrifice of flavor. The decor perfectly highlights the culinary concept, with clean, modern lines, big open windows, and LOTS of green. Andrew's Elixir, one of their refresher drinks, was delightful. The best food item we had was the caramelized onion tart appetizer, with gorgonzola cheese, black figs, and caramelized onions on a crispy flat crust. It was the perfect balance of the sweet mild onions and sweet figs with savory cheese and light, crispy crust. Our server said this is the same crust as their pizzas, so next time I'd like to try those. Next, we had the edamame dumplings, which is basically steamed won tons filled with pureed edamame in a light miso broth. These were good, not great. For our entree, we ordered the black cod, but we had to send it back because it was so fishy (and undercooked). When I asked the server if the fish is fresh or fresh-frozen, he said, "Well, they're all fresh-frozen." Their fish entrees are $22, which seems inexpensive, but they're fairly small portions. For that kind of price in this type of restaurant, I would expect fresh fish. Perhaps the fresh-frozen fish is a cost-cutting measure in what seems to be the increasingly corporate Sam Fox empire. We went with the salmon instead, which was also undercooked but far less fishy. The roasted apples and pureed celery root were lovely, but the dish as a whole was a little overpowered by the mustard sauce, and the accompanying vegetables were weird. Prices overall are very reasonable, especially if you stick with appetizers, salads, pizzas, and sandwiches. True Food aims for the lofty goal of making great cuisine that just so happens to be extremely healthy, and occasionally misses the mark, but I give them credit for bringing Dr. Andrew Weil's philosophies on the importance of nutrition for the body and mind to the mainstream.
other "Honey I Shrunk the Lunch Specials and the Restaurant, too!" is more apropos of a name for Thai Basil. Now don't get me wrong, I like Thai Basil.  The food is decent and the interior is nice, but the tables/diners seem to be squished elbow-to-elbow New York style. Spartan, but slightly upscale, this restaurant ALWAYS seems to have a wait.  The yellow curry here is my favorite with a delicious balance of coconut, spice, carrots chicken and potatoes.  I can't ever seem to get enough, and I really mean that.  The portions here are small, and while lunch portions are expectedly small, portions elsewhere (at Chanpen Thai, for example) are larger and less expensive. Elsewhere the Thai BBQ chicken comes with 1/other a chicken, but at Thai Basil they give you three lonely strips like cheapos!  The massaman curry and pad thai are pretty good too, but I feel they're just OK.  I've had better.Service is hit or miss here.  One thing that's consistent: they always seem to be understaffed. Once when I was dining alone (at a 4-person table) they had the nerve to ask me to move while in the middle of eating, to a 2-person table. To me, Thai Basil is style over substance.  Not impressed.  Next.
other Hey, art is very personal so I won't pretend to be objective about jordre studio.  What I can tell you is that anyone who has the cajones to open their own studio and, more importantly, the staying power to be an ongoing entity is deserving of praise.  I have a friend who owns several of Kyle's pieces and they look spectacular.If, like me, you look for a personal connection with your art, you'll be hard pressed to do better than JS.  Kyle is outgoing and personal and, if you're especially nice, he'll share a Schwann's ice cream sandwich with you.  How about that for an artistic connection?!
other I see a lot of four stars...perhaps I'm too generous with my five stars. I'm a giver.Attended a party for Georgie on Friday night and had a great time. Easy to find, easy to park, easy to get a drink. Plus- HEY they have the same turbo nozzle a/c vents that I have in my home. I could live there. Exposed brick? Me too! Felt right at home.I love the way they display their art, I'm assuming from local artists. I would prefer to not have to walk down a flight of stairs after a night of drinking. However, no problems there - thankfully. :)
other The food is really good. I can recommend like other dishes that anyone would like. If not, try the soup and salad bar. My favorite dish is the Chesapeake Catch, but their Ultimate Chicken Sandwich and California Club Quesadilla are amazing also. The staff works well together and the managers know the value of loyal customers. The GM was GM of the Year before and he wants to make sure every customer who leaves is happy. The kitchen staff is also great.  Keep up the good work!
other This is a great dog park. There are two sides, a big dog side and a little dog side. There is a little bit of seating but you can bring a chair if you want. There is water for the dogs and pooper scoopers as well. Everyone that visits for the most part is pretty nice except for the occasional crazy lady who tries to discipline other people's dogs. The only thing that would make this dog park better would be if it had lights so you could come at night and if it had more shady areas for the hot summers!
other Superb gelato - some of the best I've ever had! The guy behind the counter is the owner, and he takes pride in his gelato.They only use real sugar, not high fructose corn syrup, and nothing contains hydrogenated oil.I tasted a few flavors and settled on the coconut... it was sublime. Definitely some of the best Gelato I have ever had. When I need a mid day sugar rush... I'll be back!
other I'd love to give these guys a better review, because they were very friendly and professional.  However, I was very dissapointed with the service I received.  I'll type the one sarcastic comment that I can't get out of my head and then I'll get to the more substantial feedback.  I thought a detail was supposed to be a little more DETAILED.Here are the positives, because I want to give credit where credit is due.  The guys come to you and are very polite.  They were a little delayed, but called to let me know which I appreciated.  Also, they do a great job at steam cleaning the carpets and the exterior wax job was awesome.On to the negatives.  When I came out to see the work they did, I immediately noticed several smudges in the interior which they cleaned after I pointed them out.  Also, I noticed a scratch on the passenger side leather seat and a hole punched in the carpet near the pedals.  Anyone who knows me knows that I am a DETAIL oriented person.  Those defects were not present in my car prior to this job.  To add to this bit of a let-down, a day later my boyfriend and I noticed that they didn't even touch my trunk!  They didn't even bother to vacuum it out!When you advertise on your website "showroom quality," I expect showroom quality.  Overall review: good job on the exterior, attention to detail in the interior was very poor.  I am really dissapointed that the attention to detail just wasn't there.  I was expecting so much more from a detail job.
other I found Lisa G's while driving through phoenix with a friend. The exterior looked promising and we prepared ourselves for a treat. We were in for a a shock! We ordered the antipasto plate and while there were serious issues with it, it turned out to be the best thing we were served. I ordered the chicken rolatini (the special of the day) and it was just plain bad! The chicken was dry and under seasoned, the Rosemary potatoes were soggy  and the veggie medley  (squash, corn, green beans, etc.) was over cooked and the juices spilled over into the potatoes. It was one of the worst $17 meals that I have ever had! My friend ordered the veggie salad and it was one literal hot mess. Just horrible food! I see that others had the mini burgers and bowl of balls and found them to be tasty. I wish I had ordered those. As it is this is one place I would never revisit or recommend to a friend!
other Very nice place with extremely friendly staff.  The food was similar quality to other Mexican food places in the NW Valley....good but not spectacular.   Very good portions for the price.  I don't live close by but will certainly go back when I am in the area.
other I'm giving them a other star review for how they handled a poor experience we had.  My family came here for my brother's birthday a few weeks back, and two of our four dishes came out undercooked.  We brought it to the attention of our waitress, who brought the manager Adrienne over.  They both apologized profusely and took the charges off of our bill, which is what I would expect.  We were polite and appreciative of their apology and really didn't expect or ask for anything else.  However, they also offered to give us a credit to come back another time so they could prove to us that it was just a one time mistake.We took them up on the offer, and sure enough the food was excellent the second time around.  Our server was fantastic, Adrienne came by to make sure we were happy, and the chef even came out to make sure we were pleased with the meal.  They really went above and beyond to make sure we left with a positive opinion of their restaurant.  Everybody makes a mistake once and awhile, but not everyone has such excellent customer service to correct it!  I will gladly return here as a result.
other Yay, even though I miss living in Coronado I am glad to be back at the Melrose America's.  If you have read any of my reviews you know how disappointed I was with Coronado America's rude service that I boycotted that particular location.  Now that I am back around Melrose I can once again enjoy Happy Hour Tacos and drinks, or their delicious breakfast burro and cochata.  If 7th St let you down try 7th Ave.
other Honestly I don't get it.  I went to Dos Gringos with a good friend of mine last weekend.  I had never been to Phoenix before so I was excited to see what the city had to offer.  After entering Dos Gringos we sat at our table for 2other minutes before a waitress came to our table.  She brought us other beers and never came back. After 40 minutes we decided to check out a new bar since we obviously weren't welcomed at Dos Gringos.  So we went up to the bar where I waited for other minutes so the bartender could take some pictures and shots with her friends.  What I didn't understand was there were maybe only 20 people there and at least 6 people working.  If I was the owner or manager I would be embarrassed to say that you run that establishment.  I will never return and I highly recommend you stay away from Dos Gringos as you will be disappointed.
3 Today was my coworker's birthday and this was his choice for lunch.  All in all it was pretty good, some place I would go back to.The chips and salsa - the chips were nothing special, but the salsa was very good - both a green and a red one were served.I ordered the enchiladas suizas, beef, with green chile.  They were pretty darn tasty.  The beef was a little dry, this was the only drawback.  They had great flavor.  I even finished the rice and beans - which I rarely do.I get very disappointed when I order enchiladas and I get a plate that is swimming in grease and/or enchilada sauce and/or drowning in cheese.   None of that happened here, which was fantastic!
3 Spinato's has great red sauce for the pasta but I prefer a more earthy pizza. High School kids love it though. This restaurant was a Chili's before, but they have remodeled and did a fabulous job. The take out door is discrete and the bar area is large and comfortable. Food portions are quite big and they have a nice selection on the menu.
other With all the hype before this place even opened I epxected a whole lot better. There are so may flavors lacking in the basic tacos. The tamales are so generic and dry.The place is nice and clean and the staff is friendly and the little salsa bar is a nice addition which I had to give this place other stars. If you want geat tacos go to Gallo Blanco or to Americas.
3 I don't drink, so my review will not be intoxicated by anything except the building.  I gave it two stars for the building.  They did a beautiful job with the remodel (I'm a mid-century and Haver fan.)  The food wasn't anything to write home about.  I have to admit that I'm particularly tough on restaurants filled with...I don't know what to call them...scenesters, I guess.  Service was ok.  Its not BAD, mind you, its just that I don't get it.  I guess if you're paying with credit cards all the time, you don't care how much mediocre food costs, as long as it makes you feel cool about eating there.
3 Had lunch here with Robyn N. and Rand H. the food here was ok and I liked it better before they did the so called renovation.All they did was add a mongolian BBQ and wash the windows. Some of my favorite things on the buffet were gone so I am dropping them down to 3 stars but still it was a good lunch.
other One of my new favorite lounges to go to with the girls.   1. I am a HUGE champagne fan 2. You can smoke on the patio 3. the drinks are great and 4. I LOVED the decor and atmosphere.  My friend and I were at Salt next door for a friends birthday party on a Friday night and decided to sneak next door for a drink to check it out.  The staff as a whole were awesome, everyone was very polite and sweet.  It has that chic feel with all the servers wearing cute corsets and dresses.  The DJ was great as well, fun music that kept the energy level up without making it too clubby and easy to still cary a conversation. Definitely a great new place to sit back and lounge in a place with a fun atmosphere and good service. Yay!
other I am obsessed with this place!  I cannot say enough amazing things...I love their exhibits...I love Arcadia Farms inside...I love the architecture and design of the building...I love the staff (they are so helpful)...the gift shop is fabulous (I got the cutest watch bangle)...I love the giant red t-rex out front...I love the kids area (or at least my son does)...I love the diversity of the art!  I would recommend getting a membership because it allows you to be able go all year long with your loved ones and family!  You can have weddings here and they are beautiful!  They have events here all the time if you sign up for emails or become a member...at least just go once and you will fall in love!
other Love this place, been coming for many years and recently stopped by for their italian sub.  Still as good as ever, these guys have great quality produce and a simple but yet complex style in their sandwiches. Little details make me appreciate them, ohh yeah and they have good tea.
3 Stacy's is so cute! I pulled up and its a little shack with some limited seating outside. Seems like most people take their food to go, but your more then welcome to eat at their tables if you like.When you pull up, you order at the window and they make the food for you while you wait.  There were a few of us hanging out in the parking lot at the time, which was kinda fun!  I got the BBQ Brisket to go, and it was a okay.  I loved the fact that it was smoked, and the BBQ sauce was on the side, so I could put on as much as I'd like.Menu's kinda limited but good, and pricing is fair.  So, I was checking out their make shift dining area, and I had to laugh because there was a spray painted sign above that said "man cave."  LOL.Place is cute, I recommend carrying out, and parking is kinda tight. Definitely a cute spot, and not a half bad place!
other I love this place because it's right next to my dorm and also, it's one of the few Mexican restaurants that I've found that actually sells a Mole (molay') dish (chocolate and poblano chile's if I'm not mistaken). Try the chicken Mole and you'll really like it... very authentic.Chips are great, as is the salsa. You can tell its family owned... you can ask for Mexican cokes too I think. I've gone here twice and I'd go again whenever the stomach callers.Sometimes they have a wandering mariachi guy. I always feel awkward when they come around because then you feel like you have to tip, but I think he sensed we were poor college students so he didn't come by.I'm not sure what you ordered that you didn't like (to the first reviewer).
3 Ra Sushi offers average sushi grade.  This chain of restaurants offers a hip atmosphere with loud music and a great place to take down some drinks while eating.  As an Asian I'm a little more passionate about the rating topic for Ra.  If you don't have much  to say about a restaurant please think about rating it four stars.
other I freakin love this place. My favorite thing is to sit and eat facing the counter and watch new people come in and get all confused. Now that's just funny. My first time I was the same way, like what the hell do I do here. Now I'm a pro. Stack it deep and use another bowl for smashing, Soba noodles piled so high it looks like a circus act getting the bowl to the cook. Mmmm....good.
other We have had nothing but good luck at this franchise so far. We've been here probably a dozen times. It's always clean and the food is fresh and the way it ought to be. Yum!
other You know......first when my girl dragged me here....i thought it will suck. Once I stepped in....well....BAM! Interesting colors fill my senses. I do appreciate the set up of this place and the quirky items I found. So yea it is a chick store but still managed to entertain me.
3 The Service is great.  The food is ok.  The salsa.....horrible.  Please rethink your salsa.  Oh, and if you order a side of jalapenos they charge $1.99.  I have never heard of a Mexican restaurant charging for jalapenos.  Overall, just an ok place.  There are better options on and around Mill.
other I had to try it.  I had to see what became of the space that was once the finest restaurant in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  The design of J & G made me think "Really?".  As Mary Elaines the space was elegant, regal, sophisticated, refined.  As J & G the space feels like a sleek flashy Vegas restaurant.  I am still recovering from that shock.  I was there to give it a try.  So here you go.Tasting MenuTuna Tartar (Delicious)Parmesan Risotto (needed salt, but good)Sea Bass (Excellent, so moist)Beef (Good, but excellent tasting steak sauce was ice cold)Chocolate Cake (Wow!!!)Cocktail/ WineSidecar (awesome)Some sort of big red wine.Our waiter was good and explained the menu very well.  There were some errors is service so I had to keep reminding myself this is not Mary Elaines.  Its a steakhouse.
other I got a coupon at a past Yelp event to try them out and I'm SO glad I did!  Massage Envy really exceeded my wildest expectations for a chain that offers affordable rates for massage therapy.  I was pleasantly surprised by the level of expertise and professionalism that I experienced!My massage therapist was Dannie and she worked through my trigger points and loosened my tight muscles with an intuition that I have rarely experienced.I highly recommend this place and hope to return soon!
other This is my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area. There, I wrote it...and I am sticking to it. First off -- fresh local, sustainable, organic are not just words on the menu and the website. Now, in places like San Francisco and NYC, this would be nothing notable, but in the desert, it is truly something hard to find. Aside from the practical, in the land of Fox Restaurants (True aside) and the big box store at the strip mall, there really appears to be little demand for a small, local restaurant on a farm. It's time to make new demands! It's time to say no to the next Zinburgergeist and try that little corner place run by your neighbor...but I digress. We enjoyed the Farmer's Feast and it was worth every penny of the $65/person. First, the house cured meats, including the head cheese, were amazing. Second, how often do you get a chef's menu where each person's plate is different? Not often. Ultimately we each tried 10 different items. And each item, was amazing. I would come back for the pasta alone, let along the perfectly cooked scallops, and melt in your mouth sliced fillet. The service was ideal. If you want to eat in 60 minutes, don't come here, but if you want to enjoy in evening of great food, do come here. I noted to the waiter that the previous night they had sturgeon -- something I haven't seen on a menu since N. California. I commented on how unique it is, etc...Of course, it was not available on the night I was there...or was it? When it came to our fish course, the waiter brought out sturgeon for me. The restaurant didn't have enough to have it on the menu, but the waiter clearly put in a special request on my behalf and made the effort to make a diner happy. Maybe if I offer to work on the farm I can eat for free...
other Yumm yumm yumm!   The burgers are fantastic and yummy!The service has always been top notch, fast and freindly.Love the inside and outside environment.    Could do without the TVs with sports playing on them...don't we get enough plugged in entertainment in our lives already?....but I'm probably in the minority.Kid friendly for those well behaved kids of course. :)
other Nice clean place with good food.  Shrimp burrito - pretty tasty.
other Having a record store in the Memorial Union always made me nervous.  Nearly everything in that building is specifically designed to rip students off and I didn't think that Hoodlums could possibly be an exception.Fortunately, that assumption was incorrect.  Hoodlums had a diverse selection, awesome sales, and an incredibly knowledgeable staff.  The went well beyond the pop charts and were always helpful.  The atmosphere was nice, particularly once they moved into the basement.The store suffered smoke damage in a fire last autumn and the store is not going to re-open in the union.  On their website, it states that it should reappear in the future in another location and I have my fingers crossed.
other Have been here twice. Everything is excellent as far as food quality.  It's pretty busy on most evenings and that can slow things down so if you think you might be in a hurry I would recommend something else. Service has been outstanding each time that I have been.  The food is good and they have a reasonably diverse wine lists with mostly national wine offerings. The prime rib is superb. Most meals will cost in the range of 15-30 dollars depending on pairings and w/o drinks. Definitely worth it for a nice night out.
other I have no idea why some people give bad reviews about this place. It goes to show you, you can please everyone. They are probably griping about something that their own fault...there are many people like that.In any case, my friend and I arrived at about 5:50 PM this past Sunday. It was pretty crowded, more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else. We were seated at 5:5other and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small "Here's The Beef" pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11" pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce!We had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42. So, everything was great and not like these bad reviewers. That goes to show you that  you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues.
other By far the best Mexican food in Scottsdale! Food and Salsa amazing! Service phenomenal! Great prices!!!!
other Came for the beer, stayed for the scenery.
other Here is a place that we love to go with the family...We tend to remortgage the house ever time we visit but hey with the current economic crisis who doesn't???It was a place we went all the time but lately not as often, not because the food isn't excellent but because it is quite pricey. The service is great, Hudson the manager is great, very friendly and always comes to say hello. He knows us by name and enjoys our friendly banter.The pizza is VERY fresh, the place is always immaculate and I've never had a problem with the food. If you are looking for great pizza this is the place, if you are looking for cheap well I'm afraid it isn't. They do have a frequent stamp program and using that will save you a few bucks in the long run.
3 Overall I liked this place and glad it is in the neighborhood.  The carne asada burrito was good and the ceviche was pretty tasty.  However, it seems that this is about all there is to the menu.  I was not a fan of the set-up of the restaurant.  It was way too crowded - yes it was lunch, but the flow could have been a lot better.  Overall, I will return when in the mood for carne asada.  Hopefully the kinks will get worked out over time and until then I look forward to supporting a local restaurant.
other If I could give it more than 5, I would.  Sweet Pea and I live down the street, literally DOWN THE STREET, from this bar.  We waited for it to open for what seemed like decades, praying that this was going to be the type of place that could become our local.  It has exceeded our expectations.  The atmosphere is amazing.  The drinks are amazing- every last one of them- but the margaritas are the best I've ever had.  They tasted like a fresh squeeze of sunshine that makes me happy inside.  Margarita Mondays- $other margs AND free food?  Happy hours are amazing.  New Year's Eve last year was amazing.  The other year anniversary party was amazing.  But most of all, the owner and staff are some of the coolest peeps that you'll ever meet.  Go here.  You will love it.
other Zia always has a great selection of both cd's and dvd/blu-ray.  And the great thing with zia, is you can trade in your old media - cd, dvd, video games etc, for credit toward buying new stuff.  I usually go thru my cd's and dvds, then head down to zia - trade it in and come home with something new.  If they do not have it, they order it and call you when it arrives.  The staff are always knowledgable and helpfull.  I have been going to zia in tempe for many years - and the chandler location is just a good if not better.
3 Styles of pizza can be so different. I have a hard time comparing a place like Boombozz to Grimaldi's. At Grimaldi's, they refuse to carry ranch because they don't want people dipping their pizza in it. At Boombozz, they offer ranch as soon as they set down the pizza.So no, Boombozz is definitely not the best pizza that I've ever had, but for their style of pizza, they are pretty good. Think traditional Domino's/Papa John's type crust with stepped-up, unique toppings and sauce. My husband said the crust tasted like a cheesy breadstick, and I think that's a pretty accurate description. We got the D'Sienna with an interesting tomato cream sauce, spinach, and tomatoes. The low quality cheese detracted from it overall, but it was still much better than the pizza at Oregano's.Boombozz is relatively new to town, but they seem to know their crowd well. It was pretty busy when we visited midweek. Big menu, lots of drink specials, TVs everywhere, ample seating... everything a chain restaurant needs to succeed. I'm sure we'll be back when we're eating with finicky family members who are too scared to eat anything ethnic.
other Humdinger!  What more is there to say.  It's the best sandwich ever.  It tastes even better on the weekends when Kids Eat FREE!  If you have a larger family ( more than other kids ), this is the best deli in town.
3 If only they have more fresh produce I'd stop by a lot more often!
other Hands-down my favorite pizza place in the East Valley.  I have been going to Sourdough pizza for close to 1other years, and it is consistently delicious.  I grew up in Mesa, now live in Phoenix, but I make it a point to visit Sourdough Pizza when I am in the Mesa area.  The decor definitely leaves something to be desired, as they are in a stucco strip mall, and their interior probably has not been updated  all that much in the 1other years I've been there.  But I could care less when the food and prices are this good.
3 I can only give this place an OK because that's just what I have had from them so far- food that was ok, not slap your grandma good! The menu is kind of hard to understand but I know that I like chicken pho so I ordered that the first go-round and just wasn't wowed like I wanted to be. The noodles were good but the broth just wasnt to my liking. The second time I had pork noodles (dry) and it was better but still not GOOD. JD had the spicy noodle soup and that was good too, but , again, you guessed it-OK. I haven't given up on it yet because it is so close to my house and the people are so nice and friendly.  Any suggestions on what to order won't be ignored.
other The closest thing I have to a neighborhood pub.  Not bad.They sell loads of Belgian and Canadian beer.  That is all that you need to know.
other This place screams, "NO"!  Indoor seating?  No.  I ate outside in the heat.  Water?  No.  I asked for a cup of water with my meal and was told they only have bottled water and soda for sale.  Straws?  No.  I walked to Safeway to get a gatorade and they don't even have a straw for me to use.  Can I use the Now Groupon for a 14" pizza?  No.  Only good for the 12".  The groupon wasn't clear and the cashier didn't tell me that until after I ordered and bought the Groupon, which I told him about when I walked in the door.  To add insult to injury, all toppings cost extra.  some are $1.90 each.  Plan to spend a lot of money and be underwhelmed with mediocre pizza if you don't head the warnings posted here.
other out of the three filipino restaurants in Mesa i think this is the best, lots of choices in the food, and the cantelope drink is a must have.  the portions are really good, and price is very reasonable.  i took my friends there last week and they liked it.  only thing i ask the cook though is too go a little easier on the grease, but than again it wont be a filipino dish if there weren't grease oozing out of it  lol
other Best prices and a huge selection. I love their single bottles of beer isle where you can mix and match your own 6-pack of beer. Some of my favorite beers I can only find here.
3 Food is good. Don't take kids though.Kids pasta was $7 with no accompaniments.
other I know that all Melting Pot locations gets mixed reviews... usually the price turns people off.  It is a little pricey, but it's all about the experience.  Also, since it's a time-consuming experience, one tends to be there about twice as long as at a regular restaurant.  So I don't really mind the price for a once in a while kind of thing.  My hubbie and I have been 8-10 times... twice at the Scottsdale location.The husband and I always order the "Big Night Out," generally the "Lobster Indulgence."  (We figure if we're going to spend a pretty penny, we might as well really make it worthwhile.)  Maybe since we always do the lobster thing, the price doesn't bother me as much.Don't remember the specific themes the times we went to Scottsdale, but the "Big Night Out" meals go like this:  Cheese Fondue (you can choose the special or any from the regular menu) with assorted dippers, Salad Course (again, the special or off the menu), Main Course (if you get the "Lobster Indulgence," it includes twin lobster tails, usually a couple kinds of beef (e.g., filet and sirloin), shrimp, chicken, salmon, and/or pork, often a stuffed pasta, and lost of vegetables) with assorted sauces, and the best part... Chocolate Fondue with fresh fruit, brownies, marshmallows, Rice Krispies Treats, etc.  Yummy!I must say that your experience also really depends on your server.  If you get a bogus one, you might not have a great time.  We've had good experiences for the most part, some absolutely awesome experiences.Also, check out each location's web site prior to making reservations.  They sometimes offer really great deals or promos, especially on weekdays.  This info might be helpful to those who feel like the regular price is over the top.
other The name says it all.  This family owned restaurant (3 to be exact) specializes in tortas but they also carry your staple Mexican fast-food affair you would find in AZ.  Everything I or anyone else has had has been solid.  Just in case you don't know what a torta is, the best way I can explain what one is that it is essentially a toasted sandwich with a fusion of Mexican and American ingredients.  When it comes to TEG's tortas, there are a few standouts.  One would be the cochinita.Cochinita which is marinated pork is absolutely delicious by itself, but in a torta, it is absolutely scrumptious!!!  My best description of what cochinita is to think of pulled pork that is braised in a slightly sweet, salty, and spicy redish/orangeish sauce.  In addition, it has American sandwich staples such as mayo, shredded lettuce.  What makes it a "torta" are the slices of sweet and sour pickled jalapenos and carrots and slices of avocado (and they do not skimp).  What completes the sandwich, I mean torta, is the bread.  It's always warm and fluffy in the inside and the outside always has a nice crisp texture from the grill. The other torta I would strongly recommend is the carne asada.  The combination of the carne asada steak with mayo, fresh pico de gallo, and lettuce along with the warm bread makes this torta an absolute winner (my mouth is actually watering just thinking about it!).The Cubana, which has your typical ingredients that come with any spin on the classic Cuban, is also good.  If you are a big fan of Cubans, then this one may be for you. But in my humble opinion, this does not anywhere near come close to the yummy goodness of the cochinita and carne asada.The Hawiiana (Hawaiian) is also a relative good choice.  With the combination of Ham and fresh grilled pineapple along with other condiments, it also is descent selection.As I stated before, they do have staple Arizona style Mexican fast-food here and there are a few I would recommend.  One would be the flautas (large deep fried rolled tacos).The pollo is the one I would suggest.  If you envision your typical fried rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese, well this is not that, this is even better!  The flautas at TEG are larger with much more stuffing then your typical rolled tacos.  In addition, they make them with yummy flour tortillas, not your typical corn.  The shredded chicken is well seasoned and moist.  The tortilla is always fried perfectly, light crisp on the outside with the inside of the tortilla still soft.The burritos here are good, actually better than average, but because the tortas here are the showcase, everything else takes a backseat.  The rice and beans are hit and miss, especially at the Chandler location.I used to give TEG four and a half stars, but with the mistake of expanding too quickly, combined with quality and consistency falling a bit, I would have to give them three and half stars; four stars would be stretching. I'm anal so three and three quarter seems to fit.For example, the Phoenix location, which the Son runs and where he started the chain has a few issues.  For example, the Cochinita at the Phoenix location is always drier and saltier than the other two locations.  In addition, they have certain items only at that location that the other two do not.  One would be their Sonoran style hotdogs, which are excellent and an item I would highly recommend.  When I have gone to both the Mesa and Chandler location and asked for them, and unfortunately they said they don't carry them.  I was disappointed to say the least. Another example of inconsistency is the last time I went to the Chandler location.  I brought a couple of out of town guests, and I was a little disappointed because the bread was a little too bready (dense) and not light and fluffy as usual.  When all the ingredients are in perfect symphony, you have one amazing torta, but when one ingredient is off such as something like the bread being too dense throws off that harmonious balance of flavors and textures.  In this case, it made a difference from a four and half star sandwich to a 3 star sandwich (which is still good in my book, but not great).The best and most consistent is their Mesa location.  I think that it is because Mom and Pops run that particular location (well they used to anyways).  Everything has always been consistently delici-oh-so-good.Overall, would I still recommend Tortas El Guero, and do I still go?  Yes, but I wouldn't rave about the place like I once did especially with the inconsistencies I've experienced as of late.FYI. Chandler is the only one with a drive-thru.
other Cevapi and Burek oh my!! Plus I got to hang with my fabulous friend Amra! Score! We wanted something extra good to eat after finishing our Mud Factor race on Saturday and lord knows I have been craving some Cevapi so off we went to Euro Bakery. It was already bookmarked as a place I wanted to try so this was a win, win in my book. Everything is made fresh to order and once you walk in, you can smell the fresh baked bread that they have made throughout the day. There is also a mini grocery store for you to buy items as well.  My Cevapi (little beef sausages with fresh bread, onions and a  sour cream like dip) came out piping hot and piled high. My friends Burek was huge (hmm not sure hot to explain so you will have to look that one up) and we both dived in like it was the last meals we would ever have.Will I come back? Hmm heck yes, but alas this treat can only be saved for when I burn off and absurd amount of calories so that I can indulge and not feel guilty at all.  Hmm Cevapi and Burek = one VERY happy woman!
3 The ever evolving menu changes again, But a coupon made it a decent buy.I will admit my co workers other for other coupon is why we went in. This means ~3.2other per burrito vs the usual $6 range.What I didn't like was that my vegetarian burrito did not have vegetables in it, it was just a bean and rice burrito with guacamole. I don't know how one gets the grilled veggies in their burrito but it is not by ordering a vegetarian burrito.The drink and napkin station here has always been a bottleneck, getting a refill or more napkins is nearly impossible.I do like the fact there there is Choula sauce in addition to the red and green tobascos. And I also like that the chairs are not nearly as bad as those at chipotle.The best tip this time is get in before 12, otherwise be prepared for a long long line.
other The service was excellent and the location was great in Old Scottsdale.  For the price, I was shocked at the small portions of food, although nicely presented.  I'm not a big eater, but after we ate an over-priced dinner, appetizer portions, we had to go elsewhere to eat.
other It's about time I write a review for Kona Grill... after all, I've been here more times than I can count and other of these times occurred this week alone!  Kona Grill is a chain which makes me want to give them only 3 stars, but considering their food is quality, they offer a fun atmosphere, and their service is decent... I'm giving other stars instead.As many of the reviews before mine say, happy hour at Kona is great.  From 3 - 7, they offer 1/other off a small menu of appetizers, sushi rolls, pizzas, and drinks.  (They also have a reverse happy hour from 10pm on I think).  I can't speak for the pizzas (I've never tried them), but the potsticker appetizer is great, and so is the sushi.  If I'm not concerned about happy hour prices, I've often ordered other menu items such as seaweed salad, edamame, nigiri, and the seabass entree too.  I've never been disappointed.I usually do not choose Kona as a destination, but if I'm in the area, at the mall, or someone else chooses it, I'm happy going to Kona every now and then.  It's good for what it is - take it or leave it!
other sslowest drive through ever!!!
other We had a great lunch and enjoyed our visit tremendously. Of special note though was the help I got from one of the guys on giving me some directions to Florance via the "adventure  route", It was very nice of him to spend this time with me. Thanks for the great service. If you vist juisit make sure to take time on the patio and enjoy
3 Corporate... Juice... PIMPS!!! I lurve me some corporate pimp juice! I've been a fan of Jamba's juices for quite a few years... but over time, I had forgotten about the joys of Jamba until my sister (Reylynne W.) We went and I got something with oranges and strawberries in it... i unno what it had... but damnit it was good! :) Nice, clean and fresh, I loved every thick sip. :)
other I live in LA where these shops are on every corner.  I can say without a doubt, this is the best FroYo I've had!On top of that, the store staff is super-friendly and the place is immaculately clean.  They are also serving gelato, pastries and fresh coffee/espresso.  Check it out!
other Eating in is a decent experience, but for delivery, I have yet to meet their match.  When I order delivery I always get a 16" chicken pizza with alfredo sauce on top, and for the last 6 years I have received it in 30 minutes or less all but other times.  Its always tasty, fresh, and is my preeminent food for delivery, ever, period.
other The chicken shawarma is stellar. I get it to go at least once a month, substituting veggies for the rice. Slightly pricey, but you get a lot of food and it's very consistent.
other I am a big fan of this place, either to stop in on a slow Sunday just to see what they have.  Their stock rotates pretty frquently so always new interesting things to find.  So far I've bought a vintage print, an awesome dress that I have received tons of compliments on, cool earrings, and some other kitchen items.  The staff are always friendly.  When you go, make sure you check out the Burt Reynolds beefcake poster they have behind the counter.Great strore!
other I adore RA!  They have a great selection of sushi.  Go for Happy Hour.  Its only a couple of hours, but you really get some great items for pretty cheap.  You can even get a large Asahi for about $5!
other Warning, don't get deterred that there aren't any seats for you when you walk in... that's a good sign that the the tables are full with everyone stuffing their faces.  I waited for about 1other minutes for a table to free up, and I'm glad I did.  It was kind of a chilly night and I was feeling for something hot.  I decided on the seafood noodle soup and pork pies.  The noodles soup broth was lightly seasoned with a hint of white pepper (just the way I like it), the noodles were thick and hearty, and the portion was substantial.  The pork pies (3) were like a flattened pot sticker that had been pan-fried on both sides, Yum!Definitely, a place serving up genuine Chinese food with the finesse of a home-cooked meal. I can't wait to go back!
3 Wanted some mexican that wasn't taco bell. The hotel recommend this place. The restaurant smelled like the inside of a tomato sauce can. I was turned off almost immediately. I decided to sit on the patio and try it out anyway.I ordered the Chipotle BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad with a light cilantro lime dressing. It was okay. The chips and salsa were okay too, nothing to brag about. The salsa tasted like it came from a can. I'm happy I ordered a salad. The redeeming factors were the Arizona Sunset Margarita and the good service. I think once restaurants turn into chains, they seem to lose their original character.
other Great city atmosphere with lots of bright open windows looking out at Central Avenue.  Nice place to relax as the world rushes by outside.  Comfortable seating areas and great beverage assortment.  Danielle Librera's baked goods are the stars here as far as i'm concerned, i went in at 7 am one morning and was delighted to see the entire front counter filled with her creations (scones, muffins, fruit tarts, quiche, cookies and still warm from the oven coffeecake).  It was like a bakery buffet, danielle is right there baking away behind a corner of the counter on most mornings.  I often go to Lola in the evenings (they close at 7 most nights, so sad) and by that time of day there are only a few cookies left, so obviously the regulars are tuned into the best time of day to get the baked goodies.  A guy in front of me on my 7 am visit scooped up half a warm coffeecake to deliver home to some lucky partner/roommate.  The morning we visited, the 7-8 am hour was peaceful and calm, a great waking up time.  It was nice to see an assortment of dads and their young 5-7 year old sons come thru the door and spend time hanging out together at the start of the day.  At 8 am the business commuter crowd started arriving in full force and the place got a whole lot more buzz from all of the conversations going on.  Great location approx 1/other block south of the Central/Camelback light rail stop.  Definitely worth a visit!
other I couldn't find anything to add to the previous review except I have never had a bad experience here no matter who did my nails. They are reasonably priced, friendly and one of the few nail salons I have been to that seem genuinely interested in the customer returning. The owners are friendly and the selection of acrylic colors offered is excellent. If your a magazine reader you might want to bring your own as they only have people and entertainment mags, however I've only had to wait once in nearly a year.
other I'm so in love with this place :) I tried the pepperoni pizza and I was AMAZED. i love that they have a fresh herb/vegetable garden in the front.  It's all about the FRESH ingredients these days.  I can't wait to go back and try different dishes. I'd like to try the cheese platters :) mouth watering as we speak.  going again to day so I'll keep adding to this review. STAY TUNED! BTW, the decor reminds me of the VIG but definitely more spacious dining area.
other My boyfriend and I looked up this place on yelp and decided to try it out.  When we arrived, we walked inside and the line was to the door.  Instead of waiting, we went to the take-out window outside, which we thought was very convienent.  They were very fast and friendly.  The ribs were tender and very good.  The pulled pork and hot sausage had great flavor!  Their bbq sauce is sweet with a bit of tang.  The mac and cheese was EXCELLENT!  The only thing that I was not pleased with was the cornbread.  I feel that they could make it much better.  We will definately be going back to eat bbq.  Overall experience was very good.
other I think I'm in love. If I only lived closer to Downtown Phoenix, I'd leave my mark on the Lost Leaf in the form of a permanent intaglio of my ass cheeks on a bar stool. It's tucked away on a side street in a humble looking home cum art gallery cum bar. It can be a little tricky to find since no sign exists, so keep an eye out for the neon lit open sign. You definitely don't want to miss out on this place by becoming frustrated after fruitlessly ducking down side streets, saying fuck it and going to The Roosevelt. While it wouldn't be a total bust, you'd be missing out on the warm and inviting ambiance of the Lost Leaf.That's really what won me over about this bar. It made me feel downright cozy, with exposed brick and wood, local artist's artwork decorating the walls, and the actual kitchen serving as the bar. The main room is large enough to host a large group, but small enough to be homey. The acoustics are very good (soft talkers rejoice!) and the music playing was loud enough to add to the mood, but nowhere near the point of drowning out conversation. There are a couple rooms in addition to the main bar area that you can duck off into for more intimate conversation, as well as an outdoor patio that's a little on the small side but, super score--there's ceiling fans!I found the prices to be very reasonable and the service to be unpretentious and helpful. There are no beers on tap here, but the selection of bottles is mind bogglingly extensive. I had to ask the bartender to get me his favorite pale beer and I ended up finding out that I am also in love with a brew called 1664. Looks like a wine cooler, but manages to be respectable instead of laughable.So bring a couple friends with you and indulge one night, and then another, and another. You'll be love struck too.
other Five Guys is great for those days when you want to spend $1other on a glorified fast-food hamburger. The meat comes in a wafer-thin patty, and doesn't really taste like anything, just like at Wendy's. The bun tastes mass-produced. I also don't especially care for their fries, although this is a matter of taste more than anything. I'm not generally one for mushy, thick, "natural" fries of the sort served here. I can't help but wonder if people rate this place purely on the quantity of food that you get. The normal size for the burger is a double-patty, and the fries come overflowing from a 1other oz. drink cup. I would rank the burger places around mill as:1) Smashburger, for their delicious Arizona burger, and the awesome smash fries2) Chuckbox, for delicious char-grilled meat that actually tastes like meat3) In-n-out, for great-tasting meat and some of my favorite fries4) Five Guys,5) Fatburger, seriously why the fuck does anyone eat at Fatburger?
3 Ok here goes.  I'll start with the bad and finish positive.  As far as Pizza goes, which is what we went for, I was not that impressed.  I must say I'm more of a NY style, by the slice pizza kind of guy.  So the pizza did not hit the spot.  Maybe a little too fancy for my palette. (You can take a boy out of the ghetto, but you can't take the ghetto out of the boy, so for me simple food is always better.)  Obviously, there are enough people who like gourmet pizza as this place has amazing reviews, so I'm just one simple man.The obnoxious fat chick sitting right behind me proclaimed to her friend, "I'm no longer investing time in men who aren't available!"  Put down the pizza and grab a dry salad and shut up!!  That's not really the restaurants fault though but I did have to endure that convo through the duration of my meal.Our server was very nice however seemed very rushed and at times we had to wait for refills on water and for the check.  The atmosphere is very romantic outside with light trees and live music.  They even turned on one of the heaters on the patio for the lil lady.  We has the Crepe with Nutella chocolate powdered sugar and ice cream and it was very very good.  Bottom line.  I'd be willing to come here again and try something other than pizza.
other whole foods whole paycheck wholly sh$t i am sorry there prices are rediculous the only reason i went there is because since moving here from a very foody town certain products are nearly impossible to find and they do have them but you will pay, my search today was mushroms not button but chantrel/oyster/ect i was going to get every thing on my list but when i saw shallots at 4.9other a lb i bought my shrooms and split the i hit frys, shallots 2.49 a lb and of course theres always trader joes
other Simple but really great cajun food prepared in steamers right in front of you.  Selections include gumbo, pan roasts (a tomato-based broth with chunks of seafood), or seafood creole all with your choice of shrimp, crab, chicken, crawfish, oysters, or all five, with rice. They also have fresh oysters, jumbo shrimp cocktails, salads, and tasty seafood chowder, as well as the occasional lobster special. I've been probably 20 times and still never had a bad dish. The staff is friendly and helpful, and will adjust the spiciness of the dishes to your taste. By far the best option at the Talking Stick resort.As another reviewer noted, this restaurant is really just a bar with a couple of tables, stuck right off the casino floor. This is definitely not a fine dining spot, with the clanging of slot machines and dead-eyed gamblers shuffling around fifteen feet away. Still, it's definitely worth a visit to Talking Stick. At $10-1other for lunch portions and $17-19 for huge dinner servings, and $2other for a massive platter of oysters, shrimp, crab, mussels, and clams, it's a fantastic value for the quality and tastiness of the food.  Good, reasonably priced seafood can be hard to come by in the valley, but this spot is a gem.
other I liked this place... because it's a local owned place with delicious greasy food. This place was written up in the East Valley Trib in one of their "other to try" pieces, which is where I first heard about it. But, I actually think it's funnier that I have been in "Hall of Fame", a store located direclty next door several times and never given Giant Hamburgers a second glance. You walk into this place, past a grouping of tables and booths (only about 1other tables in the entire place)  to the cash register where you order your meal. We each got a burger and fries and they were both great, a real gut-bomb, but sometimes you're in the mood for something that fits just that description. We sat and ate, and they came to bus our table for us. On the way out, we noticed the "Yelp" sticker on the door. Bonus points.
other I'm tired of trekking to the east valley for Lee's Sandwiches.Thao's hit the spot. The marinade for their grilled pork is excellent, very flavorful. I was surprised to see that they are a full service restaurant, offering pho and a variety of plated meals too.
other I love the story time program here! I started coming this summer after having a baby and wanting to get my toddler out of the house while beating the heat. The staff here is amazing! It is a 30 minute session of singing, dancing, stories and bubbles. We look forward to this every week now. My daughter loves the take home cut out and coloring sheet. The first thing she does is come home and color it. I am so thankful for this free program.
other Impressive!   I dined at House of Tricks last week based on the Yelp reviews and was not disappointed.    The aromas from other's food while sitting around at bar let me know I was in for a good meal.   I had trouble deciding what to eat, so I ordered 3 appetizers:   Seafood Stuffed Poblano Pepper, Veal other ways, and Braized Oxtail.    The bartender did a fantastic job of recommending the order in which i received my food - lightest to heaviest.The "Veal other Ways" and "Braised Oxtail" were phenomenal.... a great combination of flavors and texture.   I think I'd put them both in my list of Top 10 dishes.   I can't wait to travel back to Phoenix to eat there again.    I'll also add the I really like the atmosphere.   Very chill place, but elegant without being stuffy.
other This is one of the best Asian meals you may ever eat. They are amazingly inexpensive for lunch too. The house fried rice and the wonton soup are perfection. The Lincoln location is prettier but the food is the same.
other The food here is amazing! So full of flavor, not fat. Healthy, and delicious!  Prices in the 10 range for a salad, and 20 range for an entree'.  The resturant is very loud, because they are always busy. The chairs are too small for my hips, making it uncomfortable to stay very long.  Oh well. I suppose they expect, if you eat here, you must be a size 6.
other I had never been to Dominick's and I like trying new restaurants so I was excited to check it out.  We had a reservation for 8 pm on Saturday night and when we showed up the restaurant was busy.  It definitely is catering to those that want to be seen and show off what they have.  As we were walking up they had 6-7 of your finest vehicles backed in right next to the front door.Calling it a front door is a little misleading however.  I found it interesting for such a nice restaurant to have a revolving door as there entrance.  Once inside the door you are greeted by what is a darkened "Liberace" type decor.  Think big chandeliers and crushed velvet.  We were seated promptly for our 8 pm reservation.Top line the food was mediocre.  We between the other of us we ordered the  Scallops, Halibut, and the Ribeye as our entrees.  For our sides we ordered the potatoes, gnocchi, and creamed corn as our sides.  The main issue that we all had with the food was that it was very salty.  At one point my buddy across the table asked me " does yours taste really salty?". I answered yes and everybody else chimed in that theirs was quite salty as well.  I don't know if the chef was having a bad night but if not he needs to pump the brakes on his salt usage!Finally this place isn't the cheapest place.  I am not one to complain about prices and I eat at fine dining restaurants on a weekly basis as part of my job.  Our bill for the other of us was $500.  We did have a couple drinks a piece but the price we paid did not match the quality of food we received.My advice is to check out the bar for a few drinks and enjoy the people watching.  Think Phoenix Open.  Otherwise if you are looking for a good steakhouse head across the street to Ocean Club.
other Jason Silberschlag pulls off a pretty amazing thing here in the metro-PHX area.  Three shops with their own quirky details, passion and identity.  Each tailors specifically to the demographic at hand, which I can totally get behind.  The fact that each shop has its own deal going on is awesome - I really dislike chains and the chain feel/look.  I hadn't seen Jason in a while at the other shops, the times I'd frequented, and was happy to see him behind the bar when I came here for the first time.Just the same way the other Cartel shops have a selection of brewing methods, this one does as well.  Pour-over, aeropress, Chemex and traditional espresso (La Marz GS/3).As expected from him, our drinks were flawless.  He transfers this knowledge and passion to the baristas, which is obvious even when one leaves his establishment to go somewhere else - they stand out in the crowd of many coffee-pullers.  The beans, who can complain?  Jason made his name with the roasting.I got a prepared sandwich here, and my was it tasty.  Bread was fresh.  Sauce, ingredients and overall creation was good.  Big Ben: you stole my tastebuds' heart that morning.Casual lounge area (see: couches), outdoor covered seating (see: hallway - shaded and cool!) and plenty of seating inside.  As normal, his handiwork shines throughout the shop.  Somehow I've never reviewed a Cartel shop before, despite my years of patronage.  My latest experience changes that.
other Sadly disappointed.  I've passed Lola's an uncountable number of times and each time thought I needed to try it.  I finally did tonight and was terribly disappointed.  For anyone that has been to Firefly in Las Vegas there is just no comparison.  The sangria was decent but nothing special and the tapas were just "so so."  The atmosphere was busy and our service sucked, but it was a very unique and cool environment.
other Great location and within walking distance to Scottsdale and old Scottsdale.  Really well maintained and bed / pillow were the most comfy ever!  We typically stayed at another resort but this was a great substitute. They allow pets in many rooms so request a non-pet room if you wish.
other They do a great job! My old dry cleaner was always destroying buttons on my shirts. Never happens at Titan. Friendly staff, too. Also, good place to have alterations & shoe repairs next door...in the back of a barber shop.
other LOVE Five Guys!
other Surprisingly nice arean, given that the fans in Phoenix apparently hate hockey...  It's got a lovely outdoor area with shopping and restaurants, convenient and close free parking, and a large selection of food and beverage options inside.  When we went, the stadium was pretty much empty...which is fairly normal, as I understand it.  Still, if there was more interest, the place could hold a large number of people and has the potential to be a great venue for Arizona hockey.
other We were greeted with very friendly staff.  We had the fried knocci for an appetizer with a fabulous marinara sauce - usually do not order knocci but these came recommended and were very good.  The bread was crusty on the outside & chewy on the inside -very yummy.  We sat at the bar as we usually do and the bartender brought over a sample of their meet sauce to try with more bread.  I don't eat meat sauce but my husband said it was very good.  I had a heft cosmo & my husband had a beer.  For dinner i had the pasta trio that was fabulous - probably the best italian food i've had since the cioppino at Allesia's restaurant.  My husband had the linguine with white clam sauce also very good.  I'm certain these pasta dishes were homemade because they just had amazing flavor - I wanted more!! We finished with tiramisu that was also really great.  My husband had coffee and even that was great.  A little pricey in my opinion for italian food but due to how great all of it tasted -  we think it was worth it.  This will be a definite dining destination in the future.
other This would most certainly be "my" coffee shop if I hadn't already established myself as a regular at another local shop. This brand-new, independent coffee shop has spent the money to look really nice (it even has a fountain inside!).But what money can't buy is community and unfortunately this shop doesn't seem to have much of that. Granted, building community takes time and/or energy. For their sake, I really really hope it works out in the long-run.
other Lee Lee's finally expanded from their Chandler location for us who have loyally driven an hour to shop. Low prices, huge selection, and it only took like a week for the place to smell like a true Asian market (i.e., wherever you are, you will never escape the smell of fish).I love it. I bought ingredients for Vietnamese spring rolls, two different kinds of curries, a new motor/pestle, a Vietnamese coffee press, and some various other vegetables and liquors... hardly anything. Also, the seafood, while I didn't purchase any, looks very fresh.Wonderful to see such a great addition to west Phoenix.
other I went here Saturday night with a party of 4.  It is a pretty neat place in a neat area.  I felt pretty hip and urban being there.  Anyway, I NEVER eat pasta because I "try" to stay away from those carbs, so even coming here was a giant step for me.  I wasn't expecting the pasta here to be anything great but boy was I wrong.  Each one that I tried was excellent.  The ingredients tasted fresh and delicious and each was very flavorful.  I don't remember exactly which ones I tried (I tried other of them), but each one was excellent.  They probably don't make a bad pasta dish.Some of the dishes have some odd/random ingredients, but don't let that scare you.  Order each dish as it is listed on the menu and you won't be disappointed. When I feel like I have to get carbed up for a big race I will return!I'm still a little pissed that they didn't have diet coke or any diet soda at all for that matter.  Who doesn't have diet soda?  I get that they are trying to be green, local, natural, organic or whatever else is hip right now but come on.  I know I should probably stick to water anyway, but I always enjoy a diet coke with any good meal.  I'm not sure why, but I just love it and it makes my meal a lot more enjoyable.  Weird, I know.
other Let me start by saying I have never had BBQ I didn't like. I've had BBQ I could do without, but never that I didn't like. Went in for lunch today and I was the only customer, so I figured cool I will get good service no matter what. The girl sat me and was very pleasant and indicated my waitress would be right over. About ten minutes later, watching the waitress talk on a personal phone call at the bar the whole time, the girl who sat me came over to take the order. She walked up, didn't say a word, and just stared at me. Ok I can live with that it was only a minor inconviencence. Got the #other lunch chopped pork sandwich with beans and a lemonade and it came out very quickly. Possibly because the beans were Bush's or the like? They tasted like canned baked beans heated up in a microwave. Not cool. The sandwich was ok at best. Thinking back on Stacy's, Honey Bear's, and other great BBQ spots, this one was not even in the same arena. I'll have to go back though and try a sandwich with the correct sauce on it. There was one sauce on the table which after reading reviews here I had assumed was the BBQ sauce. It looked a little watery but I thought whatever its NC style, and it may have been because it was a bit vinegary. On the way out I noticed every other table had a red sauce labeled BBQ, so I guess they have two different ones. I would have preferred the red one I assume. There was no atmosphere, the place was run down (doesn't appear to have been remodeled after Shish Kabob House vacated) and was generally a dirty feeling place. Seeing as they didn't have any customers at lunch time, I'm assuming the place is going to lose money today. Don't know about other days, but they better get their act together quick or it is going to fail.
other Get the White Chocolate but leave the Strawberries and Cream flavor, too faux-berry/chemical tasting.
other Indulge Burgers got a few things right and a few things wrong, but overall, I was very pleased with my experience. We had a Living Social deal, and got the sweet potato and regular fries combo, as well as a side salad to start. The fries were good, but nothing special. The salad made me want to cry. I know you don't go to a burger joint to get a salad, but couldn't you at least try to make it a decent salad? It was all white lettuce and a few sprigs of sliced carrots. My husband wanted me to give the place 3 stars for the lettuce alone. But, the burgers themselves were good, and the Build-Your-Own was a really good deal. There is good variety on the toppings, cheese, sauces and buns to choose from. My turkey patty was huge - it was overflowing out of the English muffin. Some plusses: the service was really, really excellent. One of the best servers I've ever had. Also, while we were waiting for our table, the owner/manager came around and offered everyone samples of margarita. Since I'm pregnant and couldn't try the sample, he said I got a free milkshake. After we were seated and he was walking around, he made sure our server knew that he had offered a free milkshake and made good on the promise! That was so cool. I left totally stuffed and very satisfied.
other Love this place, food is very well portioned, and yummy.  I really love the endless selection of bottled drinks offered.  Must try if your craving a soda different from the normal selections offered.  But, they do have the standby soda selections available as well.  Stop in, burgers have some crazy combinations to try.
other I was in Phoenix for three weeks on a business trip and luckily found this spot on my 3rd day in town.  I ended up eating here 7 times in 2other days.  I brought my coworkers here, and they all ended up eating here at least 2-3 times.  It's just that good.So how good is it?  Lets just say that their tortilla soup was the only thing that could cure my horrible hangover after a long night in Scottsdale!I've eaten the fish tacos, fajitas, enchiladas, nachos, and tortilla soup.  All were exceptional!  They also bring out chips with salsa, as well as beans, which was a nice touch.The dining area is fairly small, but they do have an outside dining area as well.  The wait staff is very friendly, and they will get you drinks as soon as you sit down, which is something that more restaurants should do!  The food comes out very quickly, and they do have other TVs, one on either side of the dining room, which are usually tuned to a sporting event.I've been out of Phoenix for 3 months now and I miss Mi Pueblo!  I'll definitely be going back the next time that I'm in Phoenix!
other A great family owned restaurant! Their lunch specials are very reasonable. I recommend this place to anyone looking for good Japanese food. My only request is that they open a restaurant closer to Tempe - I would go so much more often.
other Thank goodness for Sue at Mill Avenue Travel. We contacted Sue to book our honeymoon trip to St. Lucia at one of the Sandals resort.  She was great with setting everything up, booking airfare etc.  When our original airfare decided to cancel the flight, she made sure we had a comparable one booked.  The best thing she did for us was encourage us to purchase travel insurance.  When we arrived at our Miami hotel at 10:30pm the night prior to leaving for St. Lucia, we had discovered Sue had left us an urgent note to contact her.  We found out a hurricane had hit St. Lucia and all of a sudden our honeymoon plans starting crumbling apart.  Because of Sue and our travel insurance (thank goodness we listened to the expert on this one!), we were able to change our honeymoon to a Sandals resort in the Bahamas and didn't miss a beat.  Sue was in constant contact with us, which calmed the craziness I was feeling (and I'm sure my new husband was relieved).  The airlines even took care of our baggage fees on the way to the Bahamas.  If we had booked this trip on our own, we would have been up a creek without a paddle.  I most definitely would not have purchased travel insurance and our honeymoon would not have turned out to be the amazing trip it was. We will definitely be using Sue again.
3 Visited recently for the first time.  Enjoyed happy hour appetizers on the patio.  Cool place for outdoor dining, the waterfall added a nice background.  They offer smoking and non-smoking on separate sides of the patio.  Of course you know that if anyone is smoking, the entire area gets to "enjoy" the smoke.  Being a non-smoker, I would appreciate an true non-smoking area but being outdoors was too compelling to pass on this beautiful day.  Another small observation - the tables were too low for the chairs causing you to lean over to eat and the chairs were not comfortable at all.  We ordered chicken quesadilla & crab cake appetizer.  The quesadilla was made w/ green chiles and cheese, served w/ green & red salsa.  Didn't care for the red salsa but the green was pretty good, rather mild.  A side of sour cream was all that was missing here.  Crab cakes were ok, nothing special.  Served w/ a nice side salad it made a very good small meal.  A side of some kind of orange sauce (chipotle?) for the crab cakes that seemed really HOT to me - skip this next time please.Just based on the outdoor atmosphere alone, I would definitely come back again.
3 The Phoenix Hooters is directly opposite the Sheraton Downtown hotel where I was staying. Was really hungry and didn't want to eat at the hotel so decided to give hooters a try. Hooters girls are always a nice touch. I really liked this location since there was a lot of outside seating. The food is what you expect from Hooters. I had the pulled pork sandwich with fries. It was good but then I was very hungry. Food quality was good and arrived quickly. Can't ask for anything more!! Hooters girl was also cute!! I would come back with a crowed of guy for a drink and burger. Prices are very reasonable.
3 I was hoping for a more adult friendly place. I haven't been here in years, it used to be a gay-friendly hotspot. Now it seems to caters more to families and children. I've heard the restaurant is good, but I haven't visited yet.
other Efficient friendly service and good fresh-squeezed juice. I rarely eat breakfast food but I enjoyed their New Mexico skillet.
3 I like it better then Denny's so I stop on by to get some breakfast. It's okay not the best place in the world but if your having a hard time picking between after hours with Dennys and Waffle house I would pick waffle house for sure.
other I rarely give other stars, as I believe it is very difficult to obtain a perfect score through food, beverage, service, ambiance, etc. Christopher's new venture is perfectly Christopher, other stars.First off a little background, Christopher is a native. That's right; he's a graduate of Central High School. He studied in France where he honed his craft and to this day draws his technique from. He has owned now three ventures in Phoenix, first his fine dining and bistro location on the northwest corner of 24st and Camelback (later became Eddie's by Eddie Matney, former hair dresser turned chef at Cous-Cous then Eddie's Grill) then after closing he moved to the restaurant row in The Biltmore Fashion Park, 2rd level to open Christopher's Fermier Brasserie & Paola's Wine Bar. Which in reading many reviews here on Yelp was unfortunately misunderstood. It makes me wonder if people understand what French is, it's not their fault though, there aren't many French restaurants in town, most have be closed, including Mary Elaine's at the Phoenician  and John Claude's Petite Cafe. There are a few that still survive Sophie's and Vincent's, but in this town of chains few people venture for French. Now with Christopher's Restaurant/Crush Lounge he has passed on the wine bar and opened a lounge instead. Christopher does enjoy lounges as he is a regular at Merc Bar, but then so is his smoked salmon which is offered on the Merc Bar menu. So a lounge makes sense, I'm a believer in a chef should open what they are passionate about. The new location has a different feel from his previous; his last venture echoed a French Countryside feel, as did the food. I think that was why many didn't understand it; yes it was French, but ALL FRENCH IS NOT FINE DINNING. I wish more understood that concept, but this is primarily a beer drinking state, not wine or rather more Mc D's not Mary E's! Hence there's a difference between filling your stomach and filling your soul and leaving a restaurant inspired with the feeling that life is wonderful. Christopher's is the latter. The design is contemporary with long lines of brushed stainless, white linen and exposed wooden beams. Kudos to whoever designed it, great job! The tables are dressed with white linen, elegant silver and polished stemware. You can't help but feel that it's 'time to dine' when seated. The walls in the main dining room have many vases of fresh flowers that seem to be replaced whenever necessary, nice touch.  The food at Christopher's is exactly what you'd expect, French, without the super-high-end prices. He's still one of the only chefs in town serving Foie Grass and Duck Confite, both wonderful and worth the trip if a glass of juice (wine) is added! I've been there now on other occasions and everything is fantastic, flavorful and prepared professionally. Christopher offers daily specials and I recommend them including; Veal Chop on Wednesdays, Roasted Duck on Thursday, Lamb Shank on Friday and Rabbit on Saturday. But don't stop at your entree, get the cheese course for dessert or for something sweet, the Chocolate Tower is one of the best desserts in town, hands down, no question.  Service is another point were Christopher sets himself apart. It doesn't get any better than this. Again it's NOT fine dining, so you can't compare it to fine dining restaurants (but then again there's only one left in the valley - Different Point Of View).  The servers know the food; they can describe anything on the menu and recite the specials as if their job depends on it (if you know Christopher it probably is).  Food is coursed correctly with a few minutes in between, as well as wine service is as professional as it gets. The bread service is as always, French breads with a super rich, euro butter, perfect for lapping up to sauce or vinaigrette remains on your plate.Needless to say, Christopher does it right, in my opinion, or is it just my opinion? Many of the valley's most celebrated chefs eat at Christopher's, he's know in many circles as the "chef's chef". But don't take my word for it, ask the chef at your favorite restaurant, who their favorite chefs are in town, and favorite restaurants, most likely Christopher will make the list!Here's the web address:  http://www.christophersaz.com/The website is limited; menu, wine list, press release and pictures of the restaurant...
other I have been here a couple times now, so I thought I should review it. The ticket prices are a bit higher than other theaters, but the drinks are cheaper....a wash I guess. I saw the Mechanic there this week and had an overall pleasant experience. Usually I hate going to the movies because of all the sick people coughing on my head but this time the theater was relatively empty and I had a blast. The sound system in the theater we were in was great. Clear and crisp. The movie quality was also good. The concession stand was quick, in and out with my food and drinks. Yep, definitely one of the better theaters in the valley.
other Ride the bulls gals and put on a show :) Just wear pants, please!! Fun spot to get drunk and do kinky things with cotton candy! Great happy hour specials!Extremely generous bartenders and huge portions of food. Well worth the money!!
other I was searching for a unique item to give as a Thank You gift and I stopped by Practical Art over the Labor Day weekend after viewing some items on their website.  I was extremely under underwhelmed by the service I received and do not plan on returning.  When I arrived the young woman behind the counter was having a personal conversation with an acquaintance.  Besides the employee and her conversation buddy the store was empty.  I spent about ten minutes looking around and the young woman did not have the common courtesy to acknowledge me with a simple "Hello", even as I was viewing items directly in front of the counter.  When I was leaving the store she did break long enough to say "Bye".I believe it is very important to support local business but I will not spend my money here.  I did find several items I wanted to buy and made note of the artist. I have done the extra leg work to reach out to them to find out how to purchase their items through other channels.  I do not feel they should miss a sale due to the sub par customer service at this location.
other Sprouts is my favorite market to shop at! They are a great company who have a very friendly staff in their stores as well as their corporate office. They are also very involved with the community and with local farmers and businesses!The prices for all the fresh and natural groceries they carry are the most reasonable out of all the grocery stores I have been too! The Vitamin Department has everything you could ever look for to help your well being and they are always extravaganzas in the stores so you are always getting the most out of your money, and in times like these I know people are very appreciative of that since groceries are becoming more and more expensive everyday, or so it seems!I most definitely recommend anyone to shop at Sprouts!
other It's a good concept if the owners / mismanagement had bothered to keep a trendy or classy atmosphere. As it is save your money get fast food - McDonald's has less grease. We had to ask for plates for the appetizer platter (it is meant to be shared) so the sever handed my daughter other paper plates. My salad wasn't a salad it was a paper plate of mixed greens - really no tomatoes, nothing on it or in it other than lettuce and she threw a packet of Newmans Dressing on the table just like the ones you get at Burger King or McDonald's. My steak - it was OK - I asked for medium and got medium well and that was the best part of it. The steak is served on a paper plate and when I asked about utensils I was directed to go get my own from around the corner - yup plastic ware for a steak on a paper plate.My daughter had a burger and it was so greasy the bun turned soggy brown part way through then fell completely apart.Service? Well let's just pretend this place is 100% do it yourself then it would be OK. The waitress walked away before my daughter finished her order. Never came back and asked how things were, nothing. Really if we were the kind to dine & dash it wouldn't have been a problem because she wouldn't have known we were gone. My daughter actually had to go find the server and ask for the bill!!!!What kills me is the employees exude an I don't care attitude which is also obvious in their actions (or lack of actions) and the message I got was the owner / mis-management has accepted this lazy unfriendly service because it's obvious by how poorly the place is run that it's OK with them.It could be great but they would need to make a lot of changes - job other fire everyone & start over. If I could have given them 1/other a star I would have - we won't be going back.
3 After living other blocks away for over a year, i finally took the jump and decided to deal with the long wait to try this place out.  Got there at 7:30 on a Tuesday night... 2.other hour wait.  (To be expected, but still pretty ridiculous.)  Went next door to Bar Bianco, ordered a bottle of wine and patiently waited outside.  I think that the wait is part of the allure for people.  Also, after waiting hungry for 3 hours, the food becomes tastier because you are starving.  Finally get a table at 10:15.  Order the caprese salad and another bottle of wine.  The ingredients are very fresh.  The Mozz is excellent, the tomatoes are very very fresh and tasty and the basil was great as well.  The server didnt make any recommendations on wine or food.  A bit odd.  Given that the wait is 3 hours and that it's pricy for a pizza joint, you'd think that the service would be excellent.  Not at all the case.  This guy acts like everyone here is a regular.  The reality is that with 3 hour waits for a table, i don't have time to be a regular at this place. We ordered other pizzas to try.... Biancoverde and Wiseguy.  They were pretty good, again with good ingredients.  I wouldn't say it was the best pizza i've ever had, but very tasty.  Asked for some Balsamic to go with the Mozz and Tomatoes... had to ask the server other times, finally we snagged a food runner, she got it for us.  I shouldnt have to ask for something 3 times. I mean really, this place only has like 6 tables... pay attention to the guests.  I guess the moral here is that trying this place is all about the experience and saying that you've been there.  While Bianco is good you can go to Parlor or Cibo and get very good (comparable) pizza without a 3 hour wait.  Is it good, yes. Is it worth the wait, nope.
other Lots of cool, cute and educational things here for my two kiddies. I stop in here for each birthday/Christmas to balance out the "junk" toys. I love the art project portfolio that is divided by school year and the school memory books. :)
other Talk about one of the best burgers in town...in fact i think houstons and this place have the best burgers in phoenix!!!! I took one bite and i was in heaven...it was a whole new take on a burger but not too crazy!! I love the fries especially when you mix the sweet potato fries with the regular ones OMG!!!  I like to dip them in ranch but you can select what you want to.dip them in...i have to thank.my sister for this place she introduced me!!! Its a great place to.go for lunch and dinner but it.is not very big so you may have to wait but its worth it!!! Its a fun place do not miss it...
other The manager at this location is a pretentious jerk, he is condescending and immature.  I will never return to this place or recommend it.  The food is delicious, the atmosphere is sophisticated but the crowd is lame and the management is even worse. Spend your evening and your money elsewhere.
other There is nothing quite like Persian food;  it is complex, delicious and sometimes like nothing you've ever tasted.   Apart from dad's kitchen and sit-down places in Tempe and Scottsdale, there are limited places to find it in the Valley.  Do yourself a favor and don't order a gyro;  you can find one anywhere.  Order one of the daily specials at their crazy cheap prices for Persian food and enjoy!  I've had nearly all of them and they rock!  These dishes take all day to make; believe me I know and you can taste why.  And do not miss the saffron ice cream with rose water and pistachios.
other Good pizza. Nice and laid back. Good staff too.
other Pretty damn expensive, but I don't think I could ever get sick of the teppenyaki!
other This place is fantastic - very tasty and a nice surprise for the Tempe area.   Tempe seems to be full of places meant for those in college (makes sense because it is, in fact, a college town) - but for those of us who work in the are this is a nice break from the regular places.  I will be adding this to my list of lunch options. It is really nice when you are looking for a light salad or even quiche.  I would recommend this.
other I have to admit, I normally don't like Chinese food. In fact, it's just about the only style of food I haven't fallen in love with at some point in my life. This is a real problem when you live with someone that would die for Chinese food at all hours of the day/night. I figured out why I never liked Chinese food when I first ate at Asian Cafe Express. It's because everything I've had has been Americanized Chinese Food!!!  It was like an epiphany and seriously music to my tastebuds when I actually found Chinese food I not only liked, I LOVED! Having authentic Chinese food changed my opinion completely about this cuisine.I have to agree with the others... save yourself the time and skip the first few pages. Go straight to the back of the menu to find authentic Hong Kong Style fare. Holy mother of god, everything I've tried has been outstanding and each time I leave saying it was the best meal I've tried thus far. Everything is extremely cheap and the service is superb. The wait staff are always very helpful and knowledgeable about their food. They'll be quick to recommend something if you're having a hard time deciding. Just ask!
3 It was my first visit to Wienerschnitzel and OMG two words CORN DOG! It is better than the ones at the State Fair. I also had the polish dog. I am sorry but Costco's is better. The french fries were OK. The best thing I had was the corn dog.
other My rating is based on the fact that as a vegetarian, they charge $8 for a small mediocre bean burrito.  Maybe if this bean burrito were exceptionally good or large in size, but it was neither.  I'm not saying that if your idea of Mexican food is Chipolte, you will not find what you are looking for and be happy here. But if what you offer your vegetarian customers is deleting the meat and not adding anything else and charging full price, I can get MUCH BETTER elsewhere and pay way less.  GRINGOS:  Take off the Chipolte blindfolds!  Go to a real Mexican restaurant and see what real food is supposed to taste like!
other In a word: Kitsch.This 50's palace of pink serves up a number of ice cream dishes, including favorites such as banana splits and brownie sundaes as well as build your own creations.  The ice cream itself was underwhelming, I was expecting a homemade recipe, but was a little surprised when I saw tubs of Dreyers being brought into the front dining room.Given it's location in Old Town Scottsdale, a venerable dumping ground of knick knacks galore, Sugar Bowl was exactly what I expected in terms of decor and atmosphere, kitsch, kitsch and more kitsch.Where is Gelateria Parmalat when you need it?
other Looking for good Philadelphia street eats? Well, Forefathers Cheesesteaks & Fries is the place for you!While Forefathers' is light on Philadelphia decor like the Liberty Bell, the sandwiches would give fan favorite Philly restaurants like Pat's, Geno's or Jim's a run for their money. And you don't have to be a Cheese Whiz fan. The gooey provolone on my sandwich left my mouth watering. The sweet potato fries were equally good. Be sure to sample the available dipping sauces like ranch, honey mustard, or (my fave) fries sauce.The next time you're in the mood for cholesterol count busting goodness, be sure to check this place out. Even Ben Franklin wouldn't need his bifocal specs to see that Forefathers is worth a fry...oops, I mean, try.
other Best nights to go to Postino's are Mondays and Tuesdays.  They offer $20 deals where you get other slices of bruschetta out of the 1other that they offer and one whole bottle of the house wine.  Each bruschetta slice is probably the size of maybe your hand with your fingers outstretched -- if you're a petite girl  :) ...  They then cut each slice into 4's.  Perfect for sharing!We went on a Monday night after 8PM and ordered other bottles of wine, the other orders of the bruschetta (which were 8 slices for those that can't count), and a bowl of olives.  The total came out to about $50...that's a little over $13/person w/o tip!!  AWESOME!!    PLUS, they have complementary valet parking. Everything was just fantastic, I've never had fig before and they made my experience there quite memorable.  I definitely recommend you come in, regardless if it's for their $20 deals on Mon/Tues or not.  They've got GREAT food and I WILL be back.
3 Cool atmosphere and good service.The food is good but seems they are still working on their recipes. The complimentary bread was cold (a small but important detail) and the "salsa verde" was mediocre. I had the Orange and Fennel Prawns and there was too much orange and barely any fennel. My boyfriend had the Lobster Mac n' Cheese. Said the lobster didn't taste fresh and the sauce was too rich.Ernie, the manager came over and introduced himself. He explained the remodel from the previous concept. We'll definitely come back to support a local place at CityScape. I just hope to see some improvements in the food.
other Always drop by this place when i'm in tempe.  Usually i do not like greek/mediterranean food, but this place is the exception.  They give you pretty large servings of food when you order the dinners.  I always get the lamb and beef plate.  Comes with bread, meat, vegetables and some white cream sauce.  All in all an excellent combination.  Throw in the low prices and you got yourself a winner.
other Found hair in my burger.  While that is not completely horrible, I was put off by another thing I saw in the restaurant.  They had red buckets of Sanitizer sitting on the food preparation counter.  While I like to see a clean restaurant, I don't think keeping a bucket full of cleaners within a couple inches of the food preparation area is wise.  Also the staff was spraying window cleaner on fixtures they were removed for cleaning. This again is a nice thing to see, but not when the overspray was going straight into the food.Maybe a one time bad experience, but it just looked like some serious lack of supervision of the staff.
other I always connect here because I fly US Airways from Las Vegas.  But everytime I have a stop over here, other than a major back track to the Bay Area, I don't really mind coming here because it's a well maintained airport. It might look old but it is always clean. I'm only here about other or other hours at a time but I can't help but notice all these restaurants in here, if you're hungry and don't mind 'airport prices', never fear selection is here.  Also be prepared to walk close to a mile to your connecting flight.  There's LONG hallways here. Don't worry, they have standing walking escalators.
other Last week, I had my first appointment at Pure Dental. Dr. Kang and the office staff were all really nice and helpful. Dr. Kang even did my cleaning and it was very thorough. I've never had the actual dentist give me my cleaning. I was wowed by their modern equipment to view x-rays and the doctor even took pictures of my teeth to show me. I will be going back to get some filings next week and was told I could watch a movie while I was getting them done.
other I really am a fan of this place. It has good food and good beer, and also is associated with some good memories here. This place is a great place to come to and watch a game or two. Or in our case, a great place to come to after watching out team win or lose the game. The parking here can be difficult since there is no lot or anything designated for costumer parking. The beer is really good here. I like the lighter beers, such as their regular peach beer, but their other beers and seasonal are awesome too. The food is delish; I always get a hankering for their beer battered fries. Eat it with their jalapeño ranch sauce and it's perfect. That and some loaded chicken nachos are easily split between friends; their portion sizes are fairly huge. It's really an awesome spot to get together with friend, have a pint, enjoy a game and some good food.
other Yume Sushi Grill is a great spot! All of the sushi is very fresh, and they pride themselves in having great quality. The sushi chefs are knowledgeable in their craft, and also extremely friendly to have a chat with. They serve free salad and miso soup, and the serving staff is friendly, helpful, and attentive.The Korean dishes are pretty authentic, and the home made kimchi is great! I recommend the bulgogi, bi bim bab, and spicy pork for meals. Lunch time is the best time to go, as their lunch specials are amazingly priced for the amount of food that you receive. The one complaint that I have is that they don't stock a few of my favorite kinds of sushi (although I know they aren't the most popular) mackerel, quail eggs, and surf clam won't be found on the menu.
other Taylor's has such a refreshing cafe menu. I've been for breakfast far more often than lunch. I hope to try dinner soon b/c I think they feature live jazz on Wednesday nights. I've never ever had a bad meal. In fact, I always have a hard time deciding. Some highlights in my opinion are the huevos rancheros, eggs Benedict (with a choice of meat), waffles & the Mexican omelet. I never liked Bloody Marys until I had one at Taylor's! I tried a friend's once and have been hooked ever since! But if you want a less intoxicating beverage, try the iced chai latte. Careful, its so good you'll be ordering another before you know it! Bon Appetite!
other Cadillac Ranch looked really awesome from the outside, this nice red cadillac out front, nice patio outside, and an enclosed bar and grill patio on the side. Upon entering it was pretty dead, well, it was a Monday afternoon after all.I ordered the Southwestern Country Fried Steak, huge plate of food that came with your choice of House Salad or Ceaser Salad. I dove into the mashed potatos, which upon their many options of how you want your potatos to taste (garlic, cheese, horshradish, etc), I picked garlic - always go safe at a first time resturaunt! The gravy was very bland, I ended up putting more salt on it. The potatos were the only thing salty and flavored on my plate. They had also put diced garlic in the mix, not roasted, but raw garlic. I love garlic, but I can't eat whole cloves (horrible headaches) like some of those awesome people can out there, so it was kinda a downer there. The two pieces of country fried steak was actually steak, but the very fatty piece of steak that you should never buy, cook, and serve.Since I came with friends and family, it seemed the only thing they could put flavor in was the deep fried dishes. My mother ordered the Fish and Chips, they were slightly on the dark side, the fish wasn't fishy but slightly bland, the cocktail sauce was the only thing that saved the fish from being totally neglected lol. The fries were really good though! My friend had ordered the same thing, I think she wasn't complaining was because she had ordered mamosa's lol.Service-wise, it was slow, but don't expect to be waited on asap on a dead Monday.I think the only thing that tasted good was the Ice Cream Fudge Brownie, but that single dish alone won't help this review get to two stars.All in all, eat at the other different eateries at Tempe Marketplace, I think Cadillac Ranch would be the last resort place if you can't get in to another popular resturaunt at the time.
other Makes the job of shipping packages a lot less miserable.I can purchase any supplies needed, heck--they will even fill out the forms!I come bring all my packages here, ship them whatever method I want and get it all done without stressing.While I hate dealing with shipping things... this place makes it even a bit fun with their service with a smile and fun conversation added in.
other Be sure to see Taylor, her service is great, the food is awesome, had roast beef sandwich ...and a plank of bruschetta!  But without good service the experience lacks. Be sure to try it out.
other Pop the Soda Shop has closed its doors last month.
other There are many other reviews which extol the virtues of this location. I just wanted to add some of my experiences as well as a few observations.First off, at the time of this writing I've been in Phoenix for about a year. Learning about all the necessary places to go in a new town, I had the opportunity to rate businesses objectively (not like 'My mom always went there so I do too...')Fry's became a standard 'go to' place. Their hours are great (other AM to other AM). There are many locations, and their prices are very competitive. They also have a convenient VIP card and electronic coupon program.Specifically to my needs, this location has a good pharmacy, an organic/health selection and a well stocked bakery and deli (for parties and special occasions). Their parking is reasonable and the lot is well kept/secure. There's also a Chase branch nearby as well as a Best Buy, Staples and Old Navy. On Wednesdays there's a Farmer's Market just across the street for everything else I can't find here.Not all Fry's carry the same things. For instance, I can only depend on this location to carry pita bread, garlic naan, large Fage yogurt as well as the Mexican version of creme fraiche. I appreciate this greatly.One word of caution, be firm with the staff at the deli. Take a number, insist on their attention, and don't let them gyp you with small wings or the bottom of the pasta selection. I know some of them don't care about their job, but don't let that ruin your experience. Remember: they're probably making minimum wage.Oh, and the other reviewer's comment about the parking is accurate, although I'm not sure what they can do about it as this is a mall complex.
other I don't quite get it. Am I naive, not part of the "in" crowd or not tipping the right people? Our experience at Masto's started off a little rocky, but wound up being okay. We arrived 1other minutes early for our 6:00 PM reservation Sunday evening, no problem because the place is dead, right? Not so fast! We get taken to the worst table in the farthest corner of the restaurant while passing by 80% of the tables that are empty. Luckily we noticed right away the table would be a good fit for 1other people not a party of two which we were. They graciously reseated us at a small table for two which was much better.Now, after that you may think, why'd this guy give them four stars. Well they redeemed themselves a little later. My partner ordered an ice tea which they were temporarily out of. How does that happen by the way? Out of Ice Tea? But I digress, they wound up bringing him a complimentary Ice Tea once they had brewed a new batch.I guess you probably want to know about the food. I started with the Beefsteak Tomato and Onion appetizer which was excellent, my partner loved his loved his French Onion Soup. We both had the Bone-In Kansas City Strip his was a little undercooked and mine was just perfect. We shared the Au Gratin Potatoes and Creamed Spinach...both were excellent.We'll give it another try sometime when we're in the mood for steak so hopefully we can have a Five-Star experience.
other Oh, YEAH!!! Coming to Scottsdale. I have used RedSeven in Tempe and Mesa and excited to know that they are coming to Scottsdale. I work on the roads throughout the valley and have a lot of customers in Scottsdale that I continue to brag to them about RedSeven's Super Quick Service. Getting the job done quick and right and guaranteed to be the fastest to get you back to work!!!! Oh, and they talk to you so you can understand, not computer talk. Can't wait for Scottsdale!!!!
other I've never had a bad meal at Z-Tejas.  My favorite is the Jerk Chicken Salad, but I've also had some great scallops there.  The cornbread is always delicious, and they're famous for their margaritas.
3 Being the B, L, and D (breakfast, lunch and dinner) restaurant of a major valley resort takes allot of versatility. From scrambling eggs to grilling a piece of meat the new Rico's American Grill at the Point Hilton Squaw Peak Resort shows that all this can be done and more on a daily basis. With two massive patios, a large bar and lounge area coupled with a fantastic selection of locally made beers on tap, just beckons you to try them all out. This is easily done by ordering up a Beer Flight ($7) which gets you other 5oz glasses of their best brews, though this will be tough to chose, they're all good. Then you can order a capped 64oz growler ($20) to go! A growler is simply a large glass jug filled with your favorite beer, your choice. These are all the rage in other cities so I was excited to see Rico's making this offer. Id fill it with my latest favorite, Left Hand Milk Stout Sweet Stout. Think rich flavors of chocolate and coffee blended with milk sugars to give a sweet and creamy taste. In the large dining room you'll notice a wood fired oven. Unfortunately Rico's doesn't take full advantage of this, only offering a handful of menu items cooked in it including the BBQ Chicken Flatbread ($12). Covered with pulled chicken, red onions, Rico's BBQ sauce and mozzarella, this paired well with our beers though could have used a bit more salt, easily remedied. Another glimmer of what could be was the Wood Oven Baked Penne ($13). Several large meatballs, roasted tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and pesto ricotta cheese and al dente pasta made for a hearty satisfying meal. A bit lighter but bold with flavor, the Chopped Salad ($10, add grilled chicken $3) made with grilled corn, black beans, bacon, tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, and BBQ-ranch dressing was shaken, not stirred, literally. The salad is brought out in a large martini shaker, dressing added on the spot then shaken well. Kind of a neat twist on table-side salad service, what's old is new again. The Wicked Meatloaf ($15) could have used some of Rico's BBQ sauce for a sweet contrast instead of the semi-boring-more-like-brown-gravy cracked pepper demi. The meaty slabs were paired up with roasted garlic mashed potatoes that were well seasoned and comforting.   Perfectly cooked and perfectly tender, the New York Strip Steak ($21) had a warm poblano and bacon relish that I could have eaten by the spoonful. The smoky sweet relish made the need for any sort of steak sauce not necessary. Along side was a heaping helping of green chile mac 'n' cheese, so creamy and so gone, delish. Apple Skillet For other ($7) takes apple slices simmered in a brown sugar and cinnamon, thanks to the wood-burning oven, then topped with cake crumbles and served with cinnamon vanilla gelato. If the skillet weren't so hot I would have licked it clean. While Rico's may not have yet achieved culinary greatness, what you do get is solid Southwestern influenced American grub.
other Made an appointment on the day I went. I only had my lunch break, but they made it a worthwhile and affordable experience! No hidden charges for the exfoliating salt scrub. I received a beautiful pedicure in a clean atmosphere in under an hour. Success!
other One of the best local places to get your booze!BevMo has nothing on the charm, history, and liquor selection of a place like this! I am not into most beers or wines (of which they have plenty), rather I like to sample the odd/exotic Vodkas, Rums, and Tequillas.Sportmans is a good value, but certainly not discount -it is so worth the better exprience tho- This is a store to browse, ask questions and take your time exploring.Give Sportsmans a shot - and you'll say "No Mo BevMo!"
other My boss took us here for a little Holiday lunch the other day and i have been dreaming about the burger ever since! Seriously, the term "cheeseburger" doesn't even to justice to the masterpiece they brought me! And the parmesan and truffle oil fries were amazing, too! The decor is kind of cool, sort of an American Teddy Roosevelt feel... Grand old pictures, deer head, and dark wood mixed with high ceilings and light colors so it doesn't feel all heavy. Ok, back to the food... The burger has applewood smoked bacon and grilled onions mixed into the patty. It is incredibly juicy without being greasy! They top it with Havarti cheese, place it on a buttered grilled brioche bun, and serve it with a couple of different sauces... One was like a garlic butter type of sauce and the other was like a horseradish mayo. I ate every single bite and didn't care that i was stuffed to the gills or looked like a pig in front of my co-workers! To leave any bit of that on the plate would have been a travesty!  I can't wait to take hubby here for lunch (dinner would be wayyyyyyy too expensive).
other Ok seriously I don't miss Arizona but I sure in the hell miss this place. I daydream about this place....I miss everything on the menu because trust me I tried it...I was a hungry pregnant women on the prawl....besides I loved the live music and the hummus was out of this WORLD!!!If you haven't gone....go you won't regret it...It's one of the few things about Arizona I miss.....
other Horrendously overpriced. ~$13 for an xlarge other topping that I had to bake myself? The pizza itself was better than average, but if you don't bake on location then at least make it cheaper than going to pizza hut and having it delivered to my door, ready to eat.I'm glad I had the experience, but I don't see where the benefit to this is, at all. It isn't more cost-effective than going to the grocery for frozen pizza, and it isn't that much better than frozen.On the plus side, the gal at the counter that made my pizzas was very nice, but it's a shame I don't see this kind of business surviving. I probably won't return, I am pretty disappointed.
other I got 3 strikes at Verde, hence...I'm out! Strike 1: Not very vegetarian friendly. Strike 2: They have all the necessary items to make nachos, but when asked if they would make me nachos I got a very quick and blunt "NO". Strike 3: When forced to order a meat dish and request they not include the meat (the most EXPENSIVE ingredient) not only did they make no attempt to substitute the meat with maybe beans, or guac, or extra cheese, they still charged full price! I don't want to eat meat and I sure don't want to pay for it. And as far as the food, well, they got that part right, for a place that serves fine fast food, when you ask me how my meal was, my response would be "Fine".
other Words cannot express how much I love the meat shop. I love it like a fat guy loves the place that sells him the best bacon he has ever had... because I am and it is.I'll be honest, it can be a bit intimidating walking in to the Meat Shop for the first time, if you aren't a chef and don't know your cuts, you may be afraid, but don't fear just ask for help because the staff are excellent!Whether beef, pork or lamb, the meat here is always the best quality, and knowing its locally raised and by people who care about what they are doing makes it even better. And price? I've never compared closely but I don't really think twice about the price here!Be warned! If you buy meat here, you will be ruined! You will never again be able to purchase that saltwater packed, antibiotic injected, hormonally treated, ammonia and pink good filled crap in your supermarket again!And that is a very, very good thing.
other I've been going to Lake Pleasant Dentistry for 2-3 years now and Dr. Sharon Bader is hands-down the best dentist I've ever had.  I've traditionally had bad experiences with dentists and am always wary of any dental procedure, but I've never felt more comfortable than with Dr. Bader.She is very accommodating, puts you at ease, explains all the options and does GREAT work and will stand behind it.  She did a pretty complex crown for me when the tooth was borderline whether it could be saved and it worked out great.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this practice to anyone.
other Best calamari in town, and awesome service. Tokyo glow is a great drink, super refreshing.
other I totally love this place. It reminds me of the old school hardcore Chinese restaurant my parents used to take us when we were kids :D The decor is amazing- unlike more Chinese places in Phoenix. The walls are a teal blue, adorned with large carved pieces of artwork depicting scenes in China, golden dragons and more. The lights hanging from the ceiling are amazingly ornate. The place looks like its from a bygone era (doesn't help that its in a run down strip mall) but it is clean and charming inside.The service was great- kind to our other yo, and very attentive. The food was the best part- I can't remember the last time I had such good Chinese food, and it's priced very reasonably. We got the Peking dinner for other which included the fried noodles, hot tea, wonton soup (with generous noodles, meat, shrimp and veggies, the best I've ever had), a pupu platter with eggrolls, bbq skewers, house wings and those cheese puff thingies (the presentation is pretty cool, too). Next came 3 entree sized plates of food: mongolian beef, fried chicken (can't remember the name) and the Peking fried rice. The meal concluded with incredible little desserts- sort of like eggrolls but filled with banana and then covered with crystalized honey. I could have eaten 100 of them! Adding in a beverage and tax, the meal was only $34! My other yo can really eat, so I am surprised and pleased to say that even with sharing the dinner for other people with him, the 3 of us walked out with lots of leftovers. Highly recommended. Do it! DO IT!
other Wow!  I enjoyed staying here!  Huge rooms!  We had three adults and two children and everyone had plenty of room!  Highly recommended!
other The atmosphere was nice what we saw of it. Our party had dined at this establishment over 20 times and we where placed at the worst table in the place on the second floor in the back. The food was good and the service adequate. when we left the valet asked us if we came in the old BMW it is four years old and cost over 100,000. I am never going back and will tell all my friends that this place is not acceptable.
other HA HAHAHAHAHA! "Pit" is right.... man, this place would have been a terrible idea if i wasn't already expecting lameness.now occupying the space that has seen the death of not one, but two dance club (41other and Level), Peach Pit Afterdark.... I mean Cherry Lounge and Pit is beyond ghetto.opened by the same people who do sugar daddy's and dos gringos, this place has all the sexiness and allure of a Trails commercial. You know? I was half expecting to turn a corner to see a neon colored bikini-clad bleached blonde on top of a motor boat. well, they've updated the look of the cage-trapped go-go dancers to mini panties with knee-high dragon rider boots with fuzzy muppet skins adorning them.the vids of drunken lounge-goers (a la daddy's and now dos) playing in tiny screens on the walls in hallways and behind bars in tact, interspersed with footage of seriously hagard looking chics doing "sexy" things like sucking on lollipops, cherries, winking (yes, she was winking right at you, wasn't she? inviting you in to her red-drenched lair to bask in the glow of a alcohol doused club circa 1992).i'm not sure what the DRESS CODE we were so violently and largely reminded of in line, but the girl in front of me had on an oversized T-shirt, baggy jeans and flip flops (?) and they took her $other and let her in no problem. i also saw a girl dressed exactly like peggy bundy...no joke, spandex black calf leggings, long spandwex shirt in orange, heels and a giant boob belt. it was so incredible i took a picture. she was not impressed with my observation, so i had to sneak the photo.anyway.... take it for what it is, a club owned by dos gringos guys on mill ave.
other Postinos on the East side!?Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to Postinos, oh yeahIt's closer to the truth to say I can't get enough You know I'm gonna have to face it, I'm addicted to Postinos Thanks Robert Palmer and let's just say I wouldn't be surprised to see the fashion models around here.  Very attractive crowd!  I am honor just to be here!  Another bottle of wine and you'll be mine, a one track mind I can't be saved other flavors of Bruschetta is all I crave If there's some left for you and don't mind if I do I might as well face it I'm addicted to PostinosI've always enjoyed attending Postinos on the West side of town, but the East side adds a new flavor.  The place still has a great deal on Monday and Tuesday nights.  Bottle of wine plus a large plate of bruschetta's for $20!  The ambience is always chill and low lighting.  Quite romantic and add some pretty ladies and I'm golden here!  Service is always great at Postinos.  The staff is definitely well train in the knowledge of wine and their service is spectacular! - Enjoy!
other I stopped in with a friend on a Saturday night after a friend had recommended it to me and was totally thrilled we did. We sat at a table for sushi and waited no longer than 10 minutes for a table - amazing for 8 pm on a Saturday in old towne.Unfortunately, they had sold out of the oysters, but the other dishes we'd ordered were fabulous - starting with a seared tuna dish, then softshell crab roll, rainbow roll, and the green mussels. The seared tuna was cooked and cut perfectly - just the right temperature with a peppery "rub," the rolls were a decent size with thick cuts of fish and plenty of flavorful crab, and the mussels were a tad overcooked for my preference but the creamy texture and buttery flavor still made it a winner. The thing I appreciated most was actually the service - we weren't rushed or hassled, and the food came out a dish at a time, giving us a chance to eat and enjoy before getting our next dish. At other sushi joints, I am constantly feeling rushed while trying to fit all of the dishes on the table (and I'm not what you'd call a slow eater!). This was a happy medium for me. The server confirmed that we were ready for the bill instead of just dropping it off without asking - it's the little details that make a big difference to me.My only other con was creepy old men leering at us from the bar...but that's what you get in Scottsdale.
3 I stopped in here at 6:45am one morning and was told I was a bit early.  I'm used to coffee shops opening earlier I guess, but they were nice about it and invited me in to sit and wait. I liked their stacks of Latin American Vogue, and the artwork on the walls was nice.  They also had ice water out for you to serve yourself. I ordered my usual americano, and was pleased.  They have raw sugar you can serve yourself by the heaping spoonful out of a pretty candy dish.  That was lovely.Also, they are now the only place to carry Sweet Peas Bakery items.  My favorite thing to do was walk down to Danielle's shop downtown and pick up some coffee at Royal and some of her Rosemary Shortbread cookies.  It doesn't sound yummy, but believe me they are!  Be sure to ask for some. At the time I went, the place was obviously not crowded and I received attentive service...
other I can't believe this wasn't reviewed yet!  This place rocks, and Dr. Heather is the very best vet in town. She's reasonable in price, thorough in her evaluations, and super kind. She handled the life and death issues so carefully and warmly, and she talks about her own pets and has compassion! When our cat Everett died, she not only called us throughout the whole cremation process, but she sent a card and when we picked up the ashes - she had made a single footprint "ornament" with a ribbon and his name on it as a gift.  Never had a vet do anything so kind.  We have had MANY cats and MANY VETS.  I know a good vet. Go here. Please go here!
3 Good barbecue, but not great. I ordered the BBQ Sampler and shared with my wife.  With an extra side and a delicious chocolate chip cookie for dessert, it was plenty of food.  Unfortunately, the quality of the food wasn't as high as I was expecting based off of all the Yelp reviews. All of the meats were very tender... The brisket and pulled pork especially.  But they were devoid of significant taste and had to be drowned in BBQ sauce in order to taste anything.  Thankfully the sauce was excellent and readily available.  Of all the meats I sampled, the winner here was the ribs.  Definitely not the meatiest, but extremely tender. I could pull the bones right out and devour.  Delicious!Outside of the food, everything was excellent.  I arrived at peak time on a Saturday night, and the line moved quickly.  It snaked through the restaurant and out the door, around the corner, but it moved quickly.  We waited no longer than 30 - 40 minutes.  All of the servers were extremely nice and helpful.  There was plenty of seating available, especially outside.  It was a lovey place to enjoy a meal.  It is unfortunate that the quality of the BBQ does not rise above "medium" to match the high quality of the rest of Joe's Real BBQ.
other I stopped by here last night after the Suns game. It was cheap and fast. Also, it was by far the best carne asada I have ever tasted. It was tender and juicy, and not at all rubbery. I know the last time I had carne asada it was rubbery, but that was also from a 'bertos joint. I enjoyed the way this place is set up. Walk up to the counter, order and they bring you your food. It is quick and efficient. We got the dinner for 2, other tacos, other burritos, chips and drinks for $20. The tacos were great, as were the burros. I will definitely be back. Oh the other stars are specifically for the quick, efficient service... and the BEST carne asada around.
other I came to this location in Tempe after visiting the Picazzo's in Sedona.  I ordered the Puttanesca Pizza (no olives) with Garlic Butter Crust again because it really is THAT good!! I think the crust was even better this go 'round!  The Chocolate Chip Skillet with Coconut Vanilla Ice Cream is great and big enough to share!  We enjoyed sitting outside on the beautiful outdoor patio on such a beautiful day!
other Best pizza place ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
other Okay, I have been to DryBar on multiple occassions and have been pleased once, maybe twice, but it wasn't horrible.  Unfortunately, the day of my wedding was horrible.  My fault that I didn't go in for a practice run, BUT I was assured by their ANSWERING SERVICE that I would get "one of their best," because that's who they send out.  The lady that came to our hotel room to do our (my mom and me) hair was rude and not talented.  She barely spoke and when she did it was defensive and not from a place of yes.  When a bridesmaid (who went to DryBar to get her hair done and wasn't satisfied) agreed with me that my hair style should be fixed, the stylist looked at her phone and said,"well, what time is it?" as she argued with us that she couldn't do anything else with my hair because it's fine.  We were like "we don't care what time it is, it's my wedding, and I will pay you whatever it takes to get my hair looking the way I want it."  My mom hated her hair, took pictures to send to DryBar and then fixed it herself.  The problem with getting a quick solution is that they have an answering service which makes problem solving an issue, especially when you have limited time and makes scheduling a large group complicated.  Again, I've been happy once or twice, they have a few good stylists and a lot of very mediocre ones.  I think I'll try some of the other blowdry bars in town.
other Why oh why can't there be one of these closer to my house?! I would take them any day over Subway. Their bread is fresh, their meat and cheese is sliced perfectly thin. This may sound strange too, but every Mr. Goodcents I've been too has the BEST soda fountain Coke. Okay...I said it. Judge me. I do prefer the Mr. Goodcents over in Tempe off of 48th Street, but this one is just as good.
other What  a beautiful facility. Attention to detail is what this place is about and the army of workers each takes his / her portion of the details and does a mighty fine job. If you want a high end place to stay. This is a good choice. When I made my hotwire reservation and ended up here, I got the deal of the century! I am sure the rack rate is high, but if you want comfort and great facility. this would be a wonderful choice! Oh yes, Everyone and I mean everyone was soooo nice. The gardeners,  the cleaning staff, the front desk, the parking attendant, all of them were super nice and fun and genuinely happy to be of service..
other Other than the really great happy hour prices, its hit or miss with this place. More often a miss. :(The food is less than average, the drinks NOT strong ( at least they are inexpensive) , but the service is truly hit or miss.I'll pass.
3 About 1.6 miles roundtrip from the Maricopa Ramada.  Pretty cool little climb, but then you end up on a road heading to the summit.  Near the top, you get to go offroad for a bit to the very top.  You can see 7th St go all the way downtown.Total time up and back was 50:12.  Pretty easy hike.  This was my third of four mountains, one Saturday in April.
other Andrea has been a lifesaver- literally! She was watching over our furry monsters when our AC went out  in July and we were across the country. She not only made an extra visit just to see if the AC was broken, but helped us find an open kennel to get our cats boarded. She's been our creature sitter several times now, thankfully with less craziness.Her rates are very reasonable and she keeps in great contact with you. Her initial visit with us went over all the little things we wanted done (like picking up the paper and bringing it in) and was very thorough. Since she offers a full house sitter and pet sitter menu of services, she's knows things to cover that we had not thought of! She's very professional and is licensed and insured. Your animals will thank you!
other Well, I guess the bar is much lower in Flagstaff, as we went to their restaurant in Glendale for breakfast.  It was less than mediocre.  Starting with the coffee, which tasted awful..it was very bitter and watching the waitress pour old decaffinated coffee into a regular coffee pot! Unacceptable.  I had bacon and eggs...fair. Asked for the hashbrowns to be well done..didn't make a difference, I guess, as they came out raw.  Also, asked that my toast be dry...came out saturated with butter.  My husband had the chicken fried steak with gravy...you could have plastered a house with the gravy!  As you can tell, we will not be returning.  The reason we went, was because of their article in the paper this week.  Just shows, that you can't believe believe everything you read.  My husband, "jokingly, suggested, that we cancel the paper!
3 My wife and friends went for lunch the the other day and liked it so I thought I'd give it a try.  Nice place, nice menu - good selections. I had the meatball hero lunch special.  Good meatball hero (meatballs with marinara + extra for cheese to make it meatball parm) - it was good; too big for lunch - I would have been satisfied with half with a handful of chips and a deli pickle spear or peperocini on the side vs. just the hero sitting on the plate solo (hope the owner reads Yelp!).I'll go back and try something else.  Good food, good location should do well.Who mounted all those nice TV's in there?  Shaquille O'Neal?  You get a neck ache looking up that high!PS - hey food runner, when you deliver a slice of pizza and it starts to slide off the plate don't use your bare hand to move the pizza - gross!  You know you saw me watch you do that too!
other This hidden gem is located just outside of Mill Ave and is apparently the hipster home base of Tempe. If somehow you are allowed in without suspenders or nonprescription clear glasses, you will see exactly what goes on. to the left at least four people playing chess, to the right someone reading a book, but sitting next to someone writing a book, and did someone just walk in with a puppy? Yes. As you walk up to the counter you are already disoriented so you may be confused about what to order. Well, they are known for their cappuccinos, which I can personally vouch for but on a hot summer day in Arizona, I recommend their "Dirty Horchata" or "Espresso Excellente" a rice milk horchata with shots of espresso. It was good for the minute it lasted. See you there next time.
other Leah, the trainer, at Dog House Training Academy is great. She's friendly, knowledgable, and makes herself available via e-mail or phone should you have any questions. Her knowledge on dogs is extensive, and even though you're just paying for the class, she'll gladly offer up advice on any issues you may be having with your dog. The classes seemed simple enough to me, but there was a client in my class that just wasn't picking it up at all and blatantly disregarding her techniques. I was impressed with how Leah handled the situation and the customer. She's very thorough, and always explains why she does things the way she does, and why it works. So there are no questions, and it's always made perfect sense to me. With the quality of service, and the knowledge that you get to tap into while you're training with Leah, you just can't find a better deal out there. Her rates are competitive, and she offers referral discounts too.
other I was there on a Friday night with a few friends in the hopes of a quick drink and nosh after a show next door.My companion and I ordered basic drinks and were met with shots of liquor in the bottoms of our glasses and a blank look from the waitress when I asked if they were out of mixers.  After this, we opted not to order any food (taking our cue from the inability to mix gin with tonic water) and were met with an outrageous bill (for our two 'well' shots).  We questioned the tally and were met with a second total that wasn't much better.  Our credit card was charged twice: $40 for some wet ice and a lemon wedge.  There are many cool and artsy places in Phx where we can catch live music and nosh with friends.  I'll pass this one up from now on.
3 The bf and I wanted to try someplace different on our venture out to North Scottsdale so we decided to give Coal Burger a try.  The menu is pretty small, which isnt good or bad.  I had the green chile burger and my bf had the bacon blue burger and we shared a side order of mixed fries.  The burgers were not bad but not great.  The flavors were pretty well mixed together but the burger itself was just blah!  The fries were ok as well, nothing special.I would go back to give them another try.  They have interesting sodas on tap that are natural.  The shakes look good so will try those the next time I am in the area.
other It should be no surprise that the ambience and service at this restaurant located inside a other star resort is impeccable. What is heartening though is that the food is good as well. What was even better of course was that i wasnt paying for it:) (business dinner) We had crab cakes and pork ribs for appetisers which was delicious. For the main course i had the Ahi with the mustard sauce that was so flavorful. My colleagues had the shrimp and butterfish and they liked their dishes as well. For dessert we had the upside down pineapple cake. I really enjoyed my  experience here and would recoomend it to those who love seafood and want an evening of fine dining.
3 This place is too loud.  It would have been nice to have a meal without some lady yelling 'meatlog' across the room.  Also the waitstaff was somewhat incompetent and snobby.  The food was delicious but it's not something anyone can make themselves at home.  They are stingy with their bread even though it is now free. Lots of annoying things that will probably persuade me not to come back.
other HUGE fan!Love Poncho, the birthday strobe lights, the food and the service. This is a go-to for my boyfriend and I when we're looking for sushi. More likely than not, we'll opt for the all you can eat option for $20/ person. With that comes with miso soup, salad, sashimi, your AYCE picks, ice cream and with a special frequent customer request, this awesome pan seared, naturally fatty sea bass belly and salmon cheeks, which are AMAZING. Not a taste for everyone, kinda bizarre for most. But this will be well appreciated by traditional Asian taste and PERFECT for me. Loyalist here.
other I'm from California and every time I visit Arizona I have to make a stop here. The ambiance is very nice and classy and located in a great/fun area. The bar and drinks are great and the food is fantastic. Like i said, I'm from California and live in the Bay Area, so I thought I knew what great seafood was - wrong! Who knew that the desert had better (well almost better) seafood than San Francisco or Monterey Bay?  I had the Vanilla Battered Sole with Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese - Amazing! Never tasted anything like that - I recommend that this place be the first stop to anybody looking for a fun night out.
other I found Gaylee to be the most unprofessional nail tech.  I found her on an internet deal.  I called her on Sat and requested an apt on the following Friday.  She never returned my call till I reported her.  She denied my other messages and said she only got one msg which she couldn't return cause she lost her voice.  She conveniently had a voice after she was investigated.  I would never trust her to do my nails.  Yet reading the reviews she did return some calls.
other Great sports bar!  Shows most UFC, Boxing and WWE pay per views.  Friendly staff, good food....  draft beer selection could be a little better, but other than that, one of my favorite local pubs.
3 Just a quick review to get the ball rolling. Popped in here on opening night, and was pleasantly surprised. Hubby and I split the Mussaman, a hearty portion of curried veggies and short-ribs, and the Garlic Veggies with tofu. The Mussaman was by far the star, and given it's $16 entree price it needed to be. I see a lot of promise here, though I do find the prices to be rather high for this neighborhood. I should hope once they get their liquor license (expected sometime in January according to the waitress) that the food prices will come down. I'm not holding my breath on this one, however, since the moniker "Modern Thai" has become euphemism for "Expensive Thai." I look forward to trying SaBai again after they've had some time to coalesce.
other This place is great - IF YOU LIKE TO BE IN A SNOBBY ENVIRONMENT!  There are not too many places that I've been to that are more hype than anything.  But this is one of them.  When you try to go to THE PINK TACO, it's impossible to find a parking space.  Once you make your way to the front, the hostess is always too busy texting her friends than interested in helping the customer!!  If you are lucky enough to find a seat at the bar, you better have a rolex watch on or you will not be served quickly.  Either that, or you better be a Hugh Heffner spouse.  I tried the burrito and was grossed out by how rubbery it was.
other Where I had the most delicious thing I ever put in my mouth.This is a favorite of me and my friends, especially for sunday morning brunch. I would say we go at least one time a week. Their Quiche (especially the Goat cheese, caramelized onions, and wallnuts) is the best you will ever have and their salad dressing (which is made in house) is equally delicious. The most delicious thing I have ever eaten in my whole life was actually a rose macaroon. I have never had an emotional reaction to a food item before but I swear I almost cried and had flashbacks of my childhood being at the botanical gardens. Any way, if you haven't been here you HAVE to go. Its one of Arizona's few authentic cultural treasures.
3 Monday Morning - take outRoom for improvement - - same curt, terse service- too cramped to actually look around and appreciate their items for sale- food was average, but not worth all the fuss this place requires.+ I like the food for the most part and you can't go too wrong with a red velvet cupcake...can you?This place is all fuss and hippity dippity so i surmise that is the situation with the crowds.    I am sure I will be dragged there again by another friend in that neigborhood so I will try to look with new eyes.:)
other So, I have to admit that I once threw up in the Pita Jungle bathroom, but it was not Pita Jungle's fault - it was definitely something I ate the night before.  It certainly made for a memorable first date experience with my now husband, and we have been back many many times.Oh, how I love Pita Jungle.  I haven't tried anything that I wouldn't have again in a heartbeat - currently I am hooked on the Potato Pizza.  yummy!Their breakfast options are wonderful - definitely try it on a lazy Sunday morning.  There is usually no wait.The ambiance is fantastic, casual and arty, with a little bit of crunchy granola thrown in.A++ for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike.  Eat hummus and pita.  Try falafel.  Try anything on the menu, because it is all good.
other The customer service here could be 100% better but then again not much around here is anywhere near the greatness of texas customer service!!  Was not greeted when walking in and waiting for about 2other minutes!
3 Even though I am officially in my 30s, I look like I'm still in college, which made me feel slightly less uncomfortable when I walked into The Clubhouse. Yes, it is near ASU, and yes, it is an all-age venue, so I should have expected that the club would be filled with 18-20 somethings. But just because I look 21, doesn't mean that my internal reality made me feel a little out-of-place. But, I was like, whateva!It is somewhat of a dive bar trying to be a club but failing miserably. Like a nerd trying to be punk or a cheerleader trying to be emo -- it somehow didn't work for me. It felt like I was in someone's basement turned rocker's haven. Black walls, haphazard decor, and one sole stinky quasi-couch that looked like it had been salvaged from some dump. The stage was at the front of the club, and the bar in the middle dissected the under-2other crowd from the over-2other boozers. Unfortunately, if you wanted to drink, you had to stay on the over-2other side of the bar. That sucked because you barely had a view of the stage. WTF?!  Shouldn't the paying lushes get a better view than the youngsters who only paid to get in the club? Stupid. I have to say, though, the sound system was a helluva lot better than some of the other small music venues I've been to.  That's a plus.  Finally, this last annoyance will definitely show my age, but having to stand the entire time I was there was horrible. My feet hurt, dammit! And, I just wanted to sit down! But, I'll suck it up the next time because there are some great bands that play here, and for me, great music can make any situation better.
other Of all the Dairy Queens I've been to in my life in CA, TX and now AZ, this is the nicest and cleanest location I've been to. I guess that's what happens in Awhatukee.The staff is fast when you order inside and also when you order through the drive thru.I could eat Chicken Finger Baskets and Blizzards all the time! I'm happy to live so close to this location and enjoy all the wonderful treats this place has to offer.
other My husband and I LOVE El Metate... we joke about putting a line item in our budget for this place we eat there so much. Their food is delicious, they are family owned and operated - always friendly. Their hot sauce is to die for, both green and red. It's possible I like El Metate better than Amados!
other This is a good place to go when you're hungry, but don't want the "blah" weighed-down yucky, greasy feeling.  I always order the greek pita, well, because I'm a feta fan! Yes, a large amount of the menu has feta, so if you don't like it, you may want to rethink coming here.  The rice pilaf is delicious, I also love the fruit bowls (not a fan of the pasta salad).  Chicken salad is good, but I think it needs some salt & pepper personally. Yaya's chocolate cake is really yummy! All in all, I enjoy this place!
3 with airlines, always hit or miss. delta by far my worst experience on one flight, excellent on the next. american airlines....for our most recent vacation, just run of the mill. we were boarded quickly and efficiently. in the turks and caicos, our flight was cancelled due to a mechanical issue, but then we got to spend an extra night at the Beaches resort (free food and alcohol anyone). although it did take them other hours in the crappy providenciales airport to let us know the flight was cancelled, but 30 minutes later, i was happy as a pig in slop with other mixed drinks in my hand and 3rd on the way, with other or other more to go. airlines...unless you're in first class, you're nobody.
other we went here for dinner and drinks, and it was awesome. the giant soft pretzels are amazing, buttery, and delicious and are served with a roasted pepper cheese sauce. they are awesome, but get them to share, the butteryness is rich! the prices are reasonable, and the patio is nice to sit out on! even better than the food, service, and prices is the music!! they play an awesome selection of music!!
other Sometimes it's difficult to really feel satisfied with a raw vegan diet , but every time I go to Pomegranate's I leave more than satisfied.   The atmosphere is welcoming and delightful, although very busy during the lunch rush. I did have to share a table with a stranger last time I was there but the stranger turned out to be a great lunch companion.  This is a must for anyone who is considering (or already is) a raw and/or vegan diet.  Everything is so yummy you won't know it is good for you!
other I agree with Ebony that sometimes Red Lobster does get a bad rap....but this location is a very good one......as long as you get here early (LOL). This locale is always busy.....but the food.....customer service....and the overall ambience of the place really shines. Molly was our server when the wife and I visited this locale for dinner this past Friday night. Right now they have a 1other dollar other course meal promotion.....and I am telling you it was the best 1other bucks I have ever spent. I started with the New England Clam chowder.....this is my favorite soup in the whole world BAR NONE. Then I had the Caesar Salad with the Cheddar Bay biscuits which I always have two baskets of ....because those Biscuits will really make you hurt someone they are so good......(LOL). I had the Shrimp and Grilled Chicken in a great garlic and butter sauce with garlic mashed potatoes.....OMG.....the chicken was so juicy and the potatoes just melted in my mouth.Dessert was a very rich and delicious Key Lime Pie......ALL THIS FOR 1other BUCKS......WOW. I felt like I was stealing in a way (LOL) but again if there is a better deal in the valley for a dinner this good.....please let me know. So run don't walk to you nearest neighborhood Red Lobster and try this deal before it's gone. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!
3 Priced Decent, Quantity Heavy. Just ordered a side of chips and got almost a pound of chips. I love chips and salsa, but this was too much than i thought. Anyway the food was good and seems to have a authentic Mexican flavor to it. Worth a short once, particularly if you are pretty hungry.
other Had to eat here with coworkers for lunch today and was incredibly disappointed. My $8 caesar salad was probably the tiniest I've ever had. Service was slow, the entire table was nearly finished before mine arrived, and staff was unapologetic. I've had side salads larger than the full salad they served me for lunch. Overall a miserable experience and I won't be back.
other This place does not disappoint.  I've been here quite a few times with coworkers and it's always a good choice.Cute place - I especially like sitting on their cozy, covered patio.  I hate mushrooms but somehow LOVE their fungi pizza.  I think it's the truffle oil that makes it amazing.  I've had a few of their other pizzas too, which are quite good as well. All of their salads are delish - you can't go wrong with any of them.If there's just one other person with you, you can't go wrong sharing a pizza and a salad.This place is WAY better than Pizzeria Bianco.Will continue to come back here!
other We have tried every Chinese delivery in Chander over the past few years and have found them all to be barely edible...and we aren't picky eaters. Honestly, fellow Yelpers, we even didn't like the one's you gave other stars. Where's the flavor? We tried Asian Grill delivery tonight - wonderful...delicious! We finally found excellent Chinese food delivery in Chandler!
3 If I could eat a southwestern Caesar salad once a day, every day, I think I would. This is one of my favorite salads...ever. Paradise in general is a little overpriced but one in a while, I'll bite the bullet and splurge. My only complaint is their lack of vegetarian options. For a restaurant that specializes in soups, salads and sandwiches, it would make sense to have more than one or two options in each category suitable for veggies.
other Upper Crust is like Grimaldi's on steroids. The two places have nearly identical decor and the pizza is extremely similar. Upper Crust uses a little more cheese which is nice, but they also use cornmeal on the crust which I am not crazy about. The wings are huge and delicious, especially with the honey BBQ sauce. The meatballs are nothing special (with or without the mozzarella cheese), but Stephanie H would disagree. Happy hour is Monday-Friday 4pm to 7pm and on Wednesdays they offer half off on bottles of wine. Overall, it is a very good pizza and I plan on returning. Next time I'll be giving that pizza cookie a try. I really liked Upper Crust, but Grimaldi's in Old Town is still my favorite for traditional NY style thin crust pizza.
other The food reminded me of my mom's home cooked meals. The beef with red salsa was super good...and not to mention the warm, handmade tortillas. The prices were decent, the service was excellent and the food was great. ;-)
3 Chain restaurant that's just about okay for afternoon dining with friends. If I wasn't having beer at lunch I'd probably suggest eating someplace else. Food is good but in my experience their beer makes the meal. I've eaten here about half a dozen times during the past few years when in town for business weekends.It is centrally located on the corner of Mill and Fifth Street in downtown Tempe, amongst quite a few other local restaurants. During my most recent visit I ordered a steak at lunch along with one of the seasonal brewed beers. Steak was okay but I wouldn't order it again. Beer was exceptional, so I wasn't unhappy overall.I love burgers and I think I'll stick to that as my primary choice when eating here in the future. I can't think of any times when service was particularly unsatisfactory, nor were there times when service really stood out as exceptional. I have almost always eaten here on a Saturday afternoon, and it's typically been fairly busy during the lunch hour. Never had a problem getting a table, which is important since I'm usually heading back for an afternoon conference session.I love the big glass beer mugs (not sure what size they are) but I can't always down the whole thing during a short lunch break (I'm a lightweight).Overall, good place to eat if you're hungry and in the downtown area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get here.
other Our dinner club ended up at Maizie's this month after the other pick was closed.... we lucked out! We were unknowingly there on $3 burger Monday, so pretty much everyone ordered the burger. They had told us the wait would be short, 15-20 minutes. It ended up being about 4other min, which was a little frustrating. But our waiter was awsome and fast and we received our food very quickly. I think us ravenous girls had a turnaround of about 30 minutes once seated. First I have to give homage to their fries... Both the regular and sweet potato are excellent. Well seasoned, with potato skins, and a nice balance of crispy and soft. Their chipotle dipping sauce is reminiscent of the yummy sauce at Delux. I got a basic burger with cheddar cheese - it was cooked perfectly to order and tasted great. Total bill: $5.00 ($3 burger + $other cheese +$other fries= amazing deal!)My friend's salad was huge and delicious looking with all kinds of good stuff on it. I want to go back and try a salad, and maybe pizza and sangria night (Tues & Wed) or, ooh, one of their stuffed burgers. I think I'll be back a few times...
3 If you have ever eaten at an exceptional German restaurant, you will be ruined for life. Years ago, the Haus would have gotten other stars. But after being turned on to a little gem in Gibson City, IL called "The Bayrn Stube" my appreciation of fatty meat and spices stuffed in an intestine laid on a bed of sauerkraut and red cabbage has been forever changed. Haus just doesn't quite measure up. The cup of soup before the entree tasted like it came out of a can and the bread looked like the sheets of Hawaiian bread you buy at wally world. Probably the biggest turn off was when they brought out the brown mustard still in a plastic squeeze container. My meal was the Nuernberger/Kassler combo for one, and I had enough left over for breakfast the next day. Their sausages seem to be of lesser quality than I would get at Sunflower and the red cabbage had some pork gristle in it. Not that I mind a little pork fat in my cabbage, but not chunks, and definitely not gristle. My friend ordered the Huehner (Chicken) Schnitzel, which had a very good flavor, it was the best part of either of our meals. They do have a nice selection of good beers on tap, no Aventinus though. If the food was anything other than German, it would get other stars. It is nice to have somewhere to get a schnitzel when I'm in the area, but I wouldn't drive out of my way to eat here.
other I am a fan. But I would like to be more of a fan, and so I am here harping on the two problems I have with CC. One is the parking mentioned by other reviewers and the other is the bad service at the food court. I don't mean the samples handed out on almost every aisle and the hassle of the lines as stereotypical fat people line up like hippos at a rotten carcass to 'just try a sample'. I mean the little restaurant inside the store where the hippos line up to drown their peptides in sugar and grease. The food at any CC is outstanding fast food at an unbelievably good price. The pizza is fresh and really tasty and only 9.99 for a whole pie, the soft-serve yogurt is a huge portion in a plastic cup for 1.49. The hotdogs are terrific. Everything else is good and cheap too. There are no problems with the food quality and price. It's the service. The service is indifferent and inconsistent. Somedays it's ok to order pizza to be picked up later for a party, and somedays it is not ok and the workers will claim that it is not a service and never has been. Liars. Fat liars. I actually typed lairs by accident which works too. I'm done with this review due to boredom. I just can't stand it when a great business carelessly regresses to the mean. Brave the parking and the neutral service because when you need a good hotdog/pizza/frozen yogurt, it's a great spot.
other Hands down the best Vietnamese food we've found in metro Phoenix.  Enormous bowls of delicious pho, served quickly with friendly and efficient service.  Our "go to" place for pho now.  Cheap too!
other How have I not sang Scott's praises yet? Well, here I go! Do you want a place for a good, solid, stick to your ribs breakfast without being too frou frou? Scott's is the joint! It's a Jewish deli in the middle of my neighborhood! I was so surprised that I hadn't noticed it before! Chrissy P invited me to join her for breakfast one morning and I was just blown away! On my first visit, I had the eggs Benedict. My only complaint was that my eggs were a tad overcooked, (not runny) and I wished for more hollandaise sauce. For my second visit, I brought my little sis and her BFF and we chowed! I had the Hash Mash and we shared an order of the french toast. I don't know why I challenged myself to my own personal "how much breakfast can you stuff into your stomach" contest, but I think I won. Everything was so good! There was nothing to complain about. I wish I could go to Scott's every day for a hearty breakfast! The dishes are simple, the service is straight forward, and I have NEVER walked away hungry. I will return very, very soon!
other Chambord margaritas are killer!
other The first thing that sticks out in my mind was the service.  Our waitress was all smiles and incredibly adorable!Edamame was perfectly steamedSushi was tastySalmon Teriyaki was delicioussake and kirin washed it all downprices are reasonable and the atmosphere is calming.
other Stayed here for my best friends birthday. We just wanted a relaxing weekend and that's what we got. We liked that the pool was open 24-7. There was a bar at the pool but nobody attending it which blew. So we would have to go inside in our bathing suits to order our drinks since they didn't have a menu outside. People say the rooms are dated, but we thought they were nice. We enjoyed every part of our stay with the exception of the bar out by the pool not being open.(If theres a bar, someone should be working it right?)
other I've been here quite a few times, and always love their food. Pretty good servings for the amount of money. Burger yesterday was a bit over-cooked, but the fries were great as always. I love how small it is - friendly staff and it always seems like the whole family is back there cooking and serving. Would definitely recommend. So all in all, great for the money, and convenient because it's close to my work, but I wouldn't drive across town for it.
3 Okay, so Kevin and I initially wanted to go to Samauri Sams next door, but they closed at other (seriously??), so we checked out Yelp reviews for this place and decided to give it a go. The atmosphere was... interesting. Very loud mural on the wall of a cartoon pig cooking meat, with innuendos littered all over the place (see photos other reviewers have left). It is a very clean establishment, and the staff was super welcoming and friendly. I am not a huge fan of barbecue, but my pulled pork sandwich was amazing, as well as the warm cornbread I got on the side. Kevin got something similar with some spicy sausage or something. I didn't care for his, mostly because I don't like spicy things, but he enjoyed it. I think the food and the staff is worth between other and other stars, but OMG the music. Nothing but really lame jazz and 90's soul music. Each song was progressively worse than the last, and I kid you not - Brian McKnight came on and I just about lost it. The music did not match the atmosphere and killed the vibe for us, although we had a few giggles and fully enjoyed being there anyway. Would I go again? Yes. Would I most likely strangle the person in charge of music next time? You can count on it.
other I don't actually hunt or fish, but after visiting this place, I'd like to take up those activities. This place is like a giant outdoors amusement park. Everything you could possibly want for outdoor activities is included in this store. I could spend hours in this store just looking at everything they have available. Plus, now I know where to buy the furniture if I ever get a hunting lodge.
3 I ordered a thin crust pizza for carry out from this location.  The staff was very friendly and the pizza was pretty good.  I look forward to trying their pasta in the near future.
other If you need fake nunchuks, old china, random golf clubs, and a great selection of clothes to sort through, then this is your savers.
other I have only gotten the cafe sua da (iced coffee) here but it's the best I have had yet. When you walk in there is always fresh coffee lined up in cups on the counter ready to be mixed with sweetened condensed milk. I don't get to Mesa often but when I do I go here for the wonderful, rich, dark and creamy coffee. This is strong stuff; that first sip is so good. The richness, full flavor, creamy caramel flavors are heavenly.  And as the ice melts, it mellows out the flavor a little and it's still great. I can't say I have had all the cafe sua da in the valley, but what I have had; this is my favorite. Next time I come to Mesa for work I will need to come at lunch time so I can try the pho.
other I have never eaten a regular meal here. I usually go for the reverse happy hour from 10-12pm. Cheap drinks, good food and a good atmosphere. The servers here are good. I don't eat sushi myself, but everyone I go with loves the Crunchy Crab Rolls. They have three different pizzas, pepperoni, BBQ chicken and cheese. I have had the pepperoni and BBQ chicken. Both were extremely good. I definitely recommend that someone looking for a good time, cheap drinks, and good food.
other Well i seen some other and other stars, don't know what the hell they talking about, but this place rocks. I gave them a other star cuz too many people take their kids and cant control them there. LOL. But the food is the SHIZZNIT!!!! The Chips they bring out are nice crunchy and salt to taste. the salsas and the Lil bean dip uffffff, love it. The food is nice and spicy, since I'm Mexican i can handle the heat. I always get the Pollo con Queso, can you say DELISIOSO!!! My favorite. Waiter/es all are kind and helping on ordering. If your into Mexican food, its a need to try.
other I'm not a coffee snob, but I love a good Americano.  This place has the charm you'd expect from a locally owned coffee shop complete with  eclectic decor, artwork on the walls, odds-and-ends of gaudy lamps and stained-glass windows.  The coffee is pretty good from what I have experienced.  The air-conditioning is right where it needs to be as well. Most important factor for this business:  very nice staff.  That alone makes me want to come by more often.
other The main reason for the four stars is for their Angus Roast Beef Dip -- it is delicious!  It is up there on my list of favorite French Dips. The meat is super tender and juicy, and the horseradish spread really compliments the sandwich. Plus, it is a great condiment to dip your french fries in.  The portions are huge -- my sister ordered the Sesame Chicken Salad and she barely ate half of it. I, of course, devoured my sandwich. They have a huge menu, with a lot to choose from. They seem to be known for their pizzas, which look really yummy too.The atmosphere is similar to most sports bars, although I'd say this place is more of a "high-end" sports bar with chandeliers and mood lighting instead of ripped vinyl and dirty blinds.  There is a massive flat screen TV. above the bar, and little ones interspersed throughout the restaurant. The wait can be a bit long on Friday nights and weekends, but you can call ahead to get your name on the wait list.  And, they are nice enough to offer you some small pizza bites while you wait.Overall, BJ's is your standard chain restaurant/sports bar, but with a few extra niceties to make it stand out above the rest.  I'll be back for sure, and maybe next time I'll venture outside my love-for-the-french-dip and try some of their other goodies.
other I went to Gordon Biersch for a birthday party at the beginning of the month.  I had fun, but it had little to do with the establishment.  We had a special "deal" of $17 because we were such a big party.  There were soft drinks included in the price, but alcohol was more.  I have no issue with this, but the food was not very good.  I had a pasta dish and it was fine, but I am not dying to eat it again.  Then, we get our bills.  The price was not $17, there was additional tax and tip added on (which again is fine, but deceptive when we were told it would be $17 per person).  Then, my pregnant friend had a cranberry juice and sparkling water.  This apparently was not on the included menu and she was charged a $other alcohol fee for her non-alcoholic beverage.  It just seemed a bit fishy to me.  Had it been an excellent meal, I wouldn't care about a few bucks, but it was just ok.
other Having lived in Chicago for most of my life I was more than nervous of what an Arizona pizza experience would be like. For the most part my assumptions were correct - but Grimaldi's is great! We get the margarita pizza and it's amazing. I'm normally a deep dish pizza person but Grimaldi's is slowly winning me over for thin crust. Also, this place has amazing cheesecake - the best I've ever had in a restaurant.
other Very friendly staff, or a fast food place-- their customer service and friendliness is unmatched.. I go more often than not simply because of the experience every time! Thanks Micky!
other This place looks sleek from the causeway, but the food is marginal. We had the veggie taco plate and the veggie burrito. Both lacked flavor, even the "spicy" salsa was bland. Server was friend and attentive, that is the only reason I am giving it two stars. I would just go here for a drink next time and skip the food entirely.
other Eh... pasta is way to salty.  Just just cause Mario B says cook your pasta in salt water, doesn't mean you have too and then dump salty sauce on top of it.  Tried to tell the manager but got blown off.  Just because you work for FRC doesn't mean you know what good food is.  Also, pizza greasy.
other Always consistent. Great service, great carne asada and a pleasant patio on a beautiful day.
other This salon is really cute. Fridays are 1/other off single sessions and this is why I keep coming back. I use the level other bed and on Fridays its only $other to tan. I wouldn't come here if they didn't have that though because membership prices are ridiculous and the customer service isn't that great.
other I usually hate chains, especially Italian ones like Olive Garden and Romanos. But I was pleasantly surprised my Maggianos. We went because we got a gift card for Christmas but we are probably going back. The bread and the dipping oil they start you out with is pretty good. I wish the dipping oil was just a little more seasoned though. My husband ordered the linguine and clams which he said was just ok. My stepson had the crab and shrimp cannelloni which he enjoyed. I really liked my eggplant Parmesan. It is the best egg parm I have had at a chain. The sauce is fresh tasting which huge chunks of garlic.One nice surprise is that our server said that my dish qualified for a free take home dish of the same category. So I ordered the gnocchi and had a nice dinner the next day.
other My go-to restaurant for very tasty, genuine Thai food. Great lunch specials.  Favorites from the dinner menu: fish cake, tom kha soup, pad thai, hot basil, Thai iced tea
other The food was good but, for the price, there are a lot better steak houses.  For this price point, I would suggest Donovan's or Mastro's.
other Dilemma: where the heck to find a nice place to eat near AZ Fairgrounds/Grand? (Shiverrrrrrrrrrrrr)Promblem solved!  Found the answer @ Fez!Candace was super speedy, always had a smile, and returned to our table about a dzn times in the 90 mins we were here.Gazpacheo & Grilled Crustini was OMG good!  (problem was it only came with 3 tiny pieces of bread, had to ask for more, got few pieces of pita, still had 1/other left bowl of gazpacheo, asked for more bread - cuz like what the heck are you going to do with a bowl of dip otherwise? and they charged us for the extra bread?  x other ?  not cool).Cheese & Garlic Fondue was pretty good.  So was the Chicken Strips.Really good drink specials (unfortunately, had none as their specialties are mostly tequila based - not for me!  nor am I a beer drinker, and I did not like their house wine).  But I did have a nice bottle of Sav. Blanc from New Zealand.Anyhow, this fit the bill at having fabby Nom~Noms before heading over to the Coliseum (~ick~) at the Fairgrounds to see the Roller Derby Girls - Whoop~ Whoop!
other I've gone here three times and each time with a different group. I have never ate here so I'm reviewing on games and booze.First off, I think every time I've walked in the door I was greeted with two things - a bouncer checking IDs and a nice strong whiff of beer. Hello, if you didn't already know it... you're in a bar.The place is kind of broken in to 3 parts - a bar, a restaurant, and a game room (billiards, ping-pong, darts, video games, air hockey, shuffleboard, etc.). I've played them all and I've enjoyed all the games. This is a pretty good place to just mess around with friends and BS and quite honestly this kind of reminds me of bars in Ohio where I'm from, albeit a bit more upscale since there is more. There is a lot of pool tables, so I would say that if you did have to wait, you wouldn't have to wait long. There is at least other tables.I don't remember my bill total, but generally I get here and just play games or only have one drink. So I can't really even comment on the pricing.
other Finally veered away from my usual sandwich or cold rice noodles and ordered the beef pho....darn it was good!
other Cibo doesn't appear to need my review, since they have a lot of fans here and other places.  This is a good lunch spot if you can get there early enough to avoid a wait.  The patio is particularly nice when the weather permits.  I work about five blocks from here and I've only been there for lunch.  I've wanted to try dinner but something about coming all the way back downtown after I've driven home to Gilbert just doesn't appeal.  Maybe on a day off sometime.  The food is great.  I like the speck sandwich.  Speck, for the uninitiated, is just another kind of cured ham like prosciutto.  The bread is always perfectly toasted.  Currently they offer as sides a salad, fruit, or chips.  An orzo salad, a la Carly's, would be a nice addition.
other ok, let me be straight with you. i hate paying full price for anything. yes, i'm one of those people. i love a coupon. i love a discount. and i absolutely love a bargain! but i don't like to feel dirty when i leave a store. i felt really, really dirty when i left this store. ewwwwww. this is a yucky ross. dirty, dirty, dirty! the floors and clothing racks were filthy. i couldn't have bought something even if i wanted to because the store was so gross - i got black "stuff" on my hand after touching a clothing rack. the floor was so discolored i'm not sure what the original color was. parts of the store's floor were sticky. many of the clothes had indistinguishable marks on them, presumably from the dirty hangars and racks they are stored on. selection was meager, there wasn't a single shoe, bag, wallet, sock or home decor item that caught my eye. the trip was a waste of an hour that i'll never get back. never, ever again.
other Needs a new name - now.  The Pischke's of old had such a sad ending.  I appreciated McGrath's effort to keep "Pischke's" alive.  But it is nothing, nothing, nothing like the Pischke's of old.  Call it "The Blue Ribbon Cafe" - take out the PIschke name - I can't imagine that Chris PIschke would have been honored to be remembered this way.  If his restaurant was a reflection of who he was as a person - Pischke's Blue Ribbon Cafe would be the exact opposite of who he was.  The current restaurant is not a laid back, family friendly and yet a bar all at once restaurant that serves an unending array of crazy good sandwiches/salads/etc - the current decor is pretentious, and the food matches that.
other With regard to AMber W.'s points1. I'm rating the food not the containers or the owners2. If it makes you feel better eating subpar food because of the American Spirit so be it. Others of us are more concerned with the food itself.3. I'm not downgrading it because it's not a sit down restaurant. Even among non-sit down restaurants or "fast food" style Indian themed eateries, this place is subpar. I've eaten at quick Indian eateries and they are much better than this.4. My review is for people who understand and can appreciate good Indian food. It's not for people who value text service, nice containers and chatty owners.5. I want to support mom and pop and locally owned restaurants but I also want to support good ones and not encourage bad ones to emerge simply because there is no competition for Indian themed restaurants here.
other I love this place. What can I say? Richard Cho not only has some of the best customer service skills I have ever seen (that guy has an amazing memory for names) but some of the most creative approaches to making Sushi in the valley. I love coming to Sushi Eye, I have never had a bad experience in all the years I have been going to the 2x New times Best of Phoenix award winner.The use of Macadamia nuts is brilliant and an amazing addition to many of the creative rolls that are available. The Spicy scallop roll is a go to for sure. They have (and I know this sounds stupid) the BEST California rolls in Arizona. As pedestrian as that roll is, The California roll is transformed in to a very dessert style treat when ordered at Sushi Eye. Seriously, do it.Go check it out, introduce yourself to Richard and be amazed when he remembers your name. You will be amazed by the food as well.
other This is a standard place to celebrate Birthdays. The drinks are delicious especially the kiwi and acai specialty drinks. The rolls are over $10, but they are unique and tasty. The environment is very cool and the location is great. Parking is bad just like everywhere in Scottsdale, you need to park in the street. Location is great because you can grab dinner here and then go out after. There is also karaoke available if you want to rent a room for a special occasion.
other Oregano's is my FAVORITE restaurant in all of Tempe! The food is delicious - I've never been disappointed by a single appetizer, entrée or desert! And since they've recently add Blue Moon beer on draft I could stay here on the patio all day. Bonus: The wait staff is incredibly fun and friendly. Just a really great place to dine!
other They have Veggie Dogs! The veggie dog will run you about 40 calories fewer than the regular turkey dog. Happy eating :)
other I have been here a couple of times as it is about a block from where I live. It is your typical neighborhood bar. That is, not a lot of people, average prices, okay happy hour.Their menu is bar food. Burgers, Wings, Fries, and so on. The have the standard domestics on tap (Bud, Coors, Miller etc).A lot of times they have live music at 9 or 10. If this is for you then you have the chance to see an exclusive performance since not a lot of patrons are there. However, it gets pretty loud. So if this does not sound like your thing, be aware what time it is. Service is pretty bad if you are in the "restaurant" part. The only time I have eaten at a table the bartender was also our server. Needless to say slow is an understatement. The only reason I go here is so I don't have to drive anywhere. other stars because I have experienced better, much better. My experiences tells e that the Waterfront is just a corner bar. Nothing Special.
other Both of the previous reviewers are correct, actually. Yes, there can be a line to the door at times, and not everyone working there is 100% nice 100% of the time. But who is? And, once you get to know them -- and are courageous enough to give them the benefit of the doubt -- everyone working there is very cool to deal with.Because this Post Office is tucked way back in the Foothills, it's not staffed as heavily as I've seen some others. But the remoteness of the location also means you get to breeze in and out on rare occasions too (seeing as this is too far out of the way for any non-Foothills residents). So, do like me: never go here in a hurry; be polite; be patient (it's not all about you). And you'll see this is really no worse than any other Post Office...and maybe even a little bit better.
other Great food, great atmosphere.  Look for the grafetti out back.  Not "Mexican food," but Mexico City cuisine.
3 I have to say I was slightly surprised when I went to the State Fair this year. Now I wouldn't go as far as saying I was impressed and it's a must for families or friends. My sister and I won free tickets to the fair and reserved seats for The Band Perry Concert off the radio and thought that was a good enough excuse to head that way. We got their around 5:30pm and it was relatively easy to find a somewhat secure parking spot (for $10). We went on a Wednesday so I imagine it wasn't as crowded as a weekend tournament, but this day happened to be a day where you could get in free if you bought three canned food items to donate to St. Mary's Food Bank. Good way to save on admission. I think I would be a little irked if I had to pay $10.00 to get in on top of cost for game/ride tickets and food and everything else. The other nice thing about going on a Wednesday is most of the games and rides are half the # of tickets or other tickets per game/ride (not all of them but the majority). Lines were short and you didn't have to wait much for anything. They sell some pretty strange fair food - I mean I can't even imagine eating fried butter, but I did have a fried Reese's Peanut Butter Cup which was pretty good. We went around 7:00 into the Veteran's Memorial Coliseum and it was easy to enter and pretty full once we got inside. We got moved to seats closer than our original section. This is a one time adventure for me and I am glad we went but the fact that it was pretty much free is what made it appealing.
other These guys are great!  They have helped me with bulbs needs for both my home and office.  Easy to work with and good prices.  Thanks!
other this was our first breakfast hit-up since we moved back, and gotta say it again....the protein pancakes are still da bomb. so lucious, cruchy yet soft, sweet yet salty, healthy but so much syrup...mmmm! go at an off time or you'll be knocking elbows with the elderly.
other For the past ten years (ever since FunSports occupied the same unit), this place has been the one-stop shop for my biking needs.  From BMX at age 13 to road cycling in adulthood, SMC usually has what I'm looking for.  The prices don't really compete with larger chains like Performance, but they are reasonable and the service more than makes up for the difference.  When I was getting into road cycling, the guys at the shop were very helpful with selection, fit, and pricing.  A+!
other LOVE Oregano's! They have delicious pizza, pasta, salads, wings, everything. The portions are huge and the prices are right and I can honestly say I've never not left Oregano's full and satisfied! Plus the atmosphere is fun as well. If you've saved room after your meal, try the pizookie, it's amazing. Giving other stars because there is always a huge wait and they don't take reservations or seat you until everyone is there, and also because the deep dish pizza was far too cheesy and saucy when I tried it (more than a deep dish should be) but everything else is superb.
other I had Smashburger for the first time a couple of days ago and I was not impressed. My burger was way too greasy. The smashfries were good but they were greasy as well. I'm not expecting for my burger to be dry but there is a major difference between juicy and greasy and they crossed over into the land of the grease. And they were heavy handed with the salt. Unless I want my sodium intake for the week in other day, I would suggest that they move away from the salt.They are similar to Five Guys in that they have no combos but they have more options. I can see what the appeal is and maybe the cook was having a bad day but between the grease and the salt I will not be going back unless I have a death wish.
3 Dammit - I have been here a dozen times and it's been so "mixed"... The best of times, and the worst of times... though the last two times (for late night drinking with friends) have been pretty fun... Drinks are cheap and the crowd is "lively".So, for now, I will suggest Dos Gringos to the college drunkard and/or professional drinker after 9pm. Bring some friends!
other I really wish I had a dagger to stab myself in the face for trying to eating here. Absolutely the WORST PLACE in the entire valley. I would turn around and go ask for my money back but I am to embarrassed to even be seen in the drive through again. Was on my way home, thought I would give it a shot. I ordered random items; chicken taco and onion rings. The taco was like eating out of a horse trough.. It fell apart immediately and I found myself trying to shovel it into my mouth. After about two bites I realized the meat was questionably chicken. The onion rings were so blah I didn't even touch them. Please do your self a favor.. Dig in the nearest dumpster for lunch, then go home and pound a bottle of vegetable oil. It sure beats the hell out of this joint. No joke.
other Sure, I'll pretend that the main reason I come here is the food and not the super cheap margaritas. It was the... uhh... food that is really good even if I don't remember what I ate. I think there were some fish tacos that were pretty tasty. Okay fine, I go for the margaritas- they are big, cheap and tasty.
3 From the outside the place looked alot busier however, Not a bad place to go for lunch on Friday afternoon. Especially when it's close to 1pm as the place was pretty empty. My coworker order brisket tacos and they came out stuffed with tons of brisket. She said they they were very good and I will take her word for it as they looked pretty tasty. Now me, I am not an enchilada person however the enchilada de avocado sounded pretty good as it had two of my favorites stuffed in in, avocado and artichoke. I must admit that it was pretty good. I only finished a little bit of it as I had filled up on the warm chips and salsa that was served when we sat down. Yum. So why only three stars? Well It's actually 3.other stars as although the food and the company were great, the service was a little off. Like I said the place was empty and yet our server either forgot about us at times or was busy doing something else in the back. Nicole, our server was sweet enough but still.... hmmm. Oh well no biggie. It was empty and we did get in and out in under an hour but not other star worthy. Will I be back again? Probably as the food was pretty good. Heck the chips and salsa alone are worth giving it another shot.
other Delicious, fresh, flavorful, with a lot of meat and vegetarian options to please any discerning palate.  They also offer soups and salads, which I hear are equally as delicious, and many different options for sides.  It's sad to see that this plaza, which used to house Michael's and several other stores, is now nearly defunct, and the last remaining vestiges of this plaza's prime days is this deli, Pong Pong Chinese food, which is right next door, and a few other specialty stores.My favorite so far is the Southwest wrap.  The Buena Bella vegetarian sandwich, though touted as a healthy alternative, seems to be a bit too salty to make it really that healthy for you.
other Fantastic donuts! Great selection! Coffee was definitely above average!
other This place is home.
other I love the Drybar at the Scottsdale Quarter, so when I saw a Groupon for the new Phoenix location, I bought it right away. The salon was very busy but I was seen right away. I received my champagne promptly and went to the washing station. The Groupon was good for a 10 minute floater (scalp massage), but I can't imagine mine was for more than other minutes. It was a nice bonus, but not something I'd pay for myself next time I visit. I have simple, short hair, so my blowout was pretty quick. The woman who did my hair did a great job of listening to what I wanted and was a lot of fun to talk to. I was in and out within 40 minutes. It only lasted about a day, so that was a bummer, but my hair stayed clean and fresh for four. Drybar is a step above other blow dry bars in the area - I highly recommend!
other How does this restaurant generate so many other and other star ratings? I know it was on the food channel, but honestly the food was sub-par. Maybe it was just an off day, but I have a feeling it wasn't. The prices were not outrageous, but it wasn't cheap either. The atmosphere was nice, if very cafeteria like.But the food was way way too "greasy." And bland. And my stomach now aches after eating there....
other Well my first review of Over Easy; have gone here a few times; only reason I don't go more often probably because of the wait. The food is definately makes me want to return.  The Hopple Popple, the Wolf  Pack, and what I had today, the Loco Moko (only criticism is the rice); great lemonade (when I used to drink lemonade) and the hash browns & they have tater tots!!! I'll be back; when I can get up early...
other My sweet hubby brought me here for my b-day the other night.  Note, this is a Scottsdale other star, otherwise known as a Chicago, California, or New York other star rating.  This may possibly be my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale.  Amazing food.  Unpretentious and cozy atmosphere.  Got the steak frites.  Asked for veggies instead of frites and ended up with steak green beans.  It was excellent.  We asked for a smooth red wine.  I had possibly my second best red wine ever.  We also ordered a scallop appetizer and the escargots.  Both were cooked almost to perfection - however lacking in salt for my personal preference, which is an easy fix.   I would definitely go back.  Don't recommend this for large parties.  However, it is the perfect place for smaller, intimate parties.
other Very delicious and friendly! They do happy hour every day which is so great! The sushi is always very delicious and the same with their entrees. I love how close this is to my house. We visit this place quite frequently!
other So when you walk in, walk to the right and have the machine scan your card. I'm telling you this because I looked like a douchebag because I assumed that the Bally worker would scan my card. Oh yeah, you'll smell urine. Like, did someone just go crazy and piss all over the place? Seriously, how does a smell get so horrendous like that? What is that? There are a lot of treadmills and they're recent...not new...they look overused...but yeah. I'm sensitive to smell... I couldn't even exercise.
other This place has really bad service and the food is barely decent, I would advise not to dine here. There are much better Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix.
other Brought my car here b/c of the reviews I read on yelp. My fan was running excessively. The mechanic came and looked at my car. The coolant was low. He grabbed a can and filled it up. No charge. I then told him I needed new struts. He quoted me a price that was cheaper than the one quoted to me in CO a few months ago. I honestly didn't shop around for a cheaper price here in Phoenix, which is unlike me. The reviews here, and fixing my fan problem at no charge had me sold. It seems so rare to find an honest mechanic now-a-days, especially in this economy.  Made an appt. Car was finished super quick, in the time frame that was promised. The mechanic went out of his way to show me the damage struts he replaced, then told me my new struts came with a lifetime warranty. Dang, did I time warp back into the 50s?  Hopefully I won't have a need to go back, but if I do, I'd gladly drive out of my way one hour round trip for their honesty again.
other Tommy V's is a delightful twist on old town dining where fine wines come with a surprisingly  refreshing price and food pairings  are always fresh and so delicious.  The atmosphere matches the name - just oh, so chic! and the staff is always very gracious!  We will return many times this summer with the new special app & entree deal too! When I set out to go to happy hour last week, I didn't expect Prince Edward Island Mussels and a most fantastic wine that our waiter recommended!Tommy V's has the recipe for success in good cuisine, wine, and ambiance!
other We stopped in for a snack between lunch and dinner and luckily caught some great HH specials!    The restaurant was virtually empty on a Friday around 3pm, but I didn't mind much as we were in a hurry.  We sat at the sushi bar and enjoyed the company of the chef.  The service was a little bit rock to start off as I think 3 different people tried to take our order, but once it got rolling- we were good to go. I had some Sea Bass Nigiri ($3 for other pieces), Spicy Tuna Roll ($3-4), Edamame ($1.50), and a wonderful house salad topped with sliced pears and a delicious house dressing ($3).  The fish was all very fresh and clean tasting, but the salad was honestly my favorite!
other Delicious yet again! Pho, garlic green beans, papaya salad...they can do no dish wrong. The owner, Justina, is hip, cool, gorgeous and awesome! It's BYOB so bring a nice wine or beer...no corking fee so don't forget to tip well!If you're eating and there's a big line of others waiting, please do what we do and go across the street to gelato so that other people don't have to wait an hour.
other We went there for dinner in April 2011. The dishes are hit and miss, and all are over priced. My wife ordered pad thai, and it was horrible. Instead of the traditional, flavorful dish with peanut and bean sprout, this dish at Flo's is just a salty, chicken noodle. My wife and I both took a bite, we had to send it back. It was not edible. Too salty. Only chicken and rice noodle. There was no peanut, no bean sprout, no pepper, no egg, no ..... Basically, it was NOT a pad thai at all. On the upside, my son ordered a sweet&sour chicken, and it was better than most places. They used fresh pineapples.Based on food quality, ambience, and dinner prices, I say there are tons of other places that are better.
other My awesome musician lovergirl wanted to bring me here specifically to see Nicole so we could have some kind of pianist bonding session. Unfortunately, she wasn't playing when we went, but I am thoroughly convinced that she is extraordinary. I ordered the sirloin steak salad and mushroom-brie soup. Our server was exceedingly friendly and helpful, and service was prompt. And the food! The soup was worth the visit in itself. It was creamy and mushroomy, and oh so delicious. The steak on my salad came out a little rarer than I would have preferred, but I still enjoyed it, and it was a huge portion at that. I love that my salad wasn't over-dressed, and I was definitely a fan of the candied walnut-blue cheese thing going on up in that sucker. So good.Besides the fact that they serve great bougey food, have incredibly witty and awesome wait staff, and sometimes have half-off bottles of wine, I totally fell for My Florist Cafe's atmosphere. We had a late dinner here, and the whole place was lit in cool blue. It felt very accessibly hip. This is a place I'd definitely come back to. You know... the next time I'm in Arizona. I'm actually very much inclined to visit the Ventura location, which is only about one hour from my home plate--as opposed to five.
other Does anyone know why their regular subs are $other more than all the other Jimmy John's? Or is that just when it's delivered, instead of charging a standard delivery fee? I've noticed that with the other types of sandwiches too, and extras...the slim is $other instead of $3.25, and extra avo is $1.7other instead of $0.75That's not going to stop me from ordering though :-) Still love their sandwiches...they make the best veggie sub I've had. They load it up with veggies, whereas I have to ask for extra everything at a certain other sub chain and then they still barely put any on. I'd much rather pay a little bit extra for Jimmy John's :-)
other I have been to this place many times and the food and service is always great. I am so excited to have found a place where I can get freshly made, good food out here in Queen Creek. My favorite is their home made mozzarella cheese. Its great on anything. I frequently order the tomato, basil and Mozzarella pizza and I recently discovered their vegetarian plate which was delicious. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is casual and comfortable. Don't forget to save room for the amazing ice cream they have.
other Summary: not impressed.Arrived early afternoon, ironically maybe that was the problem - there wasn't enough going on, place was dead. I would have hoped that a restaurant manager would realize that the few customers they may have at a slow time are just as important as those on a Friday night rush - standards are standards, you either have them or you don't.Waitress was pleasant but not attentive - with a total of 3 occupied tables had to get up and get her attention for more chips. Chips though were very good; needed hotter salsa.My friend had the steak fajitas; tasted OK but just luke warm. Fajitas are supposed to be sizzling hot; duh.I had a so-so tamale and chicken enchilada. Enchilada was just warm, mostly a flat layer of cheese. Tamale filling was tasty shredded meat (as it should be) but corn meal was barely warm and almost tasted only partially cooked. Refried beans weren't warm enough to even melt the grated cheese sprinkled on top, which consequently then pulled off in a single congealed mass when I took a bite. Finally, the Cadillac margaritas were just average at best. $50 plus tip for two meals plus two margaritas; not worth it.The place looked promising and has a cute patio area but we won't be back - someone's not watching the store. I'm trying to be generous with the two stars as some other Yelpers seem to like this place; maybe things can get better.
other What can I say about this place? I love it. Its straight up the road from my place. You can find everything here, not just Asian food. When I get a hankering for Bombay spice, off to Lee Lee I go. I love LOVE their meat counter. I get chills deciding which pork hocks I want. The fish fry service is nice. They have stuff I can't live without and can't find anywhere else i.e. aloe vera juice and those sinfully delicious dessert rice and of course, the makoks. The cashiers can be a lil raunchy though just smile and nod. And a little known secret? The vegetables are freshest on Fridays.
other Sandwiches are very above average in taste, but they are on the spendy side.
other Ok, I have been coming to Wong's Place for a number of years now. I found this little gem when I was wandering about Tempe (No I am not homeless, nor do I wander off when I drink) ;)Anyhow, the majority of the time that I order the food to go, it is really good. I have had only a few issues with the rice for the sizzling rice soup being overcooked but I will say that the soup is awesome and tastes awesome (Three flavor). Wong-Jo chicken is good with egg fried rice, egg foo yung, house deluxe chow mein, imprerial three delights, mongolian beef (not a huge portion, but tasty), and random other tastyness!! They have not updated the decor and everytime that I come in to get my order, I converse with the guy that always takes my order. He is not The Mr. Wong, but he is like his right hand man. He recently told me that they have not fired any of their workers because everyone has been working there for over 10 years. Even in this economy when business is OK at best, they take care of their people. I hope this place never closes down or I will be sad for them, and hard pressed to find anyone who can mirror the sizzling rice soup and wong-jo chicken. It is a typical chinese restaurant but I think the food is better than most chinese knock-off restaurants. I think that if you can enjoy the authentic atmosphere and the food (pink menu if you are scared of authentic chinese), then you should be satisfied with your meal. Personally, I get mine to go 99% of the time because I will take it home and not feel bad when I load my plate up with everything and go back for seconds!!
other I've practiced yoga for years at At One Yoga and initially wasn't happy about their merger with LifePower. But now, after several months of going to LifePower, I think it's pretty nice. The facility is big and clean and very well kept. If you want to use the entire facility (the weights and machines) you have to sign up for a monthly contract. However, if you just want to take the yoga classes, you can buy them packages of ten classes. The ten classes can be used over any length of time. I like that because if I'm out of town or busy, my class package doesn't expire. I do wish they offered more class packages, like in groups of 2other or 50 classes, the the way At One Yoga used to do. Because typically the more classes you buy, the bigger the discount. The great majority of the yoga instructors from At One Yoga have come over to teach at LifePower. I've taken yoga classes in several places throughout the US and I think these yoga teachers are among the best in the country.
other This review is for the chain in general. The location we went to is new so it isn't in Yelp yet. Once it is I will put this review there as well. We were there on Friday at other PM. The reason I gave it other stars is because the burger was very good and it was made the way I asked for it. My husbands burger was not.But, the server and the fries left a lot to be desired. Let me preface by saying that we had been to several other locations. I like my fries crispy. I ask for them well done, extra crispy, scorched, tortured hollow tubes. Whatever their buzz word is for well done. The location will comply. EVERY OTHER other GUYS HAS COMPLIED. But not the one at TATUM AND SHEA. She said that corporate said they are not to cook the fries that way. So if we were to put up with soggy fries - yes soggy, then we did not want them. She also interrupted us several times which is rude. THEN she went and called corporate just to double check for us and she came to the table and said they said no they were not to cook them that way. Seriously? We did not ask for her to do this. She actually accused us of being undercover shoppers. We started to say something and then again- she interupted.Listen, if you explain that our choice is not how the company wishes to present their product and we still choose to have them a different way, you should comply. It is after all our money and our decision. I was raised with the rules that #other the customer is always right. And #other if the customer is wrong REFER TO RULE NUMBER 1!!We will not return. They have lost our business and I hope she loses her job.If you want to try a really good burger AND FRIES place- go to Paradise Valley Burger Company at 40th Street and Bell. You will not be disappointed.
other I used to go here about once a week when I still lived and worked in Arizona. My office at the time was within walking distance.This is a very good Hooters location...located smack dab in the middle of Mill Avenue right next to ASU. Plenty of stores all around. I used to go mainly for lunches during the week with co-workers. It usually was quieter than evenings or weekends. The serving staff were great and many of the ladies would stand and chat for quite a while...as it was pretty slow.
other This restaurant is in my TOP-other favorite restaurants of all-time!  ...The only reason I am not giving it 5-stars is because it is a real splurge, and it takes a pretty special occasion (and experience) to justify such an expensive meal.While in my personal experience at Posh, the quality (and "deliciousness") of the food I had definitely justifies the price-tag, it should - if the quality wasn't extraordinary, it wouldn't rank at all.You really do have to be an open-minded, mostly omnivorous eater to fully appreciate it though.  If there are ingredients or flavors that you don't much care for, it might be more challenging to assume that you will like everything you get.  It can be daunting, because you may get something that you don't like, but that is also part of the excitement (and the adventure of trying new things!)  You also may get something that you've never had done well before and find that you are a newly converted fan.  Also, though the wine parings are wonderful, if you are on a budget, skipping the wine is a good way to trim the bill.For the best experience, don't go when you are famished, and don't bring picky eaters with you - both will interfere with you having a completely satisfying experience.
other I heart Harkins. Have for years. Love the loyalty cups & t's.
3 So I went here twice and I hated it the first time.  I don't know if I got a bad cut of meat or what, but my burrito was a bit too fatty.  I think it was the red chile burrito, or something.Having said that, I recently gave it another shot and and went for the carne asada burrito.  Very, very good.  The cut of the beef is a little thicker than the usual Salazar's or Filiberto's burrito, but it was really good regardless.  Oh, and the beans in there were awesome, too.  It didn't have guacamole and I didn't notice till it was too late, but I'll be sure to get some in there next time.Overall, I give it 3 stars because i really hated my first visit, but their carne asada is completely legit.
other I have been going to Physical Therapy for several weeks working on Plantar Faciatis (ripped tendons in the foot), I was not getting enough massage to make much progress, I switched to Massage N You and they focused on my calves and now we are making good progress on healing.  They had the right touch, pressure and listened to what I needed.   Going back for more...
3 On an evening walk through Roosevelt row during the monthly First Friday event, I overheard what could only be Jazz funk pouring out from the door just up the way. I walked by and someone sitting out front invited us in for a listen to their free music event. Once inside, the wife and I were greeted by the snack bar ladies asking us if we would like one of their cookies, candies or sodas in the bottle; we got a diet coke for a $1. The Nash a decent sized venue with about 1other or so four seat tables to sit at, none of which are particularly better than another, with the tables in front being the only exception. The music was good, if you like Jazz music as I do, but I think the band playing this night put together an oddly slow paced set with more of a blues and 'experimental' Jazz than I would have liked to hear. From the amount of people walking out during their set, seemed like others also harbored the same opinion. I usually like my jazz with a little side of funk; a thick base line, Jazz guitar, and complimentary piano and horn of some type. We stuck around for about other songs and decided to move on. It was First Friday after all.This place could really use some Kool, and maybe even the Gang. I imagine the music is subjective and changes on an event by event basis. I feel they really could step up the quality of foods, snacks, and drinks. The venue seemed more like it catered towards a teenaged crowd, especially considering their food choices were chips, candies, etc, and no adult beverages in sight. Although I can't see many teenagers running out to listen to a night of Jazz, I could be wrong though.If I find that someone worth listening to is playing at The Nash, I will likely head out again; but I don't think I would plan on just dropping in randomly for an evening of Jazz.Happy Yelping Phoenix. I can't get enough of that funky stuff!
other Warning: Douche Bag level CODE RED!Here's how my experience went ... Me: "May I have a Carmel Latte?" Employee: "No".... dead air ...Me: "Ummm why not?"Employee: "We don't have carmel"Me: "Ummm I guess I'll just have a Cappuccino then"Employee: "Just so you know it's a REAL Cappuccino"Me: "Okay" (in my head I'm trying to figure out if I can legally punch this dickhead in the face or not).So I sat down mulling over this experience in the dank dark atmosphere while listening to this ass wipe talk to his friend about living on other peoples couches for the past few months and about how he'll be moving to downtown Phoenix soon. To which I just chuckled to myself as this person was FAR from cool enough to blend into CenPho. What a complete and utter douche bag. Stay in Tempe poser (and keep your employer there to!).This experience was months ago, and now they have opened up a shop downtown. Guess what? I'm not going to check them out. Fuck you Cartel. You'll never be Lux, so just stay in Tempe where you can be a complete poser with an attitude that you haven't earned.Complete FAIL. For my two cents, skip this place and go to Lux in CenPho/Mid Town right off the Light Rail. Authentically cool with ZERO attitude, great coffee and no douche bag employees. And as for great coffee ... try Conspire WAY better coffee and authenticly cool.---- please read "owners comment" below ... here's my response ... ----Wow so the coffee snobbery continues with the owner ... I guess my new job  should be to "promote good coffee in Arizona" ... and I don't appreciate good coffee because I enjoy the combination of caramel AND coffee ... By that definition I guess I don't know good ice cream because I like hot fudge on it or good pizza because I enjoy pepperoni AND cheese or good music if it's not acoustic or a good voice unless it's A cappella ... thanks for proving my point. I wouldn't go here unless you are a total coffee snob ... (I guess) they don't need your business you poser!
other We were visiting Scottsdale from Carlsbad, CA.  Came here with my husband and teenage son.  We each ordered something different and none of us really liked the food.  The tortillas served with the soup are the same served at Taco Bell.  The entre plates are a huge blob of reheated beans and rice. The saving grace was the sopa pillas.  I feel we wasted $7other for an unimpressive dinner and wouldn't recommend coming here.
other Stopped in last night for a take out dinner. I wanted to bring home something different than burgers or a pizza or fried chicken. So I used my Yelp app.... And showed Yusefs nearby with good reviews.The owner was a very personable person....and very helpful. Everything smelled wonderful, and it was pretty busy....all good signs.I order other of the falafel dinner plates, and the stuffed grape leaves plate. The only "side" for a dinner plate was the split pea soup. It was a generous portion....and VERY GOOD!The falafel and grape leave were both generous portions....and delicious!I want to go back a do a little grocery shopping for some of the unique items that I think you could find only in Phoenix here.Good job Yusef! I liked it!
3 I was not impressed. For a business traveler, there are better choices nearby. When I drove up, the valet told me there was no self park, but I could see it less than 100 yards away from my room. I used it during my stay, and it was convenient and much less expensive. The entry of the hotel was constantly blocked by party goers, and I couldn't find any alternate entrance/exit. My bill was wrong at checkout. They adjusted it, but then mysteriously placed an additional unauthorized charge of $13.9other on my credit card. Seriously wishing I opted for Embassy Suites across the road...
other This is my favorite breakfast & lunch place in Ahwatukee. The food is excellent. The service is friendly and they do what they do perfectly. This isn't a place to go for elegant sit down service. It's the perfect blend of self-service meets top restaurant quality food. Have the Croque Monsieur--or add an egg to make it a Croque Madame. You will not be disappointed. The bread and the baked goods are so good you could make a substantial meal off them alone.Finally, this is a small local business that truly cares about its community. They have shown up at two community fund raising events with huge boxes of warm, freshly baked cookies to donate. I'm grateful to have a place of this caliber in my neighborhood.
3 It is important to point out that Blue Adobe Grill is not a Mexican restaurant, it is a New Mexican restaurant. While that may seem to be an unnecessary clarification, it is actually fairly important to keep in mind as you visit. For a New Mexican joint, it is pretty dang good and true to the region, but food a sit-down Mexican joint it would be disappointing. In order to maintain full disclosure, it has been a couple of years since I went here last, but it has been around for years so I can't imagine much has changed. Overall I would recommend it to people who don't have expectations of a certain type of food. It's good but nothing memorable.
3 I see one word come up again and again in the reviews for this place: "Cute".Well, it is cute. The lighting and furniture and concept are happy, kind and appealing in an innocent way. The patio is cute, too.And it's not Applebee's. Oftentimes I'll be with a group of people trying to decide where to eat and drink. Someone will say "Applebee's at Central and Camelback". There will be groans. Then someone will think of Maizie's across the street and the response is "well, it's not Applebee's". Then we go there.Aside from that, ummm . . . well . . . . .
other Only other stars? (A few notes: The folks that rated this place low must have been isolated incidences and I feel weigh far to heavy on service rather than product. Dining at a restaurant, rate the service a lil' harder, but a coffee shop, hold your tongue.)Anyway, this place rocks. We aren't super close, but we pass up several coffee shops en route to Lola because the quality is top drawer.The beans, fair trade, and the roast is perfect. The price of a bag of beans is amazing. Doing right by the farmers and then respecting the product with such a solid roast. This is what is all about!I have yet to find a better americano. A splash of cream and a splenda only augments the flavor of the espresso and the richness really shines. I've been to most of the independent coffee shops throughout the area, and if I do find myself elsewhere, I can only compare them to Lola, and Lola wins out each time.
other I love minimalism.  If you can class up a place with a less-is-more approach, then you've exceeded the abilities of 95% of the American population.  Fortunately for the Cen Pholks Lisa G has this aptitude that transcends through her decor and into her simplistic, but delicious organic food.Now, here's my deal: you put prosciutto on your menu and and I'm gonna get b-boy on your hardwood floors like Ozone in Breakin' 2.  Lisa G's breakbeats the hell out of their prosciutto sandwich with caramelized onions, parm cheese, fig jam, and arugula on an Italian loaf.  A side of balls and their Alamos Ridge Malbec and I'm fresh.Service?  Never had a bad experience, but who cares?  The food outshines any flaws of a young dine-in.
other What a great place to hike/ run/ shred! It's a great hike to shake up the routine with.  A steep hike with bits of scrambling to a summit with amazing views. The only downside is there's mad crowds of people snaking their way up and down the hill. I feel for humanity sake I must pass on some words of advice. 1) If you need to pass- Just say "Excuse Me" or "On your left/right" or, if those don't work, "Can I pass?" Don't frustrate yourself and huff and puff behind someone because they can't interpret your grunts. 2) The railing sections. Yes, it's steep but if you see someone running down using the railing and trying to go fast- LET GO and let them pass. There's this thing called gravity and it will keep you firmly on this earth. Trust me you're not going to fly off into space nor topple over backwards. Then you can grab the railing and pull yourself up if that's what you need to do. 3) I can't believe I have to mention this- DON'T FREAKIN' SMOKE on the trail. Apparently there are some who can't savor life's moments without puffing on a cigarette. But if I see you smoking as I hike this thing I will be forced to kick you in the shins. I can't help it it's what happens when I inhale second hand smoke. 4) Your trash does not add to the ambiance. Pack out what you take in. This includes dog owners. Pick it up. Nothing will decompose because this is a desert. Just sayin' 5) Finally, sometimes in life when we arrive to our destination and find the parking lot full one must consider finding other options. Yeah, you in the SUV waiting with the engine running for a spot at the nearest stall to the trail head. Park down the road and walk up. Ridiculous. Happy Hiking!
other Anyone who asks, "are you a vegan to lose weight?" should come to Green and eat their words. And everything else.In fact, I usually end up at Green with non-vegetarian friends because they claim that it's "Food you can eat that I actually like." Every dish is addictive, flavorful, saucy, and filling. Classic hits include the chicken thai peanut bowl, the singapore tofu bowl (although the mock meats are a shame to miss out on), the vegan BBQ chicken sammich (I just watched a carnivorous friend down this with the delight and voracity of a young velociraptor), and then there are the eternally awesome specials.Even though you'll probably be stuffed post-meal... make room for dessert. It's mind over matter anyway. Order a Tsoynami - they're like McFlurries with vegan ice cream and epic swirl ins. Standouts include Tsoynamis  filled with anything from frozen chocolate fudge, bananas, kitkats, hazlenut brittle, mint oreos and more.On a another note, this is also the only strictly vegan restaurant in the Tempe/Scottsdale area with a lively, hip atmosphere. Even if you love steak more than anything in the world (and there are steak po'boys, might I add) at least stop by for a chocolate chip cookie and check out the awesomeness of the place.
other Pleasantly surprised about the cleaniness of the location, the friendliness of the baristas and just the overall atmosphere. Reminds me of a small town cafe with the general coffee condiments centered for easy access. Drinks were made to order and have never failed to keep satisfied! Just need to get a drive through and all will be perfecto!
3 When we lived in AZ, my biggest regret was not coming here. I've always wanted to try it.Doing our road tripping this week, I was able to. Parking was easy for a weekday...we went in - through the wrong door. Oops. The server who was stocking things seemed surprised, but rolled with it. She said we could sit anywhere we wanted (we were a party of three). We chose a table for 6 so we could spread out a little and not be so squished. She immediately snapped, "Not that - it's for 6 people." I almost said, "Then don't tell us we can sit wherever we want..." I refrained. That surly girl nearly spoiled it, but luckily our server saved the day.I saw the hot dog...you know, the 2other inch insane monster on the menu. I split it with my friend. We didn't even finish it. It was delicious, if a bit salty. I knew it was a salt overload because in under an hour my fingers were swollen. :( Oh salt, why must I love you yet be so affected by you?We didn't finish it, but definitely enjoyed it. If I get this again when in town, I'll get it plain and still split it with a friend.
other When I met some friends for dinner at this restaurant at the end of October, I liked it so much that I made a mental note to write something later.   I've just signed onto Yelp, and this is my first review.Our group of friends hadn't seen each other for a while.   Busy catching up, we didn't open our menus for quite a while.  I was impressed that our waitress (her name might be Mel) kept coming back in the nicest way to check on us, but didn't interrupt our conversation.   She kept letting us know that she was ready when we were.  When we were finally ready to order, she asked:  "Separate checks?"   Terrific.  That was exactly what we needed.I hadn't expected to like the food, because I had heard and read that it was all the  high-calorie "comfort" variety.   It was a nice surprise that I was able to get low-calorie substitutions for the sides that went with my entree.Overall, it was a very nice experience.
other The sushi was fresh and excellent! The service was almost too fast. I did not find the prices to be out of line with the quality.  Our daughter loved the miso soup. The one thing I really appreciated is that they will make what you want, whether it is on the menu or not. If they have it, you can get it. I know we'll be going there often. One thing though, this is a busy, noisy place. It is not large either. If you are looking for quite and relaxed, this perhaps isn't the best choice. If you want good food in a noisy cheerful atmosphere, like a bunch of friends or after work, this fits the bill.
other We recently had a pleasure trip to AZ and I booked at the Fairmont Princess and I must say I made an AWESOME choice! - Room was I guess a standard King but it was so large and spacious with a couch and seating area as well as a very comfortably appointed bath and patio. The decor looked fresh and new as well. Very contemporary. Lovely. We were in building C and overlooked the rose/aroma garden which was quite quiet and pretty. Might have been a little better to overlook the lagoon with the firey fountain but we were pleased none the less.- Pools were the best. We swam in the main south pool, the east pool and used the slides the kids area as well. Did a lot of night swimming as it was hot and gotta tell you...night swimming rules! We rarely get to do where I live.- Restaurants and bars were very good...if a bit pricey...as well. We had dinner at Bourdon Steak by Michael Mina which was very tasty and nice ambiance. Ate at Hacienda Restaurant and also at the bar at an outside table. Kinda liked eating at the bar better. Yum of the drinks. - Great trip....great place...we will be back!
other If you like a good burger then check this place out. They have so many options that you can choose from to make your own burger. I am usually not a fan of sweet potato fries, but these ones come with a dipping sauce that is amazing.
3 Beyond the attractive decor and nice food-presentation, I wasn't all that impressed by True Food. Certainly the concept of healthy, sustainable, locally bought food is great (albeit in the form of an upscale-chain), but overall, True Food didn't live up to the hype.On the positive side, the edamame dumplings with daikon radish and white truffle oil were extremely tasty, and my Ginger Margarita was excellent. On the not-so-positive side, the raw ahi tuna app-special was just OK, and the tiny slivers of fish (maybe 8 total?) were more of a "taste" than a full appetizer. Even worse, my chicken sausage pizza was slightly burnt on the bottom, and tasted bland and uninspired -- the sausage was finely ground and lacked much flavor, and the fennel was invisible. Added to the long wait (weekend dinner reservations are a must even though the restaurant is huge) and the pay-parking lot (if you stay more than two hours, which we did because of the long wait), we all came away mildly disappointed.With many other excellent Phoenix-area restaurants to choose from, we'll head elsewhere next time.
other Joe's Farm Grill features everything that is All-American. Burgers, pizzas, salads, hot dogs, and a variety of other classics, each with their own twist. I was pleasantly surprised that Sonoran Dogs were on the menu (I rarely see them outside of Tucson). I got a burger that was gigantic and yummy--don't forget to ask for grilled onions. There are a number of novelties in each of Joe's restaurants, but my favorite part about this one is that it is nestled right next to farmland. The ingredients here touted to be fresh and local, and I could definitely taste the difference in my burger and especially in the fruit cup.I took my brother here for his birthday; he got a 4B and looved it. He wasn't able to complete the trifecta but there will always be next year!
other Wow, I am kinda suprised by the recent reviews of this place. My girlfriend loves this place and has been going for the past 5+ years. She would probably give it other stars. I really like this place, the atmosphere, we always get great service. The food is really, really good and the prices aren't bad. Sometimes, very crowded, but haven't ever waited too long. We love going back and can't wait till our next visit.
other Well, this place is as good as it gets. Family owned and awesome. You know how at some mexican places the beans and rice are an afterthought? Not here. They are the best I have ever had, yes even in mexico. The food is seasoned perfectly and the service is exceptional. Too bad they are closed Sundays. The queso is the best I have ever had. I could keep going but you get the picture. Go there, order and eat, you will not be disappointed.
3 Hello my fellow Arizonians.....My review gets 3 stars but I really should give it 2... I am being generous.I will start....as always, by saying I am the pickiest person I know and although food is a preference.... I know what I like! We went on a Saturday around noon and it was packed!  There were several larger tables open but nothing to accomodate other people so being the outgoing person I am, I invited a couple people to join us so we could take a larger table.What a great way to meet people, and they were great tablemates!The food is good, I only have a couple CONS....No low sodium soy sauce and most of the food is VERY salty!The selection is not great, no calamari or bbq pork and several other items I enjoy.The only dim sum restaurant I have experienced out here is C FU Gourmet,,, their selection is greater but their downfall is the food is usually cool to warm and the place has been steadily getting worse. (bummer) and the owner just doesnt seem to care.If you enjoy Dim Sum...I reccomend you give it a shot and see what you think.And until then.............Bon Appetite'
other I went to Saba's feeling a little scared.  Fast food Greek in a strip mall?  This could go one of two ways...surprisingly good or health code violation bad.  I am very glad to say it didn't end being the latter.  In fact, the food here was pretty damn good.  I did expect Saba's to be an order at the counter joint, so I was a little disappointed to see it was actually a tiny restaurant.  I like my Greek fast and cheap, okay?  But I got over it, got a table and began the interminable wait for our server to stop chatting with other diners and take our order.The menu has all the normal Greek items, including falafel- little fried balls of joy I might add- gyros, vegetarian platters, spanakopita and dolmas.  Prices for the sandwiches and gyros are pretty cheap, but when you venture into the platter territory, you're going to pay for it. Platters start around $10 and go up.  I ordered the falafel, of course, and so did my boyfriend.  The pita sandwiches don't come with any sides, so we ordered a basket of fries to go along with our meal.The dcor was pretty cool with big pictures of Greece all over the walls and the classic Greek music piped in.  Unfortunately, not even the Greek music could mask the hideous, loud tool of a diner that was sitting at the table in front of me. He was one of those idiots that has to talk so loud, even the half-deaf cook in the kitchen can hear him.  He was so loud I felt like I should respond to his questions.  Hey moron- saying things like "I like it loose, like my women," is just not funny.Anyways, when we finally got our food, it was really good.  The falafel pita and the fries were tasty, but our server sucked.  He obviously knew the loud tool, and kept chatting with him while we waited for our check.  That was a little annoying, but overall, Saba's is a good choice for a quick Greek meal.
other This is one of those reviews where a qualifier is required.  It seems like everybody that gives this transit system a good rating is a Phoenix native.  That makes this, like so many other things, good for Phoenix.  The problem is that it's terrible compared to nearly every other metro system in North America and absolutely abysmal compared to more progressive parts of the world.This is quite possible the slowest train that I have ever ridden in my life.  It seems to make stops every two blocks and it take far too long to get anywhere.  Factor in the terrible hours of operation and you're going to easily find yourself stranded at one end or the other after a night at the bar.Please work on expanding the routes and hours, speeding up the trains and then maybe you'll be able to increase ridership.  I'm a huge fan of mass transit but this train falls far short of expectations.
other I lived in Chandler for almost two years and used this gym almost daily.  It is never that crowded, even on a Saturday morning or a later afternoon gym run. The machines sometimes aren't all working, but there is a maintenance guy there often. I like how the cycles are available in the empty aerobics room if there isn't a class going on.  The weights and weight machines are pretty decent and again, not that crowded most of the time.  The staff at this location are the friendliest (IMO) among the other 2other Hour Fitness locations in the valley. The front desk people are always saying hello and the manager is friendly too.  Many of the Group X classes are a lot fun. I miss when the true yogi yoga instructor taught there. Her classes were amazing.  Some of the personal trainers I would never ask to purchase sessions from. One of them walks like he is too cool for school and I attended a boot camp led by some of the male trainers, and it became a competition between two of them on who could do ladders the fastest.  The female trainers and some of the male trainers look competent and their training sessions don't look so cookie-cutter-like, as the rest of the trainers. The location of this gym is not in the best area of the city, although decent. When I used to go here, I'd buy groceries at the WalMart there after.
other I have been to every ballpark in the Cactus League and know my way around them all.  This is, by far, the best facility in all of Spring Training (that includes the Florida parks).  Granted, I am a Dodger fan and we get it better than the 'Sox fans do, but it is still amazing.Camelback Ranch is the brand new, state of the art, spring training facility for the Dodgers and White Sox.  The Sox moved from Tucson because Tucson is the literally SO bad that even people from CHICAGO won't stay there.  The park is located just south of the Glendale Airport and pretty much only has one way in or out - 111th Ave.  You can avoid Camelback Rd by taking Indian School to 111th and then just drive into the stadium.The grounds feature 13 practice fields and a giant lake and river that also help irrigate the fields.  While the White Sox practice fields and clubhouse entry are blocked off from the public, the Dodgers' are wide open and inviting.  Players must walk through the crowds during practices which invited lots of interaction with the fans.  The field is beautiful and the layout of the stadium is quite impressive.  Not only do they have a full Jumbotron but they also feature fully enclosed suites and a full buffet for those willing to shell out $90 per game.  That price gets you seats behind home, access to unlimited food, wine, beer, soda, and sweets.  It also gets you exclusive merchandise as well as cold towels to help you cool off.  It sounds like a lot but it turns out to be worth the money.The grass seats have a great slope to them (much like Scottsdale) and the seat aisles are wide.  The food selection is lacking without Dodger Dogs, however.  The stadium is also missing the independent food vendors that Maryvale and Peoria feature.  A great stadium and surely one to visit every March.
3 I like Bungalow because its a great starting point for a night in Old Town Scottsdale. Centrally located, any other watering hole is in short walking distance, keeping the options open. Making this bar/grill the main location for your night out might pose some problems:-the drink prices are mediocre at best, so don't expect to be frugal.-the staff aren't anything special.-I didn't even know they served food, so it can't be better than average.-unless you can drop a pretty penny (and look the part) don't expect any good conversation.I can appreciate what this establishment is good for though. Bungalow offers a nice atmosphere to sit and converse with friends (not many locations in Old Town offer the ability to hear normal conversation)...
other Yummm. Love The Lady is A Scampi.. it's all I ever seem to order from this place. Can't get myself to stray. HUGE shrimp, pasta i perfect and full of flavor. As for everything else.. service was spot on, wait was only 30 minutes on a Friday night which is unheard of. One complaint.. ordered a dirty martini and there was no olive garnish :( But if that's the only problem..we're in pretty good shape.
other I am a huge fan of Chipotle but I will never come back to this location. The staff looks miserable and are SLOW. The cashier decided she would rather clean tables then ring people up so we waited for her to come back. Most of the tables were already clean so she could of waited to clean. The rice was crunchy like it wasn't cooked all the way and the steak was really chewy. Never again!
other Oh my mouth-watering BBQ goodness. Ignore the sketchy neighborhood and 30 minute wait, because the meal is worth it! My boyfriend's favorite food is BBQ-anything so I left the ordering up to him (and the choice was easy): Whole Hog Heaven - other meat choices plus 3 sides. Settling on St. Louis and Baby Back Ribs, BBQ Chicken, and Brisket, with sides of mac & cheese, coleslaw, and beans - he was as giddy as a kid on Christmas. I was pretty hungry too - and I had to admit the smell of BBQ wafting through the back kitchen door had my taste buds excited. The meal did not disappoint to say the least. The ribs were literally falling off the bone, the chicken was cooked perfectly, and the brisket was melt-in-your-mouth tender. All 3 sides were the perfect addition, however I do have to say that the coleslaw was my favorite, especially paired with the brisket. What sent us over the edge of BBQ heaven were the extra special additions before and after the meal. To start us off - homemade, warm cornbread with whipped butter. To finish us off - complimentary mini donuts (yes, you heard me right).Erg I would give other stars, but there was a hoard of drunken girls taking over the bathroom (there is a club attached to the restaurant?) that I found fairly annoying. Oh well.Highly recommended and we will be going back!
other I called The Town Dump to ask if I could come in this week and interview them for an English paper about a small local business, and the owner was just incredibly rude. She didn't even let me finish telling her it would take five minutes of her time, preferring to interject and tell me to go somewhere else. When I explained that I've heard wonderful things about their business from friends, and that that sparked my interest, she said, "Well, go somewhere else."I've never even been inside, and I sure as hell won't go now. Maybe it's just me, but I don't like shopkeepers who snarl at their customers.
other Alright, well seeing as I work right next door, my mouth has been watering over this place ever since I laid eyes upon the menu. And tonight, we finally had some yummy Rumbi take-out.First things first: they're a little pricey, at first glance. However, their portions are *enormous*. Each of us ordered a full size bowl(Honey Orange Shrimp for me, Jamaican Jerk Kalua Pork for Jamie, Honey Orange Kalua Pork and Teriyaki Chicken for Jamie's parents). The full size bowls were more than enough to last the average person through dinner, and then through lunch the next day; packed full of rice/noodles, meat, and veggies, with each bowl containing a ramekin of sweet teriyaki sauce.The shrimp in my bowl was perfectly tender and succulent, the Honey Orange sauce sweet, but not cloyingly so. The bowl came with a lime wedge, which added the perfect zing to the mellow coconut "Rumbi rice".We also ordered some of their Bahama Mama's Tortilla Soup, which was a creamy coconut-based broth filled with chunks of grilled chicken, tortilla strips, and melty mozzarella. It was a good, cozy soup, but could have benefited from more depth--some tang, some spice, something.For dessert, we had some of Rumbi's Key lime pie--moist, rich, and delectably sweet with a lovely measure of sour. Only complaint? The graham cracker crust was too mushy, soft, and crumbly; it would have been much better with a crispy bed under the pillowy-ness of the Key lime filling.All in all? Great place with reasonable prices, given their generous portions. They have a TON of salad options, as well, each more inventive than the last, and I'll be returning to try and test each one :)
other Great place to go have a beer and watch the game on one of there numerous televisions.
other A group of four of us went last night for the first time. I had purchased a Groupon, and was excited to check out a new winery. The service when we arrived was dismal. It took a tour leader from another group to flag someone's attention. We had reservations yet they acted surprised to see us. Given all this, if the wine had been great, we could have forgiven the service...it was not great. I don't expect the wine to be of Napa or Sonoma quality, but at least make up for it with your service.Disappointing, and I'll stick to other local wine bars moving forward. I honestly can't believe this place has an average of other stars...
other The Phoenix metro area is definitely not known for authentic Asian cuisine. China Magic Noodle House, however, is the real deal. This place reminds me of the Taiwanese delis that I used to go to in LA, as well as noodle houses that I've frequented in Taipei.They have a great selection of cold noodle, hot noodle and soup noodle dishes. And, a variety of ways to have your noodles (I typically order the thick noodles or shaved noodles). There's always a veggie on the whiteboard to try and the fried tofu is very tender and tasty with the dipping sauce.If you're looking for a reasonably priced, ethnically authentic meal in Phoenix (especially the East Valley), China Magic Noodle House should be near the top, if not first, on your list. the only negative that I would have about this place is that there isn't enough choices where chicken is the main protein.
other This review is slightly bias, seeing that I was in the press box. This park is very nice. Has ample parking and a ton of restaurants in the area for before or after the games. The food in the stadium is typical overpriced stadium food. I had the chicken teriyaki bowl for $7. The vendors are comical (you will hear the lemonade guy from across the stadium). I'd definitely see another game here in the future.
other This place is great.  The B.B.Q sauce has a nice little kick to it.  I tend to get the brisket sandwich with a side of potato salad.  Im not a big fan of the macaroni salad because it taste to picklelish,  The seasoned fries are also good.  My cousins usually get the pulled pork.  They seem to love it.  Mind you, this place is a hole in the wall.  Very small with minimal sitting area (other small tables).  The food is good but frankly it is a little expensive.  But  just a little.
other Best Thai food!!!  Order the dry garlic chicken.
other Sorry Jesse had such a bad experience here.  I have been using this place for about, well,  from the week they opened as it is so close to my office.They have never lost or damaged any of my clothing, and I drop my wife's delicate stuff off here as well for dry cleaning.  They have also always been true to their word on when I can pick up my clothes - although I am usually days late on the pick-up (one benefit of being a clothes-horse I guess). Two doors down from Dunkin, so fantastic to drop and pick the rags and then grab a cup o'joe before hitting the office.  The women who work there aren't too hard on the eyes, either, which is always a plus.Hard to believe they are still using a dot matrix printer, but that has no impact on service.
other I lived off Salazar Bros my first year of college because I lived right near it.  Must have eaten there twice a week minimum.  I was heartbroken when it turned into Armando Bros because as much as people told me they just changed their name, they didn't.  It was a different restaurant.  I had written it off as another great place gone to the pages of history until I moved near 48th and Baseline, and 'lo and behold there was Salazar's, tucked away in the Fry's parking lot next to a Little Caesars and a clothing outlet that appears to have escaped from the mall.  The interior itself is cheaply thrown together and completely forgettable.  The only thing the employees seem to care about is making food.  And none of this bothers me because they make some damn amazing food for cheap prices.I recommend the adobada burrito with extra sour cream and other things of red sauce.  It's pork brushed with a delicious sauce of some sort.  Comes with pico and guacamole.  I sometimes have to convince myself to try something new off the menu.  Brownie points for carrying Pepsi products as well, I take Mountain Dew with my burritos.
3 I've been there twice. Only a girl serve the table. If there are too many people,you have to wait for a long time.  We ordered the tofu soup. That was great. Others, just that taste. Not good not bad.
other Inside the Clarendon Hotel in central Phoenix, Gallo Blanco has quickly made a hit for themselves with hipsters and urban dwellers alike. They offer a refreshing alternative for hotel restaurants, with lively ambiance and great food and drink.Gallo Blanco's tacos are surefire hits. They're served individually, and come lined up in an appealing silver taco stand. We've ordered the carne asada and shrimp soft tacos, and, wow, they're really mouthwatering. The shrimp is flame grilled and seared, bringing out a nice full flavor. The guacamole is slightly sweet and chunky, and paired with outstanding tortilla chips, this is a must-order appetizer. Even the sauces (I prefer the red chipotle one) are addictive, either to accompany the supreme tacos, or to be enjoyed alone on chips.This restaurant is a fine addition to the emerging downtown Phoenix foodie scene, and with prices extremely reasonable, you get a lot. A good sized meal for two (sans drinks) could ring up at $30-35, which is a good value for great food. Try Gallo Blanco, bring friends, and get a bunch of items. Although I haven't explored the rest of the menu, I sense that Gallo Blanco's items don't stray far from excellence.
other So I've been back to Ra a few times now, and while the food is always acceptable, the service has gotten progressively worse each time. Today my co-worker and I actually waited an unbelievable 50 minutes for our food, which - if your waitress stops by, checks in with you, apologizes, lets you know she knows you've been waiting - wouldn't have been nearly so bad. Still extremely annoying, sure, but forgiveable. Not this waitress - we had to call her over for every thing we needed. Serioulsy, not once did she just stop by to check on us. We had to call her over to place our drink order, ask for sugar for our tea, to place our food order, to get the check, everything. So by the time the food came, I had to scarf down my grilled apple teriyaki salmon brick in other minutes to make it back to work on time. That's it, Ra - you've lost another customer.
other Didn't get to sit outside so a little disappointed.  We saw the "big assed burgers" and all decided to get one.  They were great but a bit messy.  Food and service were excellent.  Will try and get back for happy hour
3 My sweet tooth was yelling at me! I had to stop in. Four times (to date) and each time I try something different. Other than the cheese curds (which where just ok) each visit was for the frozen custard. VERY RICH and CREAMY a little goes a LOOOOONG way. I have tried a small berry sundae, a pineapple malt, and a small black cherry cheesecake concrete mixer. The sundae by far has been my favorite. I love the simplicity, the berries were not overly sweet, strangely artificially thickened. The malt was nice and malty which I really appreciated and was rather thick even after melting slightly. Now the concrete mixer was the richest of the rich. Maybe it was because I decided to go with a cheesecake flavor (to which you can add any other fruit or topping flavor). It was very tart like cream cheese (about as tart as a good Greek yogurt) with small bits of graham crumbs swirled through and of course the blackberry flavor.
other Finally another downtown lunch option.  I'm viewing this as the "in-between" place, in-between Arrogant Butcher's heavy on the lawyer, heavy on the political scene diners, and in-between "Celtic-Hooters", I mean, Tilted Kilt upstairs.  The food menu is interesting, a lot of appetizers.  Not enough salads for my taste. Compared to Arrogant Butcher and likely Tilted Kilt, the menu has less salads and less fried foods, but it'll be hard to find something healthy to eat.  It veers towards the comfort food side, with options like chili with cornbread souffle, and flatbreads served with burrata fondue.  There are a few flat bread options on the menu which is their version of pizza.  The day I went, the lunch room was busy. (You enter in through the a lobby shared with Stand Up Live).  Didn't get a chance to try out their amazing beer selection, will have to try that out the next time I'm here for a show.  The management and service is very friendly.  (Not in a scary way, just in a "I really want to enjoy your experience way).  This is in sharp contrast to the service at Lucky Strike across the way which I've found to be downright rude at times.  Keeping my fingers crossed that they continue to do well.
other We had the luxury of eating here over the past weekend and what a treat. I had the 8 oz. filet (with the blue cheese on top) and my wife had the 6 oz. Both excellent! Side dishes (starch/veggie) were solid! We ordered the house wine (recommended) and also cheaper by the glass than other featured items.Also, I am thrilled to see some of the newer restaurants coming to the area. Having lived in Carefree for almost 1other years...seeing it start to boom in addition to offering restaurants with flavor instead of simply Western decor really is nice.  Waiter was extremely informative. I even joked that he could of probably been a voice over in some animated movie or tv commercial. Anyhow, thanks for a great night out. We plan on coming back next time we visit...can't wait to try the seafood.
3 Where I live in Tempe, I can walk to the end of my street, hop on an Orbit which takes me to the main Bus Depot or can drop me off closer to the Light Rail stop off of Mill Ave. Not bad, right?I actually am enjoying the clustering of a real Bus Depot not anywhere near a residential area with plenty of security, lighting, public enough space in an easily accessible location in Tempe. I actually feel safe hanging out here at night and when I ride my bike to the station, all the bike racks face the security and transit office, so never had an issue with my bicycle here either.The buses themselves are fine, I have had some very bad moments on the bus with the passengers (ie the 1st time I got on a Phoenix bus, a knife-fight broke out and I had to stay for a police report, another time two guys were reading hard porn right across from  me), but its kinda nice mixing with people rather then being in a car-tomb.What I very much have an issue with is most bus stations. I have had bums passed out (dead?)  on the seat, meth heads, a single sign with no seating in the hot blazing sun (I am looking at you Scottsdale), seats no shade around, fights break out at stations. I try to call the metro, they say it isn't their issue. Call the police non-emergency number, they say its the Metro jurisdiction. For this very bad situation alone, I don't take the bus at night since all the stations near the arts area and central are not well lit, full of sketchy people and the buses take too long to come by (if they even stop). For this I am grateful for the light rail for late night Phoenix excursions. Metro still has a lot of work to do, but considering the improvements I have seen with public transportation and bicycle awareness in the past 3 years, it seems to be going on the right route.
other I usually try to stay away from the Arizona Mills mall. The mall itself has gotten crappier by the minute. Now, since I work close by, I was forced to go back to venture to Paradise Bakery. I honestly did not get my hopes up.Since it was lunch time, it was not busy at all. Nothing is worse that being on your work lunch, starving, and standing in line. I opted for the Chicken Walnut Sandwich, with a cup of Tomato Soup. The sandwich was delicious and fresh. The bread was perfect as was the chicken walnut salad. You know...sometimes chicken salad can get really gross..slimey..salty...yucky. This one was perfect and the walnuts added a delicious crunch.On to the soup. First off, I L-O-V-E tomato soup. It is my favorite. Would almost consider taking a bath in it. Hehehe...well, ok maybe not. BUT this soup rocked my socks off. Perfectly creamy, with a hint of smoky flavor, a small drizzle of sour cream and a few crunchy tortilla strips. YUM.So, venture there to try the soup but scurry fast and take the food with you. Don't eat there. Take it somewhere, where you can have a moment alone with the soup. Finito.
other Ok, so this business is currently run from a mobile kitchen.  Now I do mean that it is a kitchen.  The crepes are made to order, the ingredients are absolutely fresh and delicious.  They are currently going to various farmers markets, Old Town Scottsdale and Awatuke,  and going to private parties when they are asked.  So when you have the chance to find where they are and try them.  You won't be disappointed at all.  They are great.  Also check then out on twitter.
other I have a long history with this place, which is where I worked my first job at 16.  It's run by two Sicilian immigrants and there other sons.  Originally the owners had a joint in NY, but moved to the valley and opened this place.They run a military style kitchen where cleanliness is enforced to a maximum.  Almost everything is personally overseen by one of the two owners.They offer a regular Italian menu... the regular pasta choices, nothing too fancy and no Alfredo entree.They have some meat entrees with veal and chicken.The pizza is NY style and really good and rich.They offer a Garlic and Olive Oil pizza that is so good.  I get it with pepperonchinis on it.  The crust on the Sicilian pizza is the best I've had. Sometimes I just crave a small cheese pizza from this joint.The Eggplant Parmesan is in the house here, but everything holds it's own.It's priced ridiculously well, so much so, that the senior citizens roll out from Sun City all the time.They have a few beers on tap, all domestic, and some decent wine, but nothing fancy at all.The bottom line is that the food is good and cheap and the place is real.
3 In here for a sec but everyone seemed to be having a good time!  Live D.j. and enough room to be who u wanta be on the dance floor... there was poker going on in the corner and with a nice sized crowd. I liked the bartender chick, and she was fast for being the only bartender in there, and very nice.
other This is my second time @ J&G's. First time I hoenstly hated it. Second time WAYYY better!My bf & I stayed @ the Phoenician for a little stay-cation a few weekends ago. We decided to give J&G's another shot. We are both happy we did! When we came in our table was not ready so they sat us at the bar. We got other drinks and snacked on yummy popcorn and nuts - SO good! I wanted to bring it to the table lol - don't worry I totally didn't!We ordered a bottle of white wine and my bf ordered the Crispy Calamari ($12) to start. I was shocked when he said it was really tasty! He is so picky with his calamari, so already off to a good start! I ordered the Arugula and Boston Lettuce Mustard Vinaigrette salad ($10 i know I am such a cheap date) and he ordered the Pacific Halibut Summer Vegetable Vin Cilantro ($30). We also got a side of Roasted Mushrooms Herbs and Chilies ($9) and Steamed Broccoli ($9). Overall the meal was very good! All the flavors were amazing and so was the service. We will definitely return! :)
other This has by far been my favorite movie theater and favorite movie chain in Arizona.  This location is better than the others I have been to - quieter, friendlier staff.  The theaters are clean and usually not packed either.I love the t-shirt and cup program - and buying tickets at Costco.  I went to AMC last month, and spent a lot more money all the way around and did not like the theater either.
other I work on a local event called Ignite Phoenix, and somewhere in the mix we contacted Splinter Creative about helping us with the design and material for our event. We were completely new to this game and didn't really know what good branding and imagery could do for us. They stepped in, gave us some amazing ideas, helped us refine them, and delivered some incredible material that wowed everyone who attended.So we asked them to stick with us for our next event, and they did it again. They keep upping the game, and I now work with them across several different business that I work on.  They've helped me through several difficult creative areas, and the end result is always sharp, professional, interesting, and engaging.  I prefer to work with people who are passionate about what they do, and do it well.  Splinter fits that bill perfectly.  Highly recommended.
other Great food and service. Normally a wait on the weekend, but what would you expect.
other Had a bad day yesterday and decided my health-conscious lunch would *not* cut it as far as getting me through my work day. I've always loved VSC & have had their menu at my desk but I hadn't been in a while. Put an order together w/ some co workers & called. I was read to go pick it up, but then they told me THEY DELIVER! I don't believe they did the last time I'd been there. Went out on a limb & tried the Dead Head wrap - soooo good and WELL worth the price b/c it's huge. I almost took off a star b/c their pasta salad is NOT what it used to be. I don't know if they changed it or if they are just inconsistent in making it, but it was kind of embarrassing that I'd told my coworkers how awesome it was just to have it come out not so great.
other More expensive than some of the other nearby locations ($other military lot next door) The shuttle was nice and quick shuttle despite odd hours of the night. Nice enough, they also accepted competitor coupons when the lot with the deal was full. The boyfriend and I had a great experience and prompt service at all hours of the night. It also seems more secure. Loved it!
3 Ok, so I'm catching up on past-due reviews.  For me, Chipotle is one of those places you go to when you want something to eat from critters that have been decently treated while giving their life for your enjoyment.  And the food is ok too.  The guacamole is always fresh, the burrito's are big and there are lot's of add-ins.  Just don't expect any gustatory excitation, it's pretty basic, non-threatening, and I think I heard somebody refer to it as gabacho mexican food.  I think that pretty well sums it up.  However, a big plus is that the iced tea is always fresh and all-you-can-drink :-)
other So I came here in search for Phoenix's best Macaroni and Cheese. Yep, that's right, me and the inner kid in me are in search of the best Macaroni and Cheese. So, ordering was simple!So, how was it? Pretty good! It was more cheddary than, say, Beckett's Table (which got me started on this dance).The atmosphere was pretty cool there. However our wonderfully bubbly waitress probably came over way too much. Also, nobody coming over to refill our drinks (iced tea) could figure out that we had tea and not water. Oh well.On a separate note, I've gone by this place around 2AM it looks like a madhouse. Could be a rather interesting time around 2AM!
other Most amazing service! The food is common pho and buns but the main attraction is what drew me in it's not your typical Vietnamese restaurant it's a SPRING ROLL BAR!! Fantastic drinks! Great addition
other One of the few legit brewpubs around.
other We've got another first timer here...!I am just as shocked as the next person that after many years in Seattle, I had never had Bubble Tea.  Gasp!  You can get it almost as readily as Starbucks.  I learned it's also called Boba and maybe one other name.  It's all the same to me.  Same-same.I had my first boba initiation at the recent Office Hours with Gabi.  I was completely overwhelmed by the options presented to me: what type of chewies (for the record, that term just doesn't seem right), base drink, optional flavorings, etc.  It was a lot for this gal to handle.  Luckily, Alica B. was at my side leading me down the boba path.  She helped me pick out a concoction of Thai iced tea and regular boba.  Gotta start with the original boba, right?  She ended up with a coffee drink with coffee jellies.  I feel like I'm now "in the know" because she asked for the coffee jellies and even though they weren't on the menu, they indeed had them.  That's a little insider's tip from me to you.  Wink wink.  She was so excited I thought she was going to consider this woman the Patron Saint of Boba and commence worship on the spot.I was surprised to find how incredibly filling boba is.  I wasn't hungry for hours!  Overall, it was good.  I don't see myself craving boba, but if someone wants to go, then I'm in.  I'll check out the jellies in my next go round.  If the craving is boba, I would definitely recommend this place!
other Love me some hidden house! The music is too loud. The drinks too cheap. The clientele too local. But I've never had anything but a good time there. Whether it's karaoke or weird shit on the weekends you'll have fun if you don't expect it to be Merc, cuz Merc it ain't. And not for one moment in it's life has it pretended to be. But I love it for what it is and that's an experience.
other Don't know why it took me this long to check out Joe's Farm Grill but my out-of-towners got a kick of this place.We ordered :Fontina Burger - 4*BBQ Chicken Pizza - 4*Grilled Veggie Pizza - 3*Sweet Potato Fries - 2*Garlic Fries - 4*Onion Rings - 5*Chocolate Milk Shake - 2*The good:- great selection of American food / good portion sizes- allow upgrades to different kinds of fries to your meal- the decor & cute history behind the farm- open kitchen / sauce bar- friendly staff - outdoor picnic benches under a huge tree where the kiddies can enjoy themselves- hand washing fountain conveniently located by the soda fountain- kiddies love the cool restrooms The bad:  - lots of flies outside (that's summer in a farm for you)- limited seating inside- real vanilla milkshake tasted weird ( too much lemon juice?)
other Great fresh sandwiches!! The pastrami and caprese are absolute perfection!! The orzo pasta salad is spot on for the summer.  Definitely a must id in mesa..they need more central location for sure!
other I went here on a pub crawl after being turned away from an overcrowed Majerles during one of the Cardinal's game. I was surprised to find the place nearly empty when just down the road Majerles had people falling out the door, but after ordering a few round of drinks I soon found out why the place was empty. The bar tender and manager were annoyed by the size of our group. When most empty bars would probably embrace 2other people walking in the door wanting to order drinks, the Stoudemire's staff seemed overwhelmed and annoyed.  The restaurant is nice and clean, and the drinks were good yet overpriced.  I would defnitely not reccomend it for large groups.  For people looking for a good sports bar downtown head to Majerles because the patrons there seemed to be enjoying themselves and the staff seemed to enjoy having business.
other Very nice neighborhood spot.  The mussels are great and both pork dishes we tried were outstanding.  The Bacon-Cheddar biscuits make the meal and Fig pecan pie is the perfect finish.
3 Well, apparently Netflix just wasn't down with the whole "Extraordinarily Happy Customers" and "Providing Tremendous Value For The Money" business model that I raved about in my previous review.They're now changing their pricing structure so the One DVD At A Time "unlimited" package is $7.99 and the Watch Instantly unlimited package is also $7.99. So $15.98 together. They used to be $9.99 together. I'm keeping the "Watch Instantly" package for now, but the $7.99 for "One DVD At A Time" is just ridiculous. Yeah, they have a quick turnaround, but it's still the mail. You'd have to be a pretty hardcore movie watcher to get a better value out of an $8/month "unlimited" Netflix plan than just renting 8 $.99 movies at Blockbuster or Redbox. So yeah, I guess they're okay. The Watch Instantly service is still a decent deal. But "One DVD at a Time" is a total rip-off, and I never thought I'd use the word "rip-off" to describe Netflix.
other I was Frost bitten when the first location opened in Tucson. Since 2008, I have tried numerous gelato places and none have come close to the creaminess, tastiness and overall authentic fare as Frost. Each dip of the spoon is reminiscent of my travels abroad in Italy with memories that bring a smile to my face and pleasure to my tongue. The San Tan village location is 2other minutes away but the drive is worthwhile. The staff is friendly, helpful and armed with spoons for you to sample any flavor you wish. I went with the dark chocolate and salted caramel. Truly delightful! Word on the street is there are 3 locations to pop up around the Phoenix area. I think Tempe would be a great choice! Hint hint....
other Aside from the Macy's on 34th street in NY, this one is my favorite store.  They carry all my favorite designers, especially for work clothes.  Not to mention, the shoe department always the hottest selection of pumps.  There's a tiny Ukrainian woman that works in the shoe department, I love her, she is SO patient with me and gives me her two cents as she keeps bringing out the shoes.  I wanna meet the buyer for this store and become her/his bestie.  They also have a personal shopper near the women's dressing rooms.  Not that I'd ever have the need for one but you might.  The sales people are always really nice and helpful.On a side note: I once met this old guy who said he brought Janis Joplin to this store to buy panties when she did a show here.  I've always doubted that story but it never fails that when I go to the lingerie department I tell myself "I'm standing where the late great Janis stood."  She's one of my all times.
3 Really solid lunch deals and pretty close to Tex-Mex which I still get cravings for from time to time. I had the spinach chicken enchiladas and they were nice. It was a ton of food (of course) so we definitely needed boxes for leftovers. If you're in the neighborhood, it's a solid deal and I'd stop in again. My only wish is that they did a green sauce with the spinach chicken enchiladas. That would be heaven.
other So I am not usually in the Tempe area, but a friend told me about this place. So I though I would go try it out. I got a Grande Latte that was around $4. Not a bad price. But what made it worth it was that I guess this Friday I went was a Free Shot Friday. So I got an extra Espresso shot in my latte making it a triple for $other bucks...no that is a deal. Not sure if they always have the promotion on Fridays. But it sure did make my morning a little better.Their menu is very easy to read and give those no too educated in the was of coffee a good description of what each drink is and how it is made.The had a ton of great looking pastries even though I didn't sample any. Cakes, Eclairs, Scones, and I think even what looked like cheesecake. The decor was very interesting. An old fashion coffee house meets a gypsy vibe. I think they have Wifi too. I saw a few people on there computers.The service was a little slow I think. Felt like I was waiting for my drink for 10 minutes and the place was not really that busy. This was probably because of the guy ahead of me when I walked in who had about 7 different modifications to his drink. I have worked in a coffee place and those people are kind of annoying. So I will let them slide on the time of service.Overall a great experience. Would have been 3 stars, but when you get something for free, in my book that is an automatically another star.
other This Dutch Bros had some of the best customer service I've ever seen from a young guy working on a holiday (Memorial Day). I ordered an Americano which was excellent and just the right proportions. My wife had a soy chai latte which was just a little too sweet, but still good.Overall, it was an experience I would recommend, and it's staying on our list of go-to places as we explore our new neighborhood.
other Exactly what a hole in the wall Pho place should be like! Totally reminds me of LA, SF or any authentic Pho place in any multi-cultural city. Congrats Phoenix for not being completely white bred and redneck- must give thanks to center city.Anyhow, portions are large, ingredients taste fresh and prices are inexpensive. If you're one of the sheltered folk out here that gets freaked out by rude bums or the lack of decor- stay in the shelter of your HOA tract home or go to the mall.
other Went here for lunch a couple weeks back and told myself I would write a review...i completely forgot! :( But today I drove by it and it reminded me to write a review. First thing is...Value.....You get a ton of food....for basically nothing....they have daily specials that are always good but their burritos that can stuff a horse are like 3$....Be warned however that they dont tell you this....so when you order a burrito and 3 tacos because you think it cant be much food due to the low price......you'll know. I got a burrito with pork and it was delicious...too many beans for me but thats easily correctable next time....by time I got half way...I knew there was no way I was getting to taste the "famous fish tacos" if I kept going. So I stopped with the burrito and moved on to the fish tacos....yum...they were very good....I still prefer the burritos..but as a lighter meal you can do the tacos and be very full and very happy. Again...beans were a bit much but Ill just ask for light beans next time. They also make these flavored lemonade slushis there that are pretty tasty. All in all a very friendly place with friendly owners who live up to the name of the place and they make great food for VERY affordable prices. When I was there they were Cash Only...I dont know if that has changed...but bring cash just in case.
other I'm glad that Cafe Rio Mexican Grill opened up in Town and Country.  We have been to Cafe Rio a couple of times now.  On Tuesday they have tacos for $1.50.  Cafe Rio is now my favorite place for tacos.  The beef and pork tacos are the best.  If you are looking for a good taco you should check out Cafe Rio.
other Lunch review:  Great quick lunch options. I'm a big fan of the lunch salads.  They are very filling (paired with the free chips and salsa!!)  My favorite is the Chipotle Chicken Salad (Mixed lettuce, black beans, roasted corn, cheese mix, pico de gallo topped with grilled chicken)-- it's only $6.99.  The spunky chipotle dressing is delish.  There are also several lunch-sized versions of dinner plates available for diners looking for a heartier meal.  The service is always friendly and were are able to get in and out in less than an hour, which is very convenient during a busy work day.
3 I give this place 3 stars because of how friendly the lady that worked there was and how amazing their prices were. It was pretty unorganized though and I am sure that it is due to people moving books to where they shouldn't be and there just being too many books to keep organized. It is not a bad book store at all, just be prepared to have to dig and dig for what you are looking for. Worth it though for the prices :)
other Just did take out.  Great experience.  Easy to place my order over the phone, friendly service.  Nice that they have special pick up parking spots and entrance.  Made it an in and out operation.  Ordered the gluten free pizza with pepperoni and sausage.  My husband and son loved it and have already been asking to get it again.  I had the spaghetti calzone and was in HEAVEN.  I highly recommend it.
other So glad to have found great Thai in my neighborhood.  We thought when we moved away from Tempe that we had lost our access to great ethnic food.  Luckily we found this little gem.  Great ambience, friendly quick service, and fantastic food.  We ordered the green curry chicken and the drunken noodles with vegetables.  Great sized portions for reasonable price.  We got ours on a 3 out of other scale of heat and it was perfect for us.  I have a feeling we'll become regulars.
3 This is your run-of-the-mill sports bar that caters to the not-so-blue-collar 30something crowd of Chandler.  The ambiance is nice, darker, big screen TVs everywhere... the waitresses are attractive (a staple at these types of places) and they are friendly and attentive... ours was on this very day.  It's Beer Week in AZ this week and they had just hosted a SanTan event (pub crawl) today as part of Beer Week, so they were understandably out of SanTan Devil's Ale and the place was quite quiet when we arrived at 5pm. We got seated at the patio where the have a nice little Bocce ball area and it was nice to enjoy the great Phx February weather.Alright, so we ordered burgers as we were both in the mood for a sizable piece of beef, hopefully topped with bacon and other yummies.  They did a pretty good job for being a sports bar, but not impressive. They claim their meat is fresh ground, though when that's the case, the patty has a different type of form and is less flat and compacted.. okay, maybe they grind it in the AM and then stockpile patties for the day.. that's fine.  The bacon (I ordered the #9 All Star - cheddar, bacon, beef) was lame... thin, a bit stale-tasting, and not crispy.  The cheese was fine.  I did like that the meat was char-broiled and so it has a good taste to it.  Also, the inside wasn't over cooked and the bread they served it on was kinda sweet and giant... tasty, actually.The sides were blaaaah.. cole slaw was really boring and had literally 3 ingredients (white cabbage, carrots, sugary mayo) something I would expect from Chili's or Denny's.Well, the burger hit the spot but the rest was plain and boring.  The Stella was not as cold as I prefer.  Our staff was very good.  So far, an OK place to visit, but a other star place is somewhere I will likely go out of my way to visit.. this didn't make the cut.
3 Had lunch at the Burger Studio yesterday. I always get nervous when there are not too many people in the restaurant at lunch or dinner. Usually a sign of some sorts. Ordered the Studio Burger and I thought onion rings (felt like I was down a quart of oil). What seemed like a long time to receive my food, I was unhappy to see fries instead of onion rings. Oh well. The hamburger extended over the bun which is always a good sign for a custom product. I was impressed with the bun as well, not a flat, stumpy bun but a high top with a nice sheen. It was delicious and the fries were good as well. Owner stopped in we greeted at which point I told him about the fries/onion rings and he immediatly comped me an order. They came out and looked very oily. Distictive beer batter flavor. Not that good....stick with the fries which are great. Overall....great tasting burger and fries and compared to the other guys (Zin, The Grind, Smash Burger) I put it right up there and a lot less expensive.
other It'd be nice to see this chain grow and get a little more traction in the Valley.  The shoestring fries are pretty good, the burgers have a great seasoning.  Maybe the burgers could be a little bigger, I guess, but I'm nitpicking.The real star for me is the custard, and my favorite is picking up a good chocolate shake.  The stuff is very rich and a sugar coma waiting to happen.  Shakes aren't the cheapest, but they're pretty unbeatable mood boosters.I'll have to change my review once I try more on the menu, but for now, I'm a fan, and I enjoy the place.  Good fast food and doesn't disappoint.
other First off, let me say that I live almost across the street from here and have been waiting for a grocery store downtown for almost other years.  I was there the very first day they were open and have been back three or four times since.  I waited to write my review until they had their "grand opening" and until they had gotten into the groove of having a market.Boy, where do I start with the complaints?  The biggest complaint is not so much the hours but the DAYS that they are open.  Maybe I'm weird but I do my grocery shopping on Sunday.  We specifically didn't get a few things from F&E because we wanted the ones from the market.  I try and go Sunday but they are closed.  Try and go back Monday...they are closed.  At this point, I really need those items and I'm just going to buy them from a normal store.  It doesn't make any sense why you would have a ton of vendors there on Saturday dropping off their goods only to have them sit, locked up, until Tuesday.  If you need two days off, take Saturday and Wednesday off when the outdoor market is in full swing.My next complaint is the selection.  I'm not even going to complain that you don't have basic things like fruit or butter.  I'm going to complain that you carry fish from Alaska (not local) and that you carry Shamrock milk! WTF! You could be carrying SuperFarm milk, butter, and ice cream but instead you carry the same thing Target has.  Try supporting real local business instead of mega-giant Shamrock Farms.Finally, what's with the "wine bar"?  Is it actually somewhere in the building or am I supposed to sit in the middle of the produce and drink?  It really feels like too much room was wasted on the sandwich/wine bar counter area and not enough was set aside for actual groceries.  I know this place will get better but right now one would be pretty hard pressed to do their grocery shopping here.
other Had the enchiladas - cheese and shredded beef - and some mini chimichangas which were both good. Salsa is fresh and tasty. Friendly service. Will be back next time I'm in Florence!
other My husband and I enjoyed a "staycation" here for my birthday. We had an amazing time! We took advantage of the great happy hour specials at the poolside bar and at the Sangria bar. The Sangria bar had billiards and a card table. They also had a wonderful Happy Hour menu where everything is $5. Excellent hamburgers and margaritas. We enjoyed a beautiful  dinner at Palm Court and a breakfast buffet at Vista Verde. We took advantage of the free bike rentals and the exercise facility. The staff was amazing and very accommodating. They have definitely earned our business and will refer our friends.
other I love Greek food. I have no idea when I became so enamored with Greek cuisine but I am glad I did. I end up craving it at least once or twice a week so when I met the fiance for lunch today near his office I mentioned aforementioned craving and he led us here to Cyprus Grill.The place was pleasantly busy but not overcrowded. We ordered at the counter and out food came out pretty quickly. We tried the gyro pita as well as the gyro plate. We cleared our plates in no time so I guess that means the food was good, right? The gyro meat was tasty, moist and flavorful. The rice was delicious and the tzatziki sauce was refreshing. We decided that we'd be going back for future lunch dates whenever possible. Besides, you can't have too many go to Greek spots in my opinion so this one's definitely going in our books. Done and Done.
other The meat and bread is so fresh that it makes Mr. Goodcents my number one sub place to hit up when in the mood for a sub
other Probably not the best pizza I've ever had, but definitely in the top 5!  Had the groupon deal of 50% off, so that made it even a better experience.  Not exactly the atmosphere for a "date night", but the quality of bread/sauce/toppings is fantastic.  If you like specialty beer and pizza, there is no reason not to try this place.  Will be returning for sure!
other Tim is really a very friendly and honest guy. He will tell you what you need or what can wait. This place is worth going to! It will save you tons of money!
other I believe this place is over-hyped.  the menu is overpriced.  the portions are small.  the meat is low quality.  slow service.  sterile decor.

other Great place for lunch, transport yourself back in time to this quaint farm grill which offers high quality food, fresh ingredients, killer burgers and an atmosphere that is one of a kind.  Good place for breakfast as well.  Family owned restaurant goodness.  Only drawback is the line, however good things come to those who wait.
3 I came in here to order to get takeout it was 19.99 For other cheese pizza's ummm not so cheap. They only use other type of cheese the pizza was not great I wouldnt go that route again but I am willing to go back and try the Veggie pizza. I surprised my brother with some suicide wing's I dont eat meat but I did try the sauce and ate some w my pizza it was HOT. He loved them all 20 were gone at the end of the night. They said they were SO HOT but the boys just couldnt stop eating them. They said they were very good meaty and not too vinegary. An extra star for making the boys happy with the hella hot wings that night. FYI they probably use hydrogenated oils here by the way but I didnt ask!
other I went back tonite for more LFC. This time, the chicken pieces seems to be a little bit bigger than last time. The menu now has a disclaimer saying that some sides may incur an additional charge.  That was two of my gripes on my first visit, so check and check.. This time, I ordered an 8pc with other large sides...As stated above, chicken was bigger, and it was hot and moist..perfectly seasoned. For sides, I ordered the sweet corn nuggets and mac and cheese. They had run out of mac and cheese and had to make more. It took about 10 minutes to make. Was it worth the wait? It was fresh, REAL macaroni and cheese, baked in the oven, not some "out of the box" variety. It was made with real cheese, as witnessed by the stringy cheese when eaten. My comment here is that I prefer a more creamy variety than what it was. But it definitely was better than Kraft mac & cheese in a box. The sweet corn nuggets were incredible. Not sure if they are something they make fresh or if it comes out of a freezer bag, but they were delicious little morsels. Nuggets of corn kernals, surrounded by a light crunchy coating and deep fried. I wanted to try out their fried shrimp, so I got an "add on" of other fried shrimp ($1.99). At first view, I was disappointed. What I got were other very small (think MAYBE 45-50 sized shrimp). They were not even butterflied, which would have made them appear bigger). But upon tasting them, I really enjoyed the flavor. They appeared to be freshly breaded (is it the same seasoned flour used for the chicken?) and were very tasty. My suggestion here would be to 1) butterfly the shrimp and 2) get a slightly larger shrimp (even if it means a price increase). With my second trip to LFC, I am becoming an even bigger fan..Tasty chicken, good sides, a clean restaurant, and nice employees.
other I'm a big fan of their strawberry water and if I'm looking for a better lunch than what I have at home I'll swing by and pick up a salad from here.  They have a good selection- and it's constantly expanding.
other Best basic $1other in/exterior wash i got in a while. Didnt even have to tell them to wipe down anything.
other I am a Regus member and could get wait here since I could use my membership card.Its a great place situated on 3rd floor with awesome city view. Complimentary menu is refreshing. Cordial staff. Quiet and relaxed environment.Many TV screens and seatings to get comfortable with.
3 Approaching the front of the building, I was instantly impressed with the theatrical lighting on the outside of the building, the foyer is large, ruby red and created a grand mood when I walked in. They even had large crystal chandeliers.  The theater itself is a nice size, not large, but sits on the medium scale. My seat for the Christmas production of the Nutcracker was on the third row, center and the view was nice. There didn't seem to be any room for live band or orchestra, but the sound system was full.
other I must have looked like a poor, ugly person the other day bc seriously NO ONE helped me. no one even said hi. I was in there for an hour too. I decided not to buy anything bc the service was so bad. this is a little bit like OJ's "i didnt kill my wife, but if I did this is how I would do it" in that if someone had helped me I would have bought 6 place settings- mats, chargers, napkins and napkin rings. I also would have bought several drapery panels. but no way was I going to spend that much money at a place that couldn't even say hello or ask a girl carrying around a ton of place settings if she needed help. so i just set everything I had gathered up over the hour in a pile and left. you're welcome employees, hope you had fun putting everything away. i also hope they work on commission and are regretting not saying hi to me.
other So, I say to myself, "half price sushi for lunch? Oh yeah! You betcha!" well, even at half price, it's tough for me to get excited about thus place. There's no real creativity (except for the disco balls during "happy birthday", seriously, uh yes) and it's fairly generic fare. The other stars are really for the fact the service was Johnny on the spot for edamame, miso and salad. The main fare though, just plain lacking. You're better off heading a mile or other down Ray over to Ra.
other The burger I had there was tasteless and had a weird texture. The fries were decent and their signature Rootbeer was delicious, but I've definitely had better elsewhere.In all fairness, I did not try their frozen selection, so I will definitely come back to give them another try.
other I'm going to keep this one general and not too detailed; we all have to keep something private from the rest of the Yelp world, right?!I will say that last night after the Ignite event and post Ignite event, Jared and I stopped by this Fascinations store... we were pleasantly greeted by the staff but since we were not looking for anything specific, they let us wander and be 'fascinated' by all of the sex toys, party favors, under garments, games, videos, and more... (they do have a decent selection!)Not that I go into these types of stores often, but when I do, I like having the comfort of being with someone I am close to and/or not being harassed by the salespeople. (Yes, I'm shy, what can i say?!)  Luckily, I had both of these things during my visit last night.  We did make a few purchases, and I even tried to sneak in a package of 'nippies' since J was paying.  He caught it though, and decided to take those off of the bill (they were $14).  I thought they would be perfect for getting a nice tan line - I may have to return to make that purchase on my own!If you're in the market for anything that you think Fascinations may carry (and believe me, if you think they do, they probably do), go pay them a visit!  Enjoy and remember to practice safe sex!
other Upon first glance this is appears to be a very usual strip mall type bar but behind the black glass lies a more unusual bar and grill.We went on a Sunday for the Jets-Ravens game and it was a fun time.. This is one of those places you likely have passed a hundred times on the way to work or going to Scottsdale using Indian School Rd. It is set back into the strip mall so you would not see it from the street. Why Teakwoods is special comes from its extremely quality food which you would not expect from a place that lets you throw peanut shells on the floor. Like most bars it has a bevy of TV's and a rowdy but pleasant crowd. The food was really good though I would never call this "fine dining". An extremely great place to go when you want to be stuffed with semi-greasy food..I had their famous wings and I can honestly say they were outrageous. I especially liked the cheese balls which are hard to find as WineBurger stopped carrying them.No particular reason this place wasn't other stars..it just didnt have that other star feel..maybe in the future when I go back.
other Looove this place!  I loved the sexy, yet simple atmosphere.  I felt as though the air was cleaner somehow just walking inside.Let me first say that Happy Hour prices were outstanding!  I have to admit, I think my favorite Happy Hour spot, StingRay, has just been outdone!The food was delicious!  All of it!  ALL...OF...IT!  From the cucumber salad to their famous appetizer, the mustard leaf wrap, it is flavorful and fresh.The service was pretty good, but there was some confusion I think more than once, so it delayed the service a bit.  When I have to stop and say, "Hey, where's my [fill in the blank], I know the service is lacking, although I would say not enough to keep me away!I was really, really happy when I left here, might have been my company, but we all loved it so that is what mattered!
other Ok, Ok, I know I said I would never bring my clothes here, ever again.I was having a rather busy week, so I told my Dad to drop my clothes off to the cleaners. I thought he was going to take my stuff over to Continental where I usually go, but he brought everything to Seville. I was a little upset, but being the angel of a son that I am, I bit the bullet and smiled. I thanked him for helping me out. When it came time to pick up my clothes, I carefully walked in (knowing I slammed them in my past review) and quietly picked up my clothes.I got home, and noticed that one of my shirts had not been cleaned properly. There was a stain on it from what I think was cola. Later that day, I drove back to Seville, and they offered to clean it once more.Flash forward to the next pickup day, the stain was still there. I asked for a manager, and it happened to be someone that seemed to be the owner. He asked how much I paid for the shirt. They gave me a check for the FULL amount. It's very rare that I write a review update that spans a few stars (only DeFalco's comes to mind), but Seville took my crappy situation, and made it right. I was VERY hesitant in coming back the first time around, and it was only because I was forced to. I'm glad everything worked out the way it did. Not because I got a new shirt out of it, but because I got a better experience.Way to step up your game Seville. I'll be back if I'm in the area!
other I Love Lolo's Chicken and Waffles and you will too! Recently my fiancé and I went to Lolo's. I had heard about Lolo's and Mrs. White's for years, but never took the time to go to the Phoenix locations. When this south Scottsdale location opened, I made it a point to go and try the food. The food is excellent or in my best Brooklyn accent "Forget about it". But don't forget about it, the MAC-N-CHEESE is a most try. The chicken is FANTABULOUS, the COLLARD GREENS are on point and they serve Kool Aid. Yes I said Kool Aid. I must have had a gallon of GRAPE KOOL AID. Before this, the last time I had Kool Aid was 1968. This place is very popular, so you may have to wait for a table, but it is well worth it. This place is so popular that Sports, Music, Acting and Reality celebrities can be seen here regularly. When we were there we saw the rapper Biz Markie. He did the song "Just a Friend" back in 1990.  The only down side - although the service was generally good, it gets so busy that at times the server may get distracted and may not come back to you as timely or often as you may like. BOTTOM LINE, I LEFT FULL, HAPPY AND WITH A KOOL AID SMILE. TRY IT YOU WILL LIKE IT
other Can't remember the last time I was at a Hard Rock Cafe. This visit was only memorable for 1) Amanda Peachey's gorgeous face and voice 2) the jungle like humidity inside the place.Our servers were attentive. Our drinks were frequently refilled. But it's just not as "hard rock" when it's so family friendly. It's a very small space, and being in downtown Phoenix on a Saturday night in summer, it was sparsely populated as well. Maybe I'm missing the point, but overpriced drinks and signed guitars on the walls do not bang my shutters.
3 I'd recommend this place highly for two situations:  1.) You are on the west side of town and you want some reasonably priced grub, 2.) You've never had Vietnamese food and you want to try it out in a non-intimidating environment.  For those two things, PA is awesome!   Nice people, decent food, and a very friendly environment. But their food doesn't stack up to the central Phoenix standard bearers.I suppose that their score is artificially low because of the category they are competing in.  Were they the only game in town, I suspect I would have rated them much higher - just to get my hands on a Bahn Mi every now and again.
other The new, old El Chorro Lodge has been reopened for all of two days, and a friend of a friend managed to secure a reservation during their soft opening, so I got an opportunity to check it out.  I was impressed, but not blown away.  Everything I tasted was quite competent, but if I had to choose a word to describe the menu, I would suggest "staid."  Perhaps even "stodgy," but that may be more harsh than I intend.Review the dinner menu.  http://bit.ly/aWqVVJ.  There, see what I mean?  Replete with Traditional American entrees and sides, at what I would consider fairly exorbitant prices.  I would say that I wouldn't go back to eat this food at these prices, unless someone else was paying.  I should note that a big part of why I wasn't impressed is because this place is simply not my style.  The wait staff, attired in khakis and blue shirts, was a little too informal for the prices we were paying, I felt.  The menu options were a little boring for my taste.  The cocktail menu is exactly not what I'm looking for these days, although I will be very interested to see what Happy Hour looks like.  The decor is a tad heavy on the Old Southwest theme, although to be fair, this place not only pulls it off rather stylishly but also is among the most authentically old and southwestern establishments in the Phoenix metro area.  The patio and open bar are fantastic.  The bar area is considerable, and the patio is palatial - up above Lincoln Dr enough to be fairly quiet, with a gorgeous view of Camelback, sunset here must be incredible.  Anyway, back to the food.  Everything was very well executed, from the sticky buns we were served upon being seated to the desserts we ordered.  I chose the soup of the day to start, a tomato/basil concoction that was quite hearty and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The salads my dining companions ate looked boring to me, but they all claimed them to be excellent, with "the best Caesar dressing ever" and "polenta croutons?!?" being the verdict for the Caesar salad, at least.  On to the entrees.  I ordered the crispy duck, which I found to be delicious and quite hearty, though not what I would call crispy by any means.  It was a very sizable portion, and very well prepared.  My dining companions ordered the pork chop, the lamb, and the salmon, and we each sampled from each other's plates.  I would try the lamb if I went back, but the consensus seemed to be that everything was very well prepared, with the duck being a winner.  It was served with a heap of mushy sweet potatoes (just like my mom makes at Thanksgiving - delicious!) and red cabbage, which I sampled and declined to finish.  Again, not quite my style.  We moved on to dessert - sticky bread pudding with a bourbon glaze and the warm chocolate cake.  The bread pudding was a winner at the first two or three bites, but grew one-dimensional as I continued nibbling at it.  The chocolate cake was decadent, among the best I've ever tasted.  It was clearly made with a considerable amount of dark chocolate, which seals the deal for me.  And in case you were wondering, my dining companions apparently have no stamina when it comes to dessert.  Suckers.  Anyway, as I've said now several times, this place is just not quite me.  It's totally classy and very high in quality, but not quite adventurous enough for my taste.  I'd love to come back for brunch, and once they unveil their happy hour menu, I'm sure I'll be back to check it out, but I won't be back for dinner unless I can convince someone else to pick up the check at the end of the evening.  As a side note, this place is so very Paradise Valley.  It's a welcome relief knowing that there is a place that is so anti-scene out there.  It's been a little while since I've been both the youngest and among the poorest in a room, and I will say it was a little comforting.  Just don't tell the Scottsdale people about this place, and we'll all be happy.
other Phenom. The food is always fresh and well seasoned. A good selection of Tequila. Every meal that I've had has been just fantastic. The carnitas and the fish taco's are very well prepared. It's fresh, the beans are fresh as is the rice. It averages about $10 a plate but worth it. This is how really good Mexican should be. The salsa bar is excellent: you have about other different types of salsa from which to choose. All freshly made. I can't say enough about the flavoring of the meats and fish. Decor is a somewhat minimalist/modern, probably to attract a happy hour crowd. They have TV's for your viewing pleasure. Service is friendly and quick. I've only been to the Chandler location but will start going to the one in Scottsdale. Good food. You won't be disappointed.
other This was our third visit and I have to say the service is impeccable. They are attentive, friendly and helpful. I can't remember what we had our first visit, it was right after they opened and during the awkward stage. The second visit we had pizza it was good, we were looking for deep dish which they don't make but it was good and great service. Tonight we all had different things: Mostaccioli for my older son he was very happy, cheesy and flavorful sauce. Spaghetti and meatball off the kid's menu for the younger boy, sweet sauce and a big meatball another happy boy. Husband had the Chicago Grinder hot and it was gone in a flash and he said it was really good. It looked great on the toasted bread. He also got a salad instead of fries, lots of fresh veggies. I had the Italian Beef with peppers and onions, it comes with Giardiniera and au jus and french fries. The bread was yummy soft yet substantial enough to withstand au jus. The bread was stuffed, stuffed with meat, the peppers and onions were good but the giadiniera made it. It was a really good sandwich. San Tan Brewery on tap - yum.I could give them other stars but I've had better Italian Beef though I will admit I'm not an expert. A great dinner and I hope to return soon.
other My vintage shopping in the Phoenix area has been disappointing so far. Goodwill, Salvation Army, and Savers are in their separate boat of cheap stuff that is rarely vintage.  Buffalo Exchange shouldn't even be called vintage, because it is not. It is much more of a consignment store. Most of the things are new (or lightly worn) and are cheaper than retail prices but more expensive than Goodwill. The selection really isn't bad. I have found a few things here I am really happy with. Example: A sweet pair of orange high heels from Steve Madden I think. (I don't really give a crap about brand names, I buy things because I like em, no matter the name). They were thirty bones (not too cheap) but probably a lot less than they would have been at the mall (I am guessing, 60?).Its still a fun store despite the vintage confusion. Everyone who works there I think gets all the good clothes first because they are always so freakin' adorable! Super friendly (not the fake kind either, can you believe someone is f*cking the handshake in this metropolis?). So get over there. You will find some good stuff. Just don't even bother selling anything unless it is high end brand name or the best vintage find you have ever gotten (and that one is even not a guarantee).
3 The sales people here are very knowledgable and helpful. They are also very friendly and great with reccomendations.I know it is a comic store but I only went there for DnD books/suppliments and ocassional Anime.I am pretty sure their Anime is bootleged, but due to how cheap it is and the fact that you usually can't find it anywhere else I don't care. They often come in complete sets for like 30 bucks which is great for a whole series. I have had problems watching them on PS2/Xbox sometimes but due to the price I keep coming back. Now then if it weren't for this next part they would have a other star.They no longer sell DnD books, or Dice sets which breaks my heart. They always had the best selection when it came to dice and I haven't been able to find another place that carries more than 5-6 at a time.Out of all the Atomic Comics I have been to I like this one the most, the people there are always fun and inviting I can't stress that enough.
other Let me start by saying after my experience I surly wish they had half or quarter stars and I am not often found with a lack of words but this is going to take some effort to stomach.Strolled into this establishment at about 1:30 am, now to their credit I fully understand the crowd on mill at these hours so I lower my levels of expectations..Place is moderately busy as we walk in, I get to the counter, order some pepperoni pizza and a pretzel with other drink cups. Second drink cup is forgot after they ran out of the dispenser, after I remind him he gets a fresh stock of cups to replenish his dispenser but first takes his hand, fingers placed inside the cup and hand me one. Yuck.. Gf didn't catch it so I gave her the first cup and took the lingering finger taste cup as my own.Fast forward a few minutes, guy is in there , his friends are loud and his face is cut wide open from who knows what incident.. He is arguing and finally his friends get him out the door. Now if I ran this place that guy and his yelling and problems would have been asked to stay, his hands Nd bloody shirt bumping and squeezing past people was discussing . But.. Let's let that go because it's busy and again this is MIll and it is other am..Fast forward 10 minutes.. Tell the guy the ice machine is out, several minutes later.. They fill it.. Again it's busy, no big deal on that one, and with the high temp in the place maybe it killed on the fingerprint bacteria in my cup while we waited.. "I'm a wishful thinker"Several more minutes go buy of people bustling past, smearing nastily cheese wish sandwich wrappers all o over the floor as We walked by "place was trashed" I go back up and ask the guy for our order.. He said", oh sorry forgot" I was amused but it's just sliced pizza and a pretzel.. He tosses them in the oven, and a couple minutes later I get them. Well pizza had obviously been there forever but it was pizza, pretzel was hard as a rock and couldn't eat it.Then the show starts.. there had been a few people in there, that obviously knew the gentlemen working the register, the flooding actions are the cause for this reviewing of the above..Short list-employee is wiping his sweaty face by hand, receiving money..then is prepping pizza with topping BY BARE HAND.. Placing it in the oven, all with out gloves. This occurs over and over, then when his friends arrive there is a round of hand slaps... Um.. Where did these guys come from, did they wash their hands?, eww.  So in the 4other minutes I am in here,no hand washing, no gloves..his hands on food, toppings, money, hands, face, along with all over surfaces possible. Freaking DISGUSTING.But it gets better.. His friends that he is conversing with are about to ice the cake..  One of them this red headed guy is reaching behind the counter near the pick up, and grabbing fries out of the Bin with his hands.. This happens no less than 10 times..Another one ask his to meet them in the bathroom... Um what? Yes.. That locked bathroom father other am that is closed off to customers.. Hmm my imagination can only wonder what brief activity occurred in the restroom. could my dazed and non health conscious server and front man for this business also be doing drug's one can only speculate. His actions after reflected a very relaxed and dazed person.Where I will give this guy a couple points, is end of the night he started picking up the place as it had slowed, well this obviously is his job and they have to clean up at the end of the night anyways..but was surprised at this point. At this point and my food not eaten we are done being entertained by watching all this and he asked to take our plate at which time he noticed I didn't eat much. He asked if the pretzel was not good and I choose this time to politely tell him the reasons above as why we didn't finish. He took it in stride, with no attitude but said simply they got busy and backed up. I do appreciate that but honestly there is ZERO excuse for even a small percentage of the actions to have taken place. I see this as a health risk and was more comfortable at taco stands in Mexico than this establishment. In short, I'll be contacting the owner of this location. I do realize this is a late night food offering, I do realize the clientele, but I also know this is unacceptable and some poor guy who is mismanaging this place needs a wake up call.I will be back very soon, if anything just to see if changes are made after I voice my concerns. If needed ill be happy to forward my videos to the county health inspector.-Thanks for reading this little novel.
3 I haven't been to a Sweet Tomatoes location in well over 3 years. I have never been to this location before, but the service was good. The selections haven't changed that much. I was pleased to see they had strawberry muffins with strawberry butter. YUMMY! The salads are still fresh and good.I wish they had more non dairy alternatives there.
other RIP AZ Coffee Connection.  :(  I stopped by two days ago unaware that they had closed.  I am severely bummed.  This place is irreplaceable!  Damn you, Starbucks and McDonalds!
other Tempe Beach Park - such a gem in our landlocked State...Sure, it's a man-made water source, and yes - it's pretty nasty if you plan on swimming inside Tempe Town Lake, but it's gorgeous during the day and at night too!I've done a handful of triathlons that started and ended at Tempe Beach Park, and most recently, I did the PetSmart Walk (go team Yelp) that took place at the park as well... With the proximity of the park to ASU / Mill Ave, it really is a fun place to go hang for an afternoon - no matter what's going on there...My only words of wisdom - don't swallow the lake water!
other Good place to go if you're hungry and don't want to cook breakfast.  Not great due to the fact that most of their food is straight from the freezer to the frying pan and just so-so.  Small portions of bland food.  Great people and great service.  Just altogether blah food.
3 Probably more worthy of 3.other stars.  Damn the Yelp constraints!  Marketplace was pretty busy tonight now that you can actually go out in the evening without a gentle breeze feeling more like a blow torch in your face.  In spite of that, our wait to be seated was fairly quick.  But where was our server?  Outside listening to the band?  We need liquid refreshment!Finally our server arrived and apologized for the wait at the same time the manager arrived and also apologized and comped us an appetizer.  Wow!  We hadn't even complained.  We had the hummus which was very tasty but a little thin and a mango tandoori chicken pizza.  Nice combination of sweet mango, spicy curry sauce, and the grilled chicken.  Service was excellent once we got over the initial bump.While I usually don't plan to go to CPK, it's nice to know this one is there.
other I am ready to update you to a five because the last three times I have been there, your service has been better, the huevos rancheros has been consistently perfect, I have never had to wait for a seat at the bar and I want to hug the cute new bartender because she is quirkily cute!! If you were still serving breakfast at 6pm, I would come eat you now.
other Chef Bianco does it again! The homemade pasta is unreal. You can actually taste the freshness of all of the ingredients. The pasta is thick (like homemade pasta is supposed to be...) but not heavy at all. I also loved the casual vibe and the staff was very friendly and nice. You really feel like a guest sitting in the kitchen in a home somewhere in Italy.
other A great restaurant staff! They go above and beyond for their customer.Try the buffet you will not be disappointed.Bacon is cooked to perfection. Fruit is fresh and the seating is perfect for large groups.
other Heaven. Fuego is just heaven. This super small, yet charming place is our favorite!! The menu is unique, and delish!! The creamed corn is to die for, I am talking unbelievable!! Thirsty? Their mojito selection is insane and they have an even better happy hour. Only negative is, that because of its small size, it fills up fast. reservations are a must!
3 Threw a friend's baby shower here and it went pretty smoothly. We made reservations well in advance, and it was a small party. I'm not a huge fan of their food but it's always busy so clearly other people don't have my same opinion. The three stars is for the service, they were super attentive and everything was taken care of for our party. I just don't think the cheesecake is that great, I'm sorry! But the apps aren't too bad.
3 We've been in the market looking for a church for the family to start attending. Chandler Christian seemed to be a nice offering since they are located fairly close to the house and have a decent size to offer something for each group (parents & children).  I've gotten some good reviews from a family that I know that attends.  I LOVE that they have a service on Saturday, as that is ALWAYS a plus for me.The sermon for today was an interesting one, and it seemed to be relevant and on topic for today.  The pastor took an updated slant to the story to make it a bit more relevant to today's time.  My husband was even laughing at the pastor's jokes.  My mother-in-law even commented on how she liked the music.  I did notice that the verses that they pulled up were not the verses that I remember.  I believe it's due to them using a different version.All of this being said, the service seemed to be a good one. The signage indicated that this was non-denomination; however, the service reminded me one Baptist services from childhood.
other I have attended several performances at the MCA and enjoyed them all.  The physical facilities are top notch and the outdoor areas (when the weather is accommodating) is lovely.
other This restaurant was just okay to me.  I ordered a thin crust and it was just average.  The garlic cheese bread was the best part of the meal. It was tasty.  The staff was friendly, so that was a plus.
other Look it upsets me that you have to give even one star. I can read the other reviews and I have been here more than a few times but tonight it was just beyond a bad dinner. Yes, we were the table of 7 people at about 8pm, yes we were group at the high top tables that were pushed together. You would have to remember us because we were the table that had 1/other of a waiter. It was so nice of you to take the time to take our order and then let the waiter go home because he had been there since lunch. You know what sucks more than working other shifts? How about being the last table for the guy who worked other shifts, it was so nice of the manager to let him leave, but hey how about taking the time to have someone FINISH the open orders? Simply the food was not good and you are over priced.But the worst part is that your staff is just not good at their job, THEY DONT CARE and that is a result of MANAGEMENT not caring.
other What an awesome neighborhood bar. I brought my little brother here when he was in town and the service was spectacular. For entertainment they have pool, darts, games and music. Our waitress Chris was more than attentive. I will defiantly be coming back!
other I ordered my custom made door and it arrived recently for installation. The design was exactly to specifications, quality of construction and the finish are flawless. It took several months to get but it was worth it. This one improvement has increased the value of my home and makes my entire family feel safer.
other I wish I could review the cold food stand attached to this restaurant separately because I want to tell any and all persons who think to stop by for quick sandwich to stay far, far, away from the tuna. I thought nothing was worse than slowly starving on my flight back home, but I found it in the form of this cold, barely-recognizable-as-food sandwich. I think I'd prefer eating tuna out of the can over this.
other I love love Barrio Cafe. The food is amazing and it is very cute and artsy.
other OK, let's face it: there are better steaks in the Valley. As a matter of fact, if you just took the steak at face value, it might not even crack the top 5. But Durant's is not just about the steak, or even the food. Durant's is a classic in every sense of the word, the type of place that can rarely be found anywhwere in Phoenix. It's also a lively and classy night spot, something that didn't exist anywhere in downtown Phoenix for years, and as several new places have developed around Durant's overe the past few years, it has remained consistent and cool. And that's what Durnat's is really about. Yeah, the steak is pretty good. The seafood's alright. The bread with the hot garlic butter is awesome. But Durant's is just COOL. It's classic Vegas, Rat Pack-style cool, and you feel it from the moment you walk in.
other I stayed at the hotel and I tried Tuscany and it was really good.  Delicious Scallops and pasta.  Also the pizza was excellent.  The server was great and I would return to this restaurant when I visit the hotel again.
3 ok experience, just got to a point I did not want my membership anymore and it was complicated to stop it all. I just did not like the autopay committment.
other I came in here wanting and expecting this place to be amazing.  I wanted this place to be other stars. ugh, I feel like a failure for giving it 2.  I've heard such good things about this place, and was expecting it to be good, but unfortunately, it was not.  :-(I walked in and placed my order.   The menu seems to be decent enough, with a fair amount of selection.  Ample amounts of toppings, and you can have your burger a few different ways. Mind you, I'm a burger lover, so I'm always up for places like this.I ordered a regular burger with all the fixings and BBQ sauce on top.  I got the fries too.  It came in a brown bag..I guess thats how they serve it regardless if you eat in or not.I was dissappointed with the burger itself.  It seemed like it came with way to much topping. I mean, like an overwhelming amount.  I ate it, and the burger was okay, but not as good as I have experienced at other comparable places.  I wasn't looking to be "blown away" by the burger, but I wasn't really impressed over all.  It wasn't that great, to much on the toppings, and it didnt really do much for me.  I will say tho, you get a TON of fries tho.I left feeling underwhelmed, and don't know that I will be back in the future.
other A chain, yes. But par for the course, no. First of all, they have an extensive wine list, which includes a rare type of sparkling wine, called Brachetto. In this area, DUI's are more common than a cold, and it's a light and tasty wine, with a low alcohol content. So it's option is great for me. It also goes great with everything they serve, because of it's unique flavor profile.Lizzie was our waitress, and offered options and suggestions, which actually saved us quite a bit of money on the whole. Not that, by any stretch of the imagination, is this a place to go when you are not intending a big splurge. This is a place to take it slow and spend slightly over a decent amount. The food, however, is absolutely worth it. We tried the Cheddar fondue, which could have used a bit more mustard powder and worstershire sauce, but on the whole was delicious. It was well prepped, and Lizzie explained what she was adding and why the whole time. The veggie selection is a bit mundane, and that's really my only complaint. We ate the "big night out" prix fix menu and chose the "Fusion" option which had lobster tail, shrimp, brats, ravioli, new york strip, sirloin steak, and a marinated chicken. We cooked it in the Boullion method which is just a flavored broth. Because it's not oil, you do need to add 30 sec to a min to the suggested cook times, but it was a lot lighter than using the oil and we didn't come home smelling like oil. The california salad was incredible. It had mixed greens, sliced roma tomatoes, chopped pecans, and blue cheese crumbles with a rasberry black walnut dressing. It's been a long time since I was able to truly enjoy a salad, and this was amazing. The chocolate we chose was the Smore. It was milk chocolate, marshmallow creme flambeed with grahm cracker bits added after the fire goes out. It's served with other types of coated marshmallows, pound cake, a slice of cheese cake, and a bowl of sliced strawberries and bananas. Just enough to fill us up, but we didn't overstuff ourselves. Our dinner was leisurely paced and took us about other to other 1/other hrs to get through. This is pretty normal for fondue. You do have the option of sitting at the bar and having just a cheese or chocolate, if you are on a time constraint though. It's located in a great little shopping and dining area that wasn't too crowed last night, but I think that was more due to the weather, than the actual popularity of the place.
other Love this place...can't beat it for a healthy meal. Tons of good options that are tasty without all the cheese.
3 It's the kinda place where you're certain the employees don't spit in your food.Best Taco Bell I've been to.
other 3other minutes... No food. You be the judge.
other F72other She didn't even look at me, didn't bother asking why I was entering her place of business, didn't reply when I spoke and in no way acknowledged that I was even in her presence. Just handed me a ticket and was done with me. If this happened anywhere else, I would make an effort to never return, tell all my friends how horrible this experience was, and write a scathing review about the deplorable customer service of this business. Sadly, this was my Saturday morning at the DMV, a place I think is modeled after the agonizing depths of Hell. With the same musac score playing...and the same voracious stench in the air..and the same spastic children running around (only in my version of Hell, it's politicians campaigning around me). So, I was already running late because I had to complete my emissions test early. Those nice people there not only told me there were only three DMVs open on Saturdays, they gave me a map. How precious. I was fortunate enough to be near one of the only DMVs open on Saturday (Seriously? Three DMVs open on Saturday for the entire Valley?) After receiving such a magnificent welcome, I knew this was quickly going to be among the most painful experiences of my life. To simplify what was so bad, let me make a list of what I feel constitutes acceptable behavior in public: 1) Bathe. The combination of water and soap, along with massaging the skin, creates an outcome that is most pleasing. Be sure to scrub behind your ears and reference this website about another notorious spot : http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/htf/755891987.html 2) Sit still. Yes, I know we're all waiting here for about an hour. But tapping your foot, rocking back and forth in your chair or bouncing your leg aren't going to make time go any faster. Trust me, I was watching the clock. If you feel anxious, get up and walk around. 3) Leash your children. If they cannot sit quietly, leave them in the car. It's winter, they'll be fine. It's not cute when your little monster is running up and down the aisles with his honey bun squeezing out between his fingers. It's even more not cute when he fake-falls five times in a row right in front of me. 4) Maintain quiet tones and ensure appropriate conversations when taking/making calls. To the lady behind me, I'm sorry you're not that experienced in stripping. The first thought that popped into my mind was you had a failed audition for Le Girl. Thanks to your continued conversation, I was able to figure out you were a woodworker. 5) Acknowledge the humans around you. Yeah, I get it. I'm not that big. In fact, if I turn sideways I disappear. But, I'm still right in front of you so pay attention, quit bumping in to me and hitting my leg. Unless that was flirting, in which case you really need to find someone more your level. Oh, the DMV: You have a brilliant recipe for dashing dreams and gutting humanity. And you manage to do it in a painfully lit room that reeks of a combination of my brother's old gym shoes and my dad's dirty underwear. There has to be an award for that, but I don't have the motivation to research it. Oh, and F72other was my number upon entering. I spent and hour and 1other minutes looking at that slip of paper. Just so you know, that one star is for the website (which should probably get 3-other stars but anchors like this oft sink the ship).  Le sigh... Open T-Sa 8:00am - 5:00pm; information only after 4:30pm
other You Say Potato, I Say ChicagoBy The RueOld Chicago is where I ate,I would probably by lying,If I said it was great.Lunch special calzone for $7.99,By the time I left there,My big hairy belly was doing fine.You're probably thinking "eww that's nasty",Like Magnum P.I. it rules,The waitress wasn't sweet or sassy. Inside that finely browned bread pouch,I had it stuffed with pineapple and jalapeno,Unfortunately my mouth didn't say "ouch". If you're reading this and rolling your eyes,It's okay, I'm not here to entertain you,I'm just here to eat pies. End
other I must hand it to them at Olive and Ivy! First rate atmosphere and food.The pesto is the most flavorful I have ever had and that includes pesto I have eaten in Italy.Wine selection is terrific. The breakfast, lunch and dinners are wonderful. The bar feels a bit like a meat market but that is the only down side.It is beautiful, clean and worth returning to again and again.
other Yum! I was a fan of Grimaldi's...but this place surpasses them! We had half chicken tuscana (garlic cream sauce) and half chicken artichoke (pesto sauce). Amazing! Great flavors! Usually, I'm a fan of ranch on pizza fan (don't hate)--not needed here!Comes with the traditional crust, which was really enjoyable, but also available w/thin crust or wheat crust ($other extra for wheat).Server (Zach) was nice, offered suggestions, and was on top of things. Kind of soft spoken, given the tv's and other restaurant noise. Hostess seemed like she was pretty excited to be there and everyone was polite.Prices weren't too bad--$18 for a large pizza, $8 for an individual. Variety of toppings, salads, appetizers, calzones, and drinks. Beers ranged from $3.75-$other for the 16 oz. Excited to go back and try some more pizza!
other I have to say I am not a big Valentine's fan. I don't like Hallmark holiday's. We ended up by chance going to MiMi's for Valentine's Day and they had a great menu and price for that menu for the evening. I am just impressed by their service, portion size and just the overall experience. I just love this place.

other Mmmmmm...why did I wait so long to try this????  Unbelievable pizza!!!!!!!!!!  I would give other stars, bjt the service was...well, not great.  Its ok, we all have off days.  We'll be back!!!!
other Great fresh food Great people Great price... support your local businesses!!!
3 My boyfriend, myself, and his 3 year old foster sister met up with his mom, dad, and other year old foster sister. We were all heading up to Prescott this past Saturday (1/30) to play in the snow. When we got there, they were already set up with drinks & pancake balls (strange, yet greasy & delicious). They'd placed our orders as well since they texted us for them when we were still 15min or so behind them. The food was good. The service was just okay this time since I can't remember if anyone ever came to give refills on anyone's drinks. I know they came by and asked if everything was okay a few times, but that was it. Still, friendly staff. The bathrooms weren't anything spectacular, but it's a bathroom...at a Denny's. Anyways, we all left full and went on about our day.
other My daughter and I got a recommendation from our nail tech at Scottsdale nails. WE LOVE VIETNAMESE FOOD and I was so glad to find this place. It is as good as what I used to get in Oakland, CA. The location is a little strange but once you are inside the interior is nice and tranquil and the service is very friendly. We enjoyed our noodle soup and spring rolls and we will be back for more!
other We live in the neighborhood so were excited to see a new place with a huge range of beers open up.The decorations are a bit sparse, but we like to sit on the patio or the conversation areas near the bar, which are perfect this time of year. Yucca chips are personal favorites, as is the gnocchi bolognese. Burger wasn't bad, but a burger is just a burger. They're still adjusting their menu it seems, which I expect any place to do for the first few weeks as they settle in.I really love their commitment to craft beer, especially Arizona beers. $other pitchers of AZ beer before 5:00 is not only quite a tasty offering, but appeals to my love of all things local.Give OHSO a try!
other Tried to get ahold of this dude to no avail. No personal message on his answering machine at all. Website sucks for information to let me know what sorta work or quality thereof he does.I tried to call here @ 6:53pm tonight and again...no one picks up the phone. So fed up with flaky contractors. Do they want work or not?
other The margarita pizza is awesome. They use a delicious red sauce that I would be happy to eat on noodles- much different than a lot of pizza places that just use a tasteless red goo. Good crust too! The organic root beer is pretty gross though.
other Congratulations on opening the Gilbert location. Glad to see you guys making the shift to the far East Valley. As to be expected, the bruschetta was great. We really enjoyed the Syrah and the Sangiovese. It's really hard to beat the $other glass/pitcher deal before 5pm, and the board + bottle ($20) on Monday and Tuesday night make for the perfect date night, though it can prove to create a long wait.It was nice to see staff from the other locations making the move out here. Small mishaps and things that get confused in the midst of opening a new restaurant are bound to happen. No worries though, we've been other times in the first 10 days, showing that you guys are right on target. Looking forward to getting to know the staff and becoming weekly regulars.
other The new location is big, open, and a bit more like a dinner spot rather than a mish-mosh diner. But that's just aesthetics, I realize.The food is great. I had the pad thai and tried one of the duck dishes. I'm not a huge fan of duck, but this was nice and tender and the sauce was amazing. Whatever sauce it had on it was composed of peppers, mushrooms and ground pork, if that helps you find it on the menu. The drunken dragon is also fabulous, and at $7 for lunch and $10 for dinner, Yupha's a steal. I just finished the other half of my pad thai a minute ago. Yum.I think it's my favorite Thai in the greater campus area, but then I thought about it and, isn't most of the good food in the Phoenix area in the Tempe area? I think so. Anyway, Yupha is one cool lady and you can tell they're trying hard with this grand opening. A little ass-kissing is nice, but then again, places like these are for regulars, so I guess they don't have to be overly nice to me. I'm just here to grub.EAT HERE. And ask for twice the spicy you would normally. The medium is not spicy and the thai hot is medium.
other I am definitely quite shocked at some of these reviews. I disagree with the lack of flavor, and the tasteless dishes some reviewers experienced while eating here. I recently moved over to the N. Phoenix area, and while craving some Vietnamese food a few months back, I decided to  browse "Yelp" to find it. I came across these reviews, and decided to check it out regardless of the poor comments of this establishment. I phoned in my order without looking at a menu,  ( Chicken Pho, Egg Rolls,& Spring Rolls) nor  knowing where they were even located, I eventually found it in the little nook of the Fry's shopping center. I walked in to a very tiny little restaurant  with a cute little man standing at the cash register holding my wonderfully smelling  food in hand. When I got home, I realized that he had forgotten to add the Noodles (which obviously is the  biggest part of this dish) I was a little miffed but eventually got over it, once I tried the appetizers we ordered,and the wonderful flavor of our pho. I knew it was such a harmless mistake so I didn't hold it against them. After consuming our wonderful and inexpensive meal I came to the realization that THIS is my new Fav Vietnamese spot in the N Phoenix area.. I've eaten their at least other times since I found this place in Jan. That says something in my mind!! In my opinion they  beat Pho Bang, and Avina HANDS DOWN!!  It's clean, inexpensive, flavorful, and definitely NOT tasteless.. A definite treat if you ask me. Speaking of which I think I'll order some now :o)
other I would rather go to Benihana to be honest. I have been here a few times because its so convenient but has never been worth it in the end. I have eaten here and had dinner to go it always takes forever and it is not cheap I expect cheaper if theres no atmosphere or really good food would make up for it. I have not gotten sick from the sushi here but lets just say I didnt feel so hot after eating here the last time. I looooove sushi and its hard to say that I wont be back here but I'd rather drive a bit farther and skip running the risk.
other Yummy yummy yummy! Absolutely loved it - kick back, quiet, people nice, not crowded and breakfast was crazy yummy!
other Ok, so iv been a Starbucks junkie for years....until i discovered dutch bros! This location is my favorite, although they are all good. My favorite thing about dutch is you can order ANY blended drink sugar AND fat free. You cant do that with any frappes at starbucks. You cant beat their customer service either, all the employees and incredibly nice and upbeat, always greeted with a smile! I once ordered a blended double coc coffee and it was too frothy for my liking so i stopped at the location in tempe since i was going that way to order a new one..they exchanged my drink, apologized and sent me off with a new drink at no charge. added bonus is the stamp cards, so if your an avid coffee drinker like me, you'll be saving some money to. Quick drive-through for on the go.
other Place was great the first time I went, Second time one of Dan's fair weather buddies (thinking he was big shooter) disrespected a good friend of mine over a misunderstanding that could have easily been solved through civil conversation, but he tried to be Mr. Big Shot.  The food was good, but not good enough to put up with that crap ever again.
other I don't think I have ever been to a restaurant where I have treated so poorly by the wait staff. I'm actually rethinking my Green rating because I sincerely think this is my worst restaurant experience.The one good thing I can write is that this place is really cute and it has an inviting patio. Lots of string lights and cute bistro tables. I really thought I was in for a great evening. Oh how wrong I was.My friend and I walked in and the hostess immediately sat us at a four top right in front of the door. Unless the restaurant is packed and the drafty table in front of the door is the last spot available, I do not want to sit in a place where incoming guests will constantly bump into my chair. I pointed to a seat in the back and after trying to convince me I didn't want *that* table, the hostess led us to the back. It's not the worst thing that could ever happen and that instance did not ruin my evening, it was just weird.We sat and were greeted by our waitress, who initially seemed very nice. We both ordered water to start and I asked her for a drink menu. Apparently the drink menu is on the back of the regular menu. It's just so small that I missed it the first time. She told me that Friday night is the $other frozen house margarita night, so I went with her suggestion. By the time I finish pulling out my ID, my dining partner was ready to order. We got a queso appetizer, the vegetarian tacos with a side salad, and the machaca plate.While we waited, a few more groups came in, were greeted, and received their adult beverages. It had been ten minutes since I ordered my drink, so I tried to look for our waitress. She finally popped up five minutes later, but avoided all eye contact with our table. When she did see me, she quickly ran outside. I understand she might have had a few tables outside, but why have an inside section to wait as well? The table right next to us had an amazing server who brought them two orders of drinks in the time it took to get my water glass refilled. (Margarita was still MIA at this point.)Then, the queso came out, brought by two hipsters. It looked like an over-microwaved styrofoam plate in a skillet and tasted just as bad. My friend tried to make the best out of the situation, but I was ready to call the manager. I really, really regret that I did not. Nasty queso juice dripped all over the table and there was no silverware or napkins to be found. AND no wait persons or a hostess to ask for said items. (Twenty minutes after I ordered my margarita, it was still MIA.)Our waitress finally popped up and asked how the appetizer was. My friend cut me off and said it was different, but okay. He took rare this opportunity to ask for silverware. The waitress made an excuse that it should have been on the table already and went to grab some.  When she came back, I asked about my drink.With another lame excuse that could have been avoided if she ever check on us in the then-thirty minute absence, she finally brought me my drink. It was OKAY, not worth $4... more like $2-3. Two seconds later, the food came out. At least we had silverware?1) My veggie tacos and side salad were okay. Is it bad that the BEST part of meal was the white, iceberg lettuce salad?2) My friend's machaca was bone dry. Isn't machaca supposed to be tender, rehydrated, and edible? All in all, the salsa was the best part of the meal. Yet, one cannot enjoy a dining experience on salsa alone. This was sincerely my worst experience at a restaurant and I will not go back to Mucho Gusto.
other Alice Cooperstown is owned by rocker Alice Cooper and is a pretty unique sports bar in downtown Phoenix. Cooperstown was also featured on Man vs. Food.The most unique item and the biggest draw on the menu is the "Big Unit" hot dog. This is by far the biggest hot dog that I've ever seen and the reason that I went to Cooperstown.The Big Unit is a other pound, 2other inch long Vienna hot dog, on a baguette roll. You can choose any combination of 9 toppings for the Unit. I went with cheese sauce, jalapenos, bacon, and tomato. The dog had a good taste to it and the bread was fresh. I loved the cheese sauce and bacon, but would probably go without the jalapenos next time. Surprisingly I was able to finish the entire dog, but had to really force the last four or five bites down. I've never felt fuller in my life.Unique restaurant and menu along with good food gives Cooperstown other stars.
3 Average airport. I wish gate Marques listed which zone was boarding. There were three airplanes loading at the same time and it was near impossible to tell which gate was loading which zone. We just waited a few minutes and rolled the dice that our zone was loading.
other The "chicken burger" with jerk sauce was gross. It was dried out with terrible flavor. The only saving grace was that it was small, which says enough right there. As another reviewed said, it was a ground chicken patty when I was expecting a grilled chicken breast after going to places like Johnny Rockets where I believe they have a similarly named section of the menu that refers to chicken breast sandwiches. I realize I have myself to blame on that misunderstanding, but it was still a terrible sandwich.
3 I ordered a thin crust for carry-out one evening.  The place was somewhat hidden in an industrial area close to Tempe Marketplace.  The staff was very friendly and it seemed like a laid-back, cozy place to eat a meal.I enjoyed my pizza.  The sauce tasted very sweet so be prepared for that.
other As far as Peter Piper Pizza's go, this one is pretty awesome!  Yes, you have the kids running around everywhere.  Yes, you lack gourmet pizza.  But, uh, HELLO.  It's Peter Piper Pizza.  I happen to like (not love) the pizza here, maybe it stems from it being rooted in me as a child.  Anytime we go dining with children under 13 in tow, this is always a great choice.  The kids eat, they play, they tire themselves out and they come home with a bunch of cheap crap they bought with their tickets that cost me triple what it would of cost at the dollar store with regular grown-up money versus tokens and tickets. Anyhow.....I'm a fan of this particular location because:1) The place is spacious enough that you are not run down by little people on your way to pick up your order. 2) They keep tables, play areas and restrooms very clean.3) Service is satisfactory.4) Play area, arcade games, carousel are all in great condition - nothing torn, falling apart or borderline condemned like other Peter Piper restaurants.5) They have several 3other inch TV's hanging in case you want to catch a particular game while the kids are playing.6) And, again, the pizza is really not that bad.
other This little spot in the art district of Scottsdale is as good a lunch restaurant as I've been to.  I had the mahi mahi tacos, and was blown away by the attention to detail in the flavors bringing the dish together, as well as the wonderfully tasteful presentation.  Of particular note was the attractiveness level of the waitresses, about which I don't have sufficient words to do justice.  Both my father and I were hard pressed not to buy a condo in Scottsdale just to stay and have all our meals for the rest of our life there solely to appreciate the view.  They were dressed tastefully, not in the slightest bit 'slutty', but holy god.
3 I've been to this location several times but I'd rather be more positive than nit-picky.  The service has always been a bit slow and less informative.  I've come in and on several occasions lost out on the specials till the very end when the server mentions "next time you should do the...." well I wish I would've known that earlier because I could've enjoyed more awesomeness!  Otherwise I love the atmosphere and the seating.  The space is really good, outdoor seating during this time of the year is jam and ambience are spot on for a group or a more datish type situation.  I've tried a few of the dishes and the food is pretty good but nothing yet that I've built up a craving for.  I'll be back soon for the Tuesday special of an app with a bottle of wine for $2other buckaroos!
other Very authentic, excellent Thai food and soothing ambience. And they have delivery! My favorites are the Fried Shrimp Rolls, Egg Rolls, Clear Noodle Soup, Pad Thai Chicken, Phad-See-Ew Beef, Papaya Salad, etc.. I love the Sweet Rice with Thai Custard. It tastes exactly like the Filipino custard I grew up with.
other Mini burgers aren't a new idea or anything, but I have a habit of showing up to a restaurant starving and over ordering, so if a place can take care of the portion control for me I'm pretty pleased.  The food is great - normally I get a Buffalo burger with sweet potato fries, and sometimes I'll toss in a Sloppy Joe for sentimental reasons, but the bartender Marshal has got to be one of my favorite parts. Always friendly. Comfortable place that's great for happy hour or as a stop during your normal Old Town rotation.
other By now you've heard the adventures at the Rustler's Roost ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/rustlers-rooste-phoenix#hrid:_gYib8eA4hDfylSs17Zc_g ). But my adventures in Phoenix didn't end there. My BGF had been hounding me for days to find some great "Q." He was convinced that AZ would have great "Q" on every corner. Now referring back to the link above, I admit that I had a wee hangover at the time. Anyway, I'll press on. We chose this place because BGF thought that this would be the spot. I ordered the roast garlic chicken and realized with my first bite that I had died (most likely alcohol poisoning from the night before) and was now in heaven. This was the best freakin chicken that I ever tasted. Of course I'm in heaven and BGF is grousing about the "Q" not being any good. Now I've listened to this all week from him. - This Q is too Spicy - This Q is too wet - This Q won't fall off the bone - This Q doesn't have the right flavor. I'll admit it, I snapped. (And I didn't forgive him for about other weeks). I went up one side and down the other. If you don't like the gosh darn (loosely translated) Q in AZ, the quit ordering the Blankity Blank (translation again) stuff. Needless to say, I got quite the look from BGF and boss. Boss was actually laughing at us. Anyway, I took pity on my BGF and shared some of my chicken, and he fell in love (I don't know why, it wasn't a rooster - oops, I digress). Anyway, it was decided then and there, this is the best chicken around, hands down.
other The pizza was crisp and delicious. The place is super casual and very comfortable. The staff is down-to-earth and friendly.I loved the live music from Tom Mein on the patio. It felt great to be able to sit on the patio and enjoy a downtown Phoenix sunset in the spring.Having beer and wine for sale was nice as well. I will be back to try more of the menu.
other i always forget about this place when we do a party. they carry costumes and party gear year round...even halloween stuff. stopped in today to look for a flintstones costume but they had no Fred's and the wilma they had for 50 bucks, we bought on-line for 30 bucks. i had an online coupon for 1other bucks so i only bought house decor for halloween. but if you need any kind of prop for a costume/theme party, bike pub ride, or just feel like dressing up, this place is perfect!
3 This Safeway holds a special place in my heart. It is only a block away from my house, the shelves are always stocked and it never seems to be busy.  There is a pharmacy (and they are quick!), meat counter, floral department, bakery and a Starbucks kiosk.  The staff is friendly, though often in no rush to get customers on their way.  There are some great deals to be had here...just don't forget your discount card.  Without it the prices are downright unreasonable, hence, the somewhat sad, three star rating.
other Best breakfast in the valley. Dinner sucks. Well, let's clarify a bit here. We've ordered blueberry pancakes, stuffed french toast, muffins, and a few other b-fast items. They were all stupidly good. For dinner, we've tried a couple dishes such as the recommended jumbalaya - SUCKS! Stay away from that canned garbage. Back to breakfast...dang, that's incredible!
other Try the Moroccan Chicken on the low calorie menu.  I was really surprised at how great it is.
other They have some rude employees its unbelievable. I'm trying to give business to them and ordered 6 smoothies and the cashier and her employee gave me a dirty look. Not customer friendly. At all.
3 I like the way they treat my dogs, really friendly staff.  They are really good about getting your pet seen in an emergency.  The facility itself is nice.  However, it feels as if they are always trying to sell me something things I don't need. This place is so expensive, we can never get out of there for less than $100.
other Have you not tried Which Wich yet? Do it. Buffalo chicken= hands down, my favorite sandwich ever in the world. I can't wait to get pregnant so I have an excuse to eat them every day. I used to go to one in CO all the time and I really remembered loving it- when I found out one had opened by my work, it secured a regular spot on my lunch-break rotation until I realized maybe I shouldn't be eating sandwiches all week.  I now prefer to hit up the AJ's next door for cheap tea and salad bar (healthier, obviously) but sometimes I wind up in the parking lot of AJ's only to instead go over to Which Wich... it's seriously delicious stuff. My husband love the Thanksgiving Turkey feast sandwich (probably has a cooler name than that) and my backup fave is the chicken pesto (be sure to add bacon.) Always- and I do mean ALWAYS- get your sandwich toasted. Trust me. I'm a fattie who loves her some good sandwiches.
other Not impressed and probably won't be back. I came for lunch and was immediately turned off by the lighting and décor. I sat down and began to peruse the menu when I saw "Ask server for bento box selection". I asked the server and he looked at me as though I had grown a third eye. He told me they didn't have bento boxes.. I showed him the menu to which he said "hmff that's weird". None of the lunch items on the menu struck my fancy so I ordered the lunch special. I got the chicken katsu, it was over fried, hard and dry. The accompanying mammas roll had an overwhelming mayo flavor. And guess what? It came in a bento box. There are a ton of great sushi spots in this area so Shogun really needs to step it up to be in line with their competition. (Thank God for Yasu's!)
other I have been parking here loyally for several years but the last two times have prompted me to look elsewhere. The location is somewhat good but stinks if you get stuck behind the train since it is just south of the train tracks. The shuttle are fairly frequent and prices reasonable. What has really rubbed me the wrong way is the service. Okay, maybe just one particular driver. The second to last time we used this place, it just so happened that the driver that dropped us off at the airport wrote down the wrong place. When we were taken back to the parking lot, the driver kept arguing with me and saying my location was wrong. It was to the point, he was almost ridiculing me in front of the other passengers. When we finally located my car, I showed him the ticket where the location was written. His response was that the original driver was an idiot for writing down the wrong location. No apology to me for his behavior. We used Sky Harbor during Christmas and we got the SAME driver again after being picked up and taken back to the lot. Turns out his behavior was the same and this time I watched it exhibited towards other passengers in addition to myself. My husband thought it might have been his sense of humor but yelling at other drivers in the parking lot is unacceptable. Besides this idiot's behavior, during the holiday, Sky Harbor Parking had cars parked in front and behind vehicles in middle rows. There were three couples who were blocked in when dropped off. I couldn't believe it. Who wants to deal with that when traveling all day? Thankfully, it didn't happen to us, because I would have blown a fuse after dealing with the driver. I might try out Pre-Flight who has a frequent driver program. Hopefully, their customer service is better...
other I was very excited to find this place as you will be when you walk inside and find nice clothes and accessories for even nicer prices!  There are several locations throughout the (east) valley.  Treat yourself.  You will be happy you did.
other The Good Egg is a breakfast spot I frequent on a regular basis. During the week it's hopping with folks on their lunch breaks and the weekend crowd seems to be most predominant during brunch hours.The menu offers a wide variety of items to choose from. They are only open for breakfast and lunch, but you can order any of them at any time during business hours. Pancakes of a mammoth proportion are often seen zooming by on the arm of a server. Instead of hashbrowns, homestyle fried potatoes are served on the side of most dishes.The serving staff have always been very friendly and accommodating and it makes the experience a very pleasant one every time I am there. The patio is very large and can seat many. This is especially nice during sunny days, but not so much on a cold January morning even with the large heaters operating.If you go on a weekend morning, prepare for a bit of a wait. You can sip complimentary coffee outside while waiting for your party to be called. It's always fun to give a fake name for your party as it is eventually announced over a very loud loudspeaker for the world to hear.  When you hear Captain Caveman's party being called to go take their seats, keep an eye out for me giggling somewhere nearby.
3 I hate having to give out three star reviews. For me, 1-star isn't the worst possible rating you can an establishment, a 3 is. Because 3 stars means it invoked no reaction to you, neither joy or disgust, no pleasure or pain. I'd rather eat at a really shitty place that I'll remember than a so-so eatery that I'll forget the moment I get back into my truck.If I want mediocre "take it or leave it" food I'll just cook for myself, kthxbye.As BFeF's (Best Frienemies Forever), Clarice W and I frequently have lunch together in the Peoria area. The decision on what to eat is usually made using the following criteria: Where haven't we been that we can yelp about?Our last lunch involved us going to Hope Kee and getting all wrapped up in their cutesy snack section and coming in late to work. So we needed somewhere relatively closer with no Hello Kitty gummi lips to distract us from our voyage back.Clarice suggested Casa Filipina, a Filipino place by the Lenny's Burger somewhere near but not necessarily 35th Avenue.We were welcomed in by the staff and taken immediately to a nice cozy table by the window. We were given our menus by the excited and talkative waiter I would come later to know as "that fucking guy". At first I was a little troubled reading the menu. I was once in a relationship with a Filipino girl that was so tumultuous and unloving that when I seriously thought of breaking up with her that my first thought "but  man, I love her mother's cooking...". But aside from the adobo and lumpia, I saw nothing else on the menu that I could recall from all those awkward awkward family dinners.I can't tell if this means there's more to the cuisine than I'm aware of or that said ex's mother was, as well as a good cook, a fucking liar. Either way, I'm glad I left her in the end anyway.I ordered the Dinguan, which translates as "chocolate pork".Don't be fooled by the name, all you saucy foodies out there thinking of that Iron Chef America where they made savory dishes with chocolate.Chocolate pork is actually pork cooked in pig's blood. I'll repeat that.It's pig's blood. It's called "chocolate pork" because the blood takes on a brownish-black hue after it's been cooked.After hearing this from that fucking guy, Clarice changed her original order (we even order the same thing! aren't we just the cutest!) to the Bistek Tagalog, which she was familiar with and knew she would like.All the entries come with at CFB is a side of ride. I'm not sure if it's jasmine, white, or saffron, because I always opt for noodles when given the option. And if you get that fucking guy, that rice doesn't even come with soy sauce. After serving us, he disappeared into the bakery, talking it up with some of the other customers. Clarice didn't get her soy sauce until after we had finished our entrees and were on our second helping of rice. Thankfully my chocolate pork came with a lot of sauce and I was able to dribble it on my rice. That's right, muchachos. We trannies prefer blood on our rice. You think about that the next time you try to tell us what bathrooms we can use, amigo.I couldn't taste the pork. All I tasted was the blood. They could've just dumped a quart of blood on my rice and called it a day. The texture was nice though.Clarice wasn't as fortunate with her dish. While I've tried to stay away from beef (it's enough of a commitment to keep my vegetarian brother off my back but not interfere with my eating habits), I had some of the Bistek, and it was passable. It reminded me of beef jerky, with its dry spicy roughness. Good, but not sure if that's how it's meant to taste.Moral of the story: Clarice's entree did NOT make its own gravy, which made eating her rice a little inconvenient. And seriously, JUST rice (really good rice, but seriously, how hard is it to make good rice)? Even my neighborhood so-poor-it-steals-its-recipes-from-other-restaurants Chinese place gives you an eggroll or wonton with your meal. As the place is so fucking proud of its desserts, we ordered some. Clarice got the Creme Brulee and I got the mango tart. That fucking guy was in the middle of bringing Clarice her spoon when he caught the attention of another customer, so we sat for a good few minutes waiting to dig in. In the meantime, I managed to come up with a name for the color of the filling in my tart : burnt earwax. My tart was about as tasty and edible as that term would imply.Clarice's creme brulee was good, albeit a little cold by the time that fucking guy came with her spoon.On our way out I learned that the bill had to be over 10 dollars before they would accept debit.After I imagined beating every one of the staff near to death with a rolling pin, I got an eclair to go.What I got was a bunch of whipped cream between two pieces of rock-hard pastry that you'd get at Fry's. Essentially, a diabetes sandwich.Casa Filipina isn't good. But it's not bad.That's the proble
other Had the Korean Beef over white rice. What a great dish. Thin sliced beef in a garlic brown sauce with onions and great taste, served with a side of white rice. NOTHING over the top nothing trying to be something it is not. Just good food.
other One of the perks to being an only child, is "me" time. There is something special about having time to yourself, when the only obligation you have is to check in on Yelp, leave a quick tip, and grab a lemonade from the mall because it is 109 degrees outside.Yesterday was that day. I had stumbled across The Art of Shaving. I've been in their stores in other cities before. Of course I have...because if you look at any of my pictures, you will realize a couple things: 1. I'm vain. 2. I'm hairless.As soon as you step foot into this store, you are in a true gentleman's club. Not the kind that will take all your dollar bills. You won't make it rain here.This is the ultimate shaving store. Soaps, creams, blades, razors, balms, brushes, and mugs. You name it, they have it.The staff knows what they are talking about. I explained to them that I have a very old safety razor and a brush. Both were passed down by my Grandfather who passed away when I was a teenager.They didn't pressure me into buying ANYTHING, although I did end up leaving with some shaving cream. They even gave me a proper demo on how to use it properly with my brush. I've been used to shaving soaps and the usual aerosol creams....so the little tutorial was nice.Also, there is a master barber in the back of the house that does straight razor shaves, haircuts, and men's facials.Remember earlier when I said that "me" time is a perk? This is the best place to spend it if you are a dude.If you are a woman, buy your man, or your man-friend a gift from here. This place is simply amazing.One last warning. The store is pricey. but worth every single penny.
other I just love Chipotle. Fresh, yummy, spicy (if you want it to be). And the restaurant was clean a HUGE plus! My personal fav is the chicken burrito, no rice, no beans w/ fajita veggies, pico, cheese, sour cream, and lettuce. Guacamole and hot sauce on the side. So delicious!!! The person who did our order was so nice! It was my friend's first Chipotle experience! She was impressed by how big the burrito was. I'm glad I only live a few blocks away... because I will be back.
other OMG! what is the rave about? this place is disgusting! it's dirty and the food is not worth it! i came here with my family and we each order a little bit of everything that is suppose to be good and popular there. unfortunately everything is bad. i walked by the waiters and they were all cursing really loud in vietnamese to each other. the table is icky and it smell like my cooked up oil . ick! go to Pho ao sen instead at least it's clean.
other Took the family to the recent opening of this local Logan's Roadhouse to check it out and maybe find a new local 'gem'. Initial impressions were that Logan's is an imitation of one of my favorite family steakhouses, Texas Roadhouse. We go there every chance we can and have never been disappointed in the quality of food or service. Anyway back to Logan's, atmosphere was 'okay' (again a wannabe Texas Roadhouse but not quite right), service was fine, but once the food came, that 'sealed the deal' - very disappointing. Not that it was bad or anything, but the quality of the steaks just wasn't anywhere close to what you get at Texas Roadhouse, and when the prices are about the same, well, there's just no sense wasting time or money here. You might think I'm being rough but when all 3 of my kids (ages 7-11) say that they like Texas better, that's gotta say something (they usually never say anything bad - they usually just eat whats in front of them!)So by now you can obviously guess that I don't recommend Logan's.  I really only have one more thing to add.........Don't mess with Texas.....
other Go here frequently, and have never ran into any of the issues other's have yelped about...Best rollsVegasDamn goodSpicey cowboy/cowgirlI like sashimi...but unless I'm someplace where it just came out of the water...I'm not eating it...so can't comment on that.We usually go late in the afternoon and have always had good service and once we had a birthday party with 1other people on a busy night..My Only complaint is the bathroom...it needs some work.....and I do not like hearing employees talking on their cell phone while sitting on the toilet.
3 Came to Blanco Tacos during Restaurant Week 2009. The guacamole they served with the chips was so yummy! The flan was also delicious. I will come back just to eat the flan! The scene was pretty cool. Fun people watching environment.
other I'm really not the type to want to go out for breakfast, I'd rather save my dining money for lunch or dinner because I figure I can usually make just as good of a breakfast at home.  However, there is no way I could match their french toast, it is just outstanding.  We have been twice and I ordered that both times.  The first time, I told the waitress to put the berry sauce on the side because I usually don't like fruit toppings, they are too sweet and fake tasting.   But this sauce is delicious! It is homemade and very natural tasting, I ate every bit of it.  We also loved the jalepeno bacon.  My kids loved the pigs in a blanket.  We had very nice service both times, we will definitely be back!
other I was really looking forward to eating here this morning when I got to the restaurant and found that everything was super clean and nice looking. I had been drinking all night and it was time for some breakfast. They had a great selection of hot tea. The people in my party got quite a few things and everything came in heaping portions. The French toast is the super thick kind and very fluffy. They also proved that they can really cook eggs well. They also brought lots of coffee and hot water for all of us.I also go their chicken tortilla soup and it was AMAZING.The service was super fantastic! I will definitely come here again. :)
3 I feel bad for this park. Its nice. Really nice. The only problem is its in Phoenix where it is hot like heck. That means the roof is always closed. And with the roof closed, it almost feels like you are watching baseball inside of an auditorium.
other Another excellent find in Scottsdale.  The service is wonderful and the food is extremely flavorful with good size portions.  The sea scallops and herb chicken are highly recommended.
other It's really easy to write reviews about places like D'licious Dishes.  This was my second visit since Petite Fromage sadly closed.  This time, I was with my mother and wife.  We each ordered a sandwich and a side salad for about $7.00 per person.  Everything was really very good.  I honestly think I would have been satisfied with only half of the cuban sandwich that I ordered, but it was so good, I had to finish it right then and there.  My wife and I are moving into a house in the Medlock Historic District, directly behind D'licious Dishes, and we have decided to make this our standing Saturday lunch spot.  I was too full to indulge in their beautiful selection of sweets, but I will be sure to dive into that area on my next visit.
other I just moved to AZ from Honolulu with my bf and found this to be a great breakfast / brunch place. They do close at 2:30pm.On my last visit, I ordered the amazing "other for you"! You get the choice of a half sandwich & either soup or salad for $7.95...WHAT A DEAL!! I ordered the  Monterey Club & the No. other Chinese salad. What an amazingly refreshing lunch! I highly recommend this day cafe, this may not be the best review, but if you stop by the line may sway you:)
other Visited the phoenix public market - open air market - farmers market they have on saturday mornings and decided to give mojo bowl a try! They are at the market for food truck fridays also. Check out their website for their usual schedule. They can take cash or credit (with square).I tried their strawberry banana smoothie and my wife had the Funky Monkey (peanut butter / chocolate blend). They were both great quality with fresh ingrediants. They serve salads, yogurt parfaits, and soup also (which I didn't try) but Ive heard their smoothies was where they shine and they did not dissapoint. Give them a try, at $5.00 for a 2other oz smoothie, you can't really complain about the price - its basically a meal itself.
other Wow this place is fabulous.  Everything is so fresh and tasty that you can enjoy a healthy and yummy meal without breaking the bank.  The salad bar is huge and they have a fresh soup bar where you can choose numerous varieties of homemade soups.  Great tasting desserts and frozen yogurt machine.  Best Strawberry Lemonade I have ever tasted.  You have to try this place you will not be disappointed.  They need to open locations in the Midwest.Also, I want to give a shout out to the server at the restaurant.  His name is Oscar and he is so wonderful and funny.  He made us all laugh and smile and Oscar is such a hard worker and everyone that visits this location has to say hello to Oscar because he is the nicest man ever!
other We stopped here on a Thursday night on a raving referral and they we not exaggerating - this place is fantastic!We are always a little hesitant to try a new place when an omnivore suggests it, but as vegetarians, we found Sekong by Night so accommodating! They offered to convert nearly any dish on their menu into a vegan alternative, and it was delicious. The spring rolls are really big, and they swapped their fish dipping sauce for a vegan version. We had the Phnom Penh Noodle Soup with tofu & veggie broth (just like the Vietnamese pho!) and the Katheaw Cha rice noodles with tofu instead of beef - AMAZING. Service was top notch, and as many other reviewers noted their prices are unbelievably low for the quantity and quality of food that you get.Looking forward to our next visit and trying more fantastic dishes!
other Went there first thing thing this morning. Ordered other simple sandwiches. Took over 3other minutes to make. 6 workers lounging around. Completely ignored. Totally disgusted with their service. Overpriced. Food okay and felt worthless when I left
other This is a great venue other than it being in the middle of nowhere.Went to see Rockband Live (The Cab, Plain white T's, Dashboard Confessional, and Panic at the Disco). A good lineup for what was pretty much a promotional event.The concert was great, the sound system and acoustics are pretty much perfect. I highly recommend seeing your favorite band play at Jobing.com arena!
3 It's a taqueria in a Latino supermarket.  Nothing special but you have choices. They will have just about everything you may like. It's not gourmet and some things are just sitting in the pans but at least you can look at what you want.I'd go back if I just needed something quick....
other Reasonable prices, good service, over-priced snacks (like every other theater) and comfy seats! I do enjoy this AMC very much though when I have to come here versus the Harkins on Northern.The one MAJOR drawback and this is a BIG WARNING is that if you go on the day of a Cardinals home game, EVERYONE and I do mean EVERYONE has to pay $10 to park in the parking lots at Westgate. The parking attendants will give you a ticket to take inside and AMC has a person there to give you back the $10 but the fact that you have to pay it to begin with sucks. What if I didn't have cash on me? This by no means is AMC's fault. I suspect it's the City of Glendale's or the Cardinal's convoluted way to soak people but at least you do get the money back if you are paying attention.
other Great food, clean a bit old but nice
other Very good food with huge portions.
other Well, for the most part, this place is average. However, there were some things that were red flags in my book. 1. Dicking us around with the room. Paid for Cabana Room with balcony. First room given - West Wing. Not Cabana. Second room given - Handicapped Cabana Room in back corner, no balcony. Since this was on my boyfriends card, and he didn't want to push for the the Cabana Balcony we wanted, there was nothing I could do. However, I find this highly unacceptable. 2. Dirty - Every morning, when we left, there were used coffee mugs and coffee pots on the floor in the area in front of the maintenance closet. 3. Maintenance crew would leave their carts in the middle of the hallway, and we would have to figure out how to move them to get by.4. Crude comment from their pool guy.5. Overall, outdated hotel. Not a good vibe at all. Average to below average service. Overall desolate.I would never stay here again, and would never recommend this place to anyone.
other Good food and great service.  Staff is very friendly and attentive without hovering.  I would definitely go back
other My husband and I visited the olive mill this morning. We decided to go there after finding reviews on here so Thankyou! It is kind of funny also since we live in Circle Cross Ranch which is just right up the road from QCOM. I have passed this building so many times and just tossed it up to another little local farm out here. First we sampled all the olives and the different oils and dipping sauces. My husband complained he thinks the products are overpriced but I thought they were reasonable since they are really good and don't taste anything like the stuff you get in the supermarkets. After selecting a few items, I bought the mesquite almond stuffed olives and lemon and blood orange olive oils. Blood orange is amazing I can't wait to try it on a salad. I also bought a plain virgin olive oil.The oil is so flavorful and their claim is it is pesticide free since they don't have a problem with some sort of fruit fly they normally have problems with in olives here because of our dry hot climate. We decided to grab a bite. This was the only problem, not for me but for my husband. I guess this is a perfect place for the girls to get together for lunch but if you have a man that has a pretty hearty appetite like mine then he may not quite be satisfied with what he receives.It was perfect for me. I ordered a paninni that had roasted squash, peppers, arugula, fennel garlic aoli and a parmesan balsamic sauce on it. It was very good. Came with a side of kettle style potato chips and some olives. He had a salad but truthfully it was not a very big salad especially with the salads that could serve 3 you mostly see these days. I guess it is true Americans have come to expect quantity.That is ok, I would definitely go back. I will just have to make sure I leave him at home next time and go with one of my gals instead
other I went to Wokee Express tonight, per my friend's suggestion. If I'm craving Chinese food, I typically go to Taste Of China. However, I wanted to try something different, so I asked around, and was directed to Wokee Express.The price of the food is great. At dinner, I got a large chicken plate combo. "Combo" means it comes with rice, egg roll, and crab puff. All of this only cost $7.75.However, the chicken was over-cooked, and the batter the chicken was fried in was soggy and mushy. There were no carrots or peas in the fried rice, which is a huge deal to me for some reason.So overall, if you're on a budget and want some good Chinese food, go to Taste Of China.
other This place is good to go, went there on a sunny saturday morning, following battling DB's at American Junkie. Had there big breakfast (forgot what it was called), and had a cup of joe and people watched. The food was awesome and the wonderful ladies of Scottsdale are entertaining, it's saturday morning and ladies are rollin in this place like it's a fashion show, to top it off one lady had to reapply her mascara a few times to make sure she was breakfast chic!! Awesome!!
other I actually love this place and I always get great service when I'm there. The tootsie roll is by far my favorite. I must say, however, that I recommend the Sakana on Power over the one on Elliot... for some reason, I like the sushi over there better...?
other I have been here twice so I know what's the best items for my taste. Would give another star if the Mongolian grill had more items and sauces. Trying the evening buffet tomorrow with other teenage son's one whose 18 and a football player. Should definitely get my moneys worth!
other Ugh.I used to like this place.But I've gotten over it.I find the food to be uninspired, and below average.Blah.
other The Vig is a breath of fresh air as far as the bar scene goes in uptown Phoenix. Nice ambiance, good vibes from both customers and employees, and overall a great concept. Anyone can come here and feel comfortable.We went for burger night (Monday night people!), not knowing what to expect... Here's what to expect: a giant effing specialty burger (3 to choose from), cooked to perfection, served with a hearty portion of fries or sweet potato fries! FOR other BUCKS!Our waiter was either stoned or really new at his job... I'll give him the benefit of the doubt even though he talked like Jeff Spicolli, and say that he was probably just new. But hey, I'm not gonna bitch on $other burger night...
other I purchased a pair of Naot Paris sandals ($160 with tax) at The Shoe Mill.  I considered buying on-line, but decided to shop locally instead.  I ended up paying more, but assumed that I was paying for the superior service.  I wore my new shoes to work on Friday.  By the end of the day, I had developed blisters on both feet near my toes and my ankles.  I was surprised because I had read many reviews stating how comfortable Naot sandals are and the salesman who helped me confirmed that I was buying the correct size.  Sadly, I took them back to the store the next day.  To my surprise, I was told that The Shoe Mill does not take returns.  I have never tried to return shoes, so it didn't occur to me to ask this question when I made the purchase.  However, as I stated, I expected full service from a high end shoe store.I will no longer shop at The Shoe Mill.  It's been three days and my feet are still recovering.  It's a constant reminder of how dissatisfied I was with my purchase.  I will definitely shop Zappos next time.
other Simply awesome! Great beer and great staff! Will try the food next time! Only complaint is a bartender named Adrianne she is crazy! Ha! GThe food was excellent from the great hard boiled egg dish to the peanut butter and jelly with banana and marshmallow fluff oh and add bacon.  Elvis just did a sommersault in his grave.  The sandwiches are not huge but they are all made like the beer served and the people hosting, of finest quality!  Really enjoyed and will spread the word!
other Some might say that Phoenix is a city without much culture.  That may be true in some aspect, however we have to remember that Phoenix is a young large city compared to other cities that lie within the United States.  So you can say that this city is a work in progress on catching up with everyone's culture expectations.The Japanese Friendship Garden in downtown Phoenix is only seven years old.  Very new to the park scene for this metro, I have to say that it looks great and will only keep getting better in time.  That will happen if people stop saying there is no culture in Phoenix and become a part of the evolving city by visiting places such as this.  The admission and or donations will fund a more desired park for all.The grounds of the garden are very beautiful with a nice flowing stream, several waterfalls, coy fish, and many species of plants.  I can't wait to go back in the next several years to see it become a wonderful masterpiece.
other I go to Regio's a lot; today I went and want to reiterate how great I think it is.  I have been going there for a couple years - have never been disappointed in anything I've ordered.  Their beans are delicious, as is their menudo (only on Saturday and Sunday, unfortunately), and eveything else: tacos, burritos, enchiladas, chile rellenos, etc, etc, etc. is great.  It is so inexpensive it's hard to believe.  Today my bff and I had other tacos and an order of beans (between us) and it was $10. HELLO! We had the mini-tacos, but we were stuffed and left there saying how wonderful it was and how full we were.  Check it out next time you're in the mood for some awesome, authentic Mexican food.  You will be glad you did.  Yummy.
other Loved it. Pulled pork & pulled chicken, bbq sauce & the cole slaw were ALL outstanding. ONLY caveat is that GPS tries to send you to thhe wrong side of the highway. It is in the shopping center with CVS & Circle K.
other Amazing. Just stopped for snacks, had the fake crab rangoons and samosas. Very good. Will mos def come back to dine, hopefully several times, when in town. Love that they sell Diaya in the cooler and other lovely products, books and junk foods!
other I have been to this place twice so far.  The first time I had no idea what to expect since I never heard of it before.  I honestly have no idea what to compare it to but I guess the closest thing is Texas Road House judging by the reviews here on Yelp.  Anyway, I know its not the classiest joint with the best food, but anything is worth a fair shot.  The first time my wife and I went we were in the area doing some shopping and just wanted something quick and casual for dinner.  We didn't expect anything great but to be honest our expectations were exceeded.The happy hour is pretty good.  $3 pints and other for other cocktails/wine.  Both times we went we ordered a other for other drink which would have been ok if they didn't charge too much for the first one.  I mean $other for a small glass of Yellow Tail?  They are giving you other though so I can't complain too much I guess.The thing we love about this place is the other meals for $13.99 special they have going on.  There are some pretty good options if you stay away from the fried stuff.  So far we have had the chop steak, steak and the salmon.  They are all very good and decently sized.  They prepare them however you want (sauce on the side, etc.) and everything comes with other sides.  There are 10 or so sides to choose from.  I get a side salad and some grilled onions or mushrooms to go with whatever meat I am having and they are always very good.  My wife always gets some sort of grilled vegetable and they are good as well. The service is very fast and friendly and the food always comes out pretty quick.  Oh yeah, and I also am a fan of their peanuts as well as the rolls that you get to start.
other Disclaimer: Like many of you, I am a sucker for charming little homes that have been re-purposed into restaurants. I am certain that this colored my opinion of Cibo.That being said, I absolutely love having lunch here the other day. I unknowingly arrived at 2:0other (other minutes after they close between lunch and dinner) but was served anyway. I had the salscicia sandwich and a side of fruit. The sandwich was excellent, served on perfectly crisp, chewy saltimbocca bread. The sausage was flavorful and was complimented by roasted red peppers and onions. All this was finished off with a great quality mozzarella cheese. Really, really delicious.I should also say that the atmosphere here was friendly and  comfortable, though a bit small. This would be a great place to hang out if you lived nearby.
other I've always been a fan of the Dilly Bird, it's just a delicious sandwich... I can't speak for all locations but the one in Mesa off of Southern was a real disappointment the other night.  I waited almost 30 minutes for a cold turkey sandwich!  After working all day and sitting in traffic for an hour the last thing I want to do is sit in a fast food joint for that long, especially when all the "kids" behind the counter are messing around talking about their homework and girlfriends or boyfriends and not working.  I have been going to this location for a dilly bird for longer than I can remember, but unfortunately I will not be returning any time soon unless someone can guarantee I wont have to sit and listen to teenagers for a half hour while I wait for a cold sandwich.
other Jesse and I had a lovely evening out- we had great dishes and the owner was our server as well. He belts out a lovely Italian birthday song while playing the guitar. Very nice
other Wish I could review this place on service but I wasn't able to get one.  Walked in at other PM on a Sunday afternoon for a mani pedi, was told by the front nail tech to have a seat.  I get it, I walked in on a Sunday afternoon so they are going to be busy and I am fine to wait.  My wait turned into 30 minutes and no one said a word to me.  Then the front nail guy tells me it is going to be another 20 minutes before someone would be able to get to me.  You know your salon, you know your techs and how long it will take them to do a service as well as how many people are in front of me so it would have been nice to have gotten a expected wait time before I wasted an hour my time.  I ended up leaving and going to another salon who saw me right away  The place in general was dirty, nail polish spilled down the wall and dust everywhere.  I did not get to see how clean their pedi baths and chairs were but the front waiting and front desk area was filthy.
other In Phoenix for a concert and felt like Thai. Found this place on Yelp! and decided to check it out based on the reviews and the fact that it was near the friend we were visiting at the time. The restaurant is in a strip shopping center that we never would have noticed (or found) had we not been looking for it. Oh, but what a magical dining experience! The cashew chicken was the best I'd ever had (and we eat Thai a LOT!) and the chicken satay was exceptional. Loved the veggie Pad Thai and my husband got a vegetarian (tofu) curry dish he loved. Wish this place wasn't 400 miles from my house. I'd be eating here every week!
other Great place for Italian food. Very family friendly. Mellow atmosphere with friendly and knowledgeable staff. Never had a bad meal. My favorite is Sirloin Marsala and you can choose any pasta they have to go with it at no charge. Recommend to anyone who enjoys quality Italian for a good price.
other Loved this place since it open but they have changed their menu up a little and it seems they have cut corners and products out of there repartee.  The sandwich I got this weekend was very bland and somewhat disappointing in portion size I've grown accustom to at the "WBC" and they've discontinued making their bread salad. (Very disappointing)  I will be back but with fewer expectations I guess.I received an apology letter from the founder and an offer to refund my money.  I don't need a refund... this is not what Yelp is about, but it was really refreshing to know that a company still cares about their customers reviews.  After re reading my review it may have sounded worse than my experience actually was.  The sandwich I got was a new one from their menu named the Spicy Chipotle Egg Sandwich, it was good but I like SPICY!!!  I may order it again and just ask for an extra egg and some more chipotle sauce.  The gentleman did give me the recipe for the salad that I've enjoyed in the past.   This type of service is what makes a customer for life.
other What can I say, this place is an Albertsons... Definitely not high-end like Whole Foods, but not bottom of the barrel either. It is always clean, bright, and organized. The selection is vast, and since I've seen things behind the scenes, I know they work hard to keep only fresh and undamaged food on the shelves. disclosure: I used to work here
other well dang gummit....git on over here and by me some camo flawj....tha kind that has little dangly moss on it....and while yur at it, i need me a gun....too bad i already have a gun and camo. i use to be a big hunter....deer, dove, turkey, squirrel, ducks etc. it's what you do in south georgia when your fridge is empty and you're hungry. this bass pro shops is ENORMOUS!!!!! i love it. although i don't hunt anymore, my brother and father do, so every year i get gift cards for them from Bass Pro Shops. the gear and guns are more expensive than other places, but their selection is incredible. when my dad comes out here, i can't wait to take him here to see all the taxidermy and fish tanks...i know he'll love it. the staff is usually friendly. the firearms dept is a bit intimidating and the guys at the counter can be smart asses. but this place is just really neat overall. it is also a family retreat, so don't be surprised to see hundreds of kids running wild while their parents let them be terrors.
other This location has closed.  Went by today and found an empty restaurant.
other I love this place. It was so beautiful over the holidays with all the lights and garlands. I think the people who run this have a lot of pride in their business. The room was clean and the beds so comfortable. The decor is rustic but elegant at the same time. I liked how close we got to park to our room...super convenient. Lots of coupons given to us at checkin too. Great experience!
other Ok, yes I am writing a review for a fast food restaurant. I realize that seems a bit strange and quite possibly extremely unnecessary. I mean, fast food is fast food right? Everyone knows what their getting into and what kind of food to expect, right? While this is true I felt it was worth writing a little snippet for the always refreshing Chick-Fil-A.It's nice to have a fast food experience where the food tastes fresh and actually like real chicken. The nuggets are yummy, flavorful but not overbreaded. My parents enjoyed their chicken sandwiches and agreed that the food is fresh tasting and not too heavy. We also enjoyed the sweet tea which is a classic Chick-fil-A staple.One important thing to note was that this location was super busy when we walked in right at noon but soon after we ordered our food was ready in a flash. And for those of you who have never been to CFA before? The icing on the cake is the wonderful assortment of dipping sauces to suit whatever flavor mood you are in at the moment. Or you can do what I do and open one of each and dip to your hearts desire. Who doesn't love variety?!
other Another lovely mom and pop with fabulous authentic thai.  The prices are very reasonable and I've never had a problem with the service.
other The guy who worked the front door Sunday night deserves to be fired. Sound harsh? Not at all. Had a supervisor overheard how he treated my friend he would have agreed.We pull up in the car.  It looks fine from the outside so we send in one of the five of us in to scope it out (check the menu, see if there's seating etc). Normal behavior. So my friend K, approaches the guy at the door and asks "what type of food is served here?" expecting a simple response like  "American" or "here let me grab you a menu."Ready for this...?? His response: "human food"HUMAN FOOD?!?!?!HUMAN FOOD!??!?!K is just an average potential customer, asking a fair easy to answer question.Okaaaaay. Being the sweetheart K is, she goes with it (it: him being a meeeeeanie) and asks if there is outdoor seating.He sarcastically, mockingly and and outright D-bagly points out how there is a seat yourself sign right nearby. How was this guy ever hired?Again a more appropriate responds (TOOL:) would have been "yea, the patio seems like it has some space tonight, AND I'D BE HAPPY TO GO CHECK FOR YOU" or "at this fine establishment it's seat yourself but usually the outside turns over quickly."  Sunday night's fine joke machine at the front door: I could happily give you several other decent responses you could have said to an innocent patron.Everyone and their mom has had some turn at being a waiter/hostess/manager/bartender etc etc in the food and hospitality industry, be it in AZ, SF, WHEREVER and KNOWS the #other 10other rule is: BE KIND TO THE GUEST(kiss@$$ , the customer is always right etc.)Add to that list: answer straightforward questions from your guests with flat out, non-acrimonious answers!Granted this review can say nothing about this establishement beyond the front door because we never made it that far.
other Great happy hour deals here! I loved the Cotija grilled corn and BBQ pork cheese crisp and was extremely jealous of my friend's order of the shrimp and corn cheese crisp that she enjoyed. Drinks were yummy and reasonable. I can't wait to come back to order that shrimp and corn cheese crisp and maybe some fresh guacamole.
other San Felipe's Cantina will always have a special place in my heart. I've been coming here since it opened, and I haven't been disappointed yet! Here's some of my favorite things about them:Happy Hour - San Felipe's has one of the best happy hours in the valley. Their drinks and appetizers are half off from 4pm-7pm, and my bill for drinks and dinner with friends is typically $20-$30. You can't beat that!Service - I usually sit up at the bar when I stop by, and they have some of the friendliest bartenders in town! They always make me feel at home when I stop by, and they're quick to serve me during the late-night hours. The managers are also really good about hanging out and chatting with the customers to make them feel special. It works!Food and Drinks - My favorite drink at San Felipe's is probably the Mexican Iced Tea. It's a long island iced tea, but they use passion fruit vodka instead of the traditional unflavored vodka. As far as food goes, I REALLY like the baja chicken wrap, the sonoran chicken sandwich, and the steak burrito with green sauce. A quick tip - ANYTHING with the baja sauce is great :)Overall, this place is a lot of fun, and I really like the laid back vibe. I'll definitely be back!
other The desserts are a little bland and are pricey given the small size.  I've had better Japanese bakery items elsewhere.
other How have I not reviewed this place on Yelp?I reviewed them for Check Please, Arizona!, a PBS review show. http://www.azpbs.org/checkplease/. I could at least do a written review. I've eaten at FEZ so many times, I can't count anymore. I think their burgers are some of the best I've ever had in the valley. Always juicy, I think the square patties are adorable. The FEZ burger, with it's molasses bbq, cinnamon pears, feta, providing fireworks for the tounge. Their Douxelle burger, with sauteed mushrooms, provolone cheese &  mustard, resulting in a subdued but delicious burger. Their fries, which include normal, sweet potato, harissa, & garlic are also great, but I love the salad that comes default, including their lemon dressing. If burgers & fries aren't your thing, they have Kisras( think like pizza, minus the cheese), and their daily specials are amazing. One time, I was lucky enough to score the mushroom risotto, and it was perfect.  Sugar snap peas, Drinks are fantastic too. A margarita that doesn't taste like chemicals, perfect martini's, and a G-Spot(grapefruit, pom, and vodka), make FEZ a perfect place for lunch or dinner.
other I am a huge tea drinker, so when I found out about Teavana I was excited.  I entered the store and an employee asked if I cared to try some tea. After sampling several different blends, I chose three to purchase.  The employee asked if I wanted to get a large canister for a dollar more than the one I had picked. Not realizing this store sells tea by the ounce rather than per canister, I said "sure." He chatted as he filled the containers, never mentioning the price, and once done took my debit card and rang me up. I didn't pay attention to the cost and when I looked at the receipt when I got home my heart nearly stopped. I spent $350 on tea. I returned it and they didn't give me too much trouble. Now I always check the total before handing my card over, and I won't go back. I feel like they totally swindled me.
3 Everything was average.  Fairly clean place.  Banh Xeo had to much bean sprouts.  The proportion of veg to meat was off.
other Fantastic venue! Province really adds a touch of class and elegance in a way that isn't pushy or over the top. Located in the Westin Hotel, the restaurant feels very modern! You can choose to sit inside in a beautifully decorated and spacious dining area or enjoy their fabulous patio with fireplaces and a great water feature. The food was unbelievable! I sampled their tuna and watermelon appetizer and fell in love - what an amazing combination that I'd never have thought of.If the food isn't enough, the service is superb. Every interaction with the staff was excellent - you can tell they enjoy their restaurant and are happy to be there. I cannot wait to come back to Province as soon as possible.
other Soggy overpriced fast food burger with allot of hype. When you have to cover the walls with quotes how good your product is, then you have to something to hide.
other best coffee in phoenix (so far). experienced and friendly baristas, a large sitting area inside, nice decorations, community conscious, promotes local art and artists, outdoor sitting area, easily accessible location from the light rail and from the portland park neighborhood. i had a short vanilla cappuccino and the thing that made it the best insofar to my search for phoenix's best espresso was definitely the milk. it was properly steamed microfoam. the shots were right on, too.the milk i've had elsewhere in phoenix doesn't compare. thumbs up to fair trade.
other I seriously love this store. I wish I didn't live so close because I always find myself here without even realizing it. I can always find something here that is awesome. I pretty much never leave empty-handed. They have some really great deals and prices on clothes, shoes, accesories and purses.Their high end stuff is still kind of ridiculous though. But that could just be my broke-ass opinion.
other For a chain or restaurant in general with "wing" in the name, this place really doesn't impress.If all you're looking for is standard draft beers, mediocre wings and sports, sure it'll fit that bill but it won't stand in any discernable way.Wings are just average sized. Selection of sauces is good, the hottest is pretty hot but not extremely flavorful. I suppose it's just there to burn you twice, you know what I'm talking about.I won't go on promoting a bunch of local bars or chains locally that do the same thing with wings, beer and sports. Oh okay, I will; Hazelwoods, Native New Yorker, Zipps and Tweakwoods all do some/everything better than Wild Wings.
other I signed up for Yelp just because of the poor service and being cheated out of money from Cafe Rio. I already voiced my complaint to the restaurant and to their website in writing, however I haven't received a phone call or email back.I've visited this establishment twice and each time I go I receive very little toppings on my burrito or tacos. I understand that it's made to your order like Chiptole or Qdoba, but they'll add very little cheese or toppings on your food, which can cause you to request more. To save myself time and every yelpers eyes from reading this long story, the individual making my tacos was extremely frugal on the toppings on my tacos. She barely put any cheese on my 3 tacos and I simply requested that she could put a little more on the tacos. She did and when I went to pay for my order, I was charged an extra 9other cents for "side cheese." The issue isn't the money because eating at Cafe Rio can be expensive for a fast-food mexican restauant, but it's the principle of charging me extra after I said, "can you please put a little more cheese on my taco." This hasn't been the first time this happened, but a previous visit had the same result with the sauce on my burrito. I thought mexican food restaurants had gigantic burritos and generous size tacos, but Cafe Rio will charge you on top of your order if you don't like their skinny tacos.All I ask for from Cafe Rio to acknowledge that when you add more toppings to what the cook's add to your food, that they say, "this will be extra." They do this at Chiptole and Qdoba, but Cafe Rio would rather screw you over at the end. I will not be visiting this establishment again. As I said, it's the principle as to why they charged me extra for this, not the money.
other Tried them out for Restaurant Week.  The food and service was excellent.  I will certainly be back and loved the atmosphere. We sat at a booth and very comfortably sat 3 adults.  The wait staff was non stop on refilling drinks, bringing more bread, making sure the food was cooked to order.
other Perhaps you've heard of the Library of Congress.  Nice Library.Burton Barr Central Library has a bigger reading room.Wil Bruder was the Architect.  You either love his work, or you hate his work.  I love his work!  And, this library is as good as it gets.Arrive in the sixth floor reading room a little before Noon *on* the Summer Solstice.  Ask a librarian:  They'll tell you why. [ah, the mystery....]
other Go here if you live in AZ.  It fills the void in my life being a native Oregonian missing Deschutes Brewery.  I must admit though, I've only been here once because its a difficult place to dine with a 1other month old child.  Might want to get a babysitter for this one.
other I like Rubio's in general, but this location is pretty hit or miss on the food quality and service.  I prefer the one on the other side of the I-10 next to the movie theater.
other 2.5, just not enough to give it three. Food was just OK and they ran out of ahi tuna by 9pm! They have happy hour all night (pretty good specials too) but they close SO early (10pm last call on Sunday)!
other I'm glad I bought my tickets back in August when the event was first posted.  I'm not sure the organizers knew what an amazing turn out they would have but the event was sold out so tickets were not available at the door.  We arrived at 11:1other (doors opened at 11) and while standing in line to get in there was a staff person checking to make sure we all had tickets and letting people know that if they did not, the event was sold out. Once inside it was a sea of cupcakes!  Tiny cupcakes that were delicious!  I didn't taste one that I didn't like.  Liberty Market was my fave I think.  Espresso Carmel and Red Velvet!  YUM!!!  Cruelty Free Cakes makes delicious vegan cupcakes too!  I also liked the ones from Cry Baby Ranch. I'm going to have to find them again at the 20th street Farmers Market and Old Town Scottsdale Farmers Market.  And everyone was so nice!  $10 got you all the cupcakes you could eat and water AND milk!!  And it was for two very worthy causes.  Singleton Moms and Safe Haven For Animals.  There were also raffles, a cupcake eating contest and cupcake decorating for the kids.  So many festivals these days charge you to get in and then, once inside, charge for everything else.  People can't afford that these days so it was refreshing to go to an event and not be nickel and dimed for everything.  I appreciate that.  And best of all my daughter had a great time!  There were lots of people so it was a little overwhelming for her but she loved it.  Both of us are just coming down from our sugar high.  It was great to see Gabi and Lindsey manning the Yelp booth and our very own Thomas S. helping with emcee duties!  Will I be back next year?  You bet!!  And you should come too....just make sure you get your tickets early!
other I'm fairly new to the whole Costco experience. Now that we've bought a house it's time to buckle down and buy in bulk! As as new user I'd thought it would be helpful to post the following neat services Costco has to offer:1. Great deals on contact lenses. Before I would buy my contacts from justlenses.com but through Costco I bought 8 boxes (a year's supply) and received $50 off! $2other off via instant rebate at the cashier and another $2other off via mail-in rebate which came in less than a month after the order.2. PIZZA AND HOT DOGS. The take out pizza is huge and only 9.99 and the hot dog and coke pair is only 1.50. These make for a delicious and quick lunch. They also have smoothies and salads if you're looking for something on the "lighter" side.3. Food expos come and go often. Recently I got a deal on a 10 pack of pita bread, a huge container of hummus and pita chips for 1other bucks. The company was from California and let customers try as many samples as they pleased.  It was well worth the money and super fresh!4. And here's where I feel Costco has really benefited me. My fiance and I booked our honeymoon to Tahiti through Costo Travel! I'm big on comparing prices before making a big purchase and Costco was hands down the best price. It included seven nights, hotel and round-trip airfare all for one great deal. The customer service agent I spoke with was friendly and more than willing to answer my 500 questions about travel. I would recommend Costco Travel to anybody looking for reliable customer service and excellent travel/airfare packages.
other So there name on Yelp is a bit behind the times as they are now Monte Vista $2.2other Cleaners..  Still, at $2.25, I find them to be the best place in the area.  You can't beat the price, and no matter what I drop off, shirts or pants to be laundered or dry cleaned, I always know it will be $2.25.  I hate places where some shirts are $1.50 and some are $other but you don't know until you get the bill.Same day service is available for dry cleaning which comes in handy if you are like me and wait until you are out of clothes before you drop things off..
other Well.. i love the space. It feels like a fresher, newer LUX.  EVerythings "newer"..that's the only real difference (oh..and it;s 3 blocks over). Same varied array of mid-century modern tables and chairs.  Original artwork spread thru-out.   I've heard it the same original owners of LUX so it makes sense.    Even the espresso tastes like LUX.. which i don;t care for really.. tastes burnt.  I love my espresso... but not here nor there.i love the space, its convenient, evreyone was friendly but (BIG BUT).. they close at 7pm Here's why i find it a problem... .Near a big High Rise, off the light rail (central and c-back).. so I would assume the majority of the crowd would prefer showing up, having a copa de cafe', enjoy some wi-fi surfing, mingle with friends.. but... how can I if i get off work at 5... i;m home by 5:30... freshen up at home.. it';s now 6.... i walk to  Lola... its now 6:15... I order my coffee... it;s ready.. i sit down.. it;s 6:30, I now have 30 minutes to enjoy my espresso read the paper or check my email.  but hey,,, that;s just me.  why do I give it other stars u may ask... again.. i love the space, the people, the art.. the furniture.. and most importantly I love small local business.PLEASE STAY OPEN LATER! (and reconsider your espresso bean)
other Great place to have sushi and there other great menu items.   I go here at least once a month.   A litte pricey but the qualify and preparation of the food more than offsets the price.    Great place to meet friends and enjoy the atmosphere.    The waite staff is very good.      Highly recommend you try RA.     I believe you will enjoy the experience.
other other stars for the place itself and it's food/coffee.0 stars for the service, or lack there of.  My business partner and I were in town for a convention.  We heard we should check out Lola.  So we did.  We were excited.  The lady (I use the term loosely here) who took our order was LESS than patient OR helpful.  We asked a few questions.  She barely answered us, then when we had to repeat the question she was nothing short of annoyed.  An example.  We asked where we could get a glass or cup of water.  She mumbled something about the bar/table.  My partner walked over and saw no cups.  She came back and asked where the cups were.  On the table came an exasperated retort.  I walked over to inspect for myself.  There were no cups on the table.  So I kindly asked her if the cups should be on the table, if so there appeared to be none.  She said they are on the table, but *sigh* I'll go check, but I know they're there!  10 seconds later she comes out of the kitchen with a tube of cups.  IMAGINE THAT the customer was right.  I watched this lady serve other customers.  It appears that regulars are treated with a smile and courtesy and patience.  Newcomers or people she doesn't like are treated worse than the dirt on the bottom of her shoes.My suggestion to management, adjust her attitude or get rid of her!  She is not good for business.
other Dr. Ellis is compasionate, caring, and really demonstrates his passion for what he does. The entire staff made us feel comfortable from the moment we walked in to the time we left the office. They went the extra step to make sure my other year old was having fun at the dentist! I would recommend this office to anyone who has children. Dr. Ellis and his team are the best!
other First time here and it was really good. I ordered the bobbie sandwich since I hear everyone raving about it. It was ok. Not my favorite. Place is really clean and wasn't busy at all for lunch around 1130. I like going to a place where I can get in and get out. Staff was really friendly. They gave me this punch card.. buy 10 get the 11th free. Very nice. About the same prices as subway so I wasn't upset. Plus the sizes of food are definitely moneys worth. At least I think. For anyone in the Chandler area, this is definitely a place to stop in and try.
other This is one of my favorites stores to head to when I need the motivation that comes from new triathlon clothing and accessories. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful, without being intimidating.  They have a decent selection of women's items that are high quality and come with a high price - so I normally head there when I'm looking for race wear/accessories and go elsewhere for regular workout clothes.   They do have some sale items, and recently I found some great Pearl Izumi tri shorts for half off - woo hoo!It's great to have stores like this geared towards triathlons!
3 Great food, bad service. Does anyone speak english in here?
other Great place to go before heading to the zoo. Not a lot of seating if you're with a big party
other Sorry, I am gonna get killed here... I am not that impressed.I kept hearing about this place and it was so so at best. The food is sloppy and very expensive but has a decent tasteThe place was also a little dirty looking..Just a bunch of sandwiches and the pizza was a disaster, go there if you are into quirky places that charge a lot and are not the best.The waitress seemed pre-occupied by what?? not us.
other just wanted to chime in & say that this place is so vegetarian-UN-friendly it's not even funny. I was dragged here with family & ended up ordering a chile relleno, which was just about the only meatless item on the menu, short of a fucking cheese crisp.it wasn't terrible, but this place is really just all kinds of lame. service was mediocre, food was mediocre. with as many awesome & authentic mexican restaurants as there are in the valley, there's no reason on earth to come back, except MAYBE to try a mango margarita.
other First time at St. Francis last night. Good menu selection, had an excellent server, good portion size and excellent meal.  I tried the chicken salad for dinner and it was tasty and just then right size.  They have provided a nice atmosphere with exposed brick, stainless steel tables, and just the right amount of lighting and music.  Only downside was the backless seats at our booth. Very trendy, but somewhat uncomfortable. Ask for a table instead and you'll be fine. I'll return.
other I am not a connoisseur of cupcakes so I don't have a ton of references to use on this review. That being said, I'm not really a big fan of cupcakes either. This place is family owned and operated. There's a wife and husband who run the place and the wife's sister works there also, which I thought was great. It is in the strip mall towards the western end of the shopping center.I tried a variety of the flavors including the Reese With-a-spoon, and a chocolate, chocolate chip cupcake. Coworkers that I shared them with, who are cupcake aficionados, really enjoyed the lemon and red velvet versions. While slight pricey for a cupcake, (slightly north of $other per cupcake) if you have a special occasion or just want a special treat these cupcakes are incredibly moist and delicious. They also do custom cakes and cake pops, though I can't speak to either of the latter two.
other I work right down the street from Press and have been a huge fan from my very first visit! The staff is unbelievably friendly and extremely passionate about their craft! Everything from the food to the coffee is first rate! They always accommodate my special requests (a little more of this, none of that) and always make good suggestions when I'm looking for something new. I love the yogurt and granola parfait (strawberry and vanilla yogurt for me with a bit of honey and light granola) for breakfast with a white chocolate latte. Also, the breakfast burritos are perfectly creative and filling. For lunch, my favorite is the cactus club panini with a small side salad. Also worth mentioning is that they have the VERY BEST iced coffee around. They call it an iced toddy and any one of the employees would be happy to tell you how it is different from regular coffee. I just know that it tastes amazing and seems to have a bit more of a caffeine kick!  My favorite part about Press are their delectable desserts! The berry mascarpone cake pretty much makes you feel like you've won the lottery. And the ghirardelli brownies and chocolate chip cookies (warmed up) are a weekly addiction of mine.  Starbucks is a thing of the past. I'm lucky to be in close proximity to Press, but I think I would even make the drive just for that mascarpone cake!
other I went for family birthday on a Friday night. Only a few people in dining room eating. (1st clue to leave.) Ordered a margarita. It's extra to have it shaken... But I ordered that way. It was mostly sour mix. An it was awful (How do you mess up a margarita?(2nd clue to leave) Server is surprised we wanted to order dinner! (3rd clue to run!) Very disappointing. I got the chicken fajitas, they had sauce all over them. Shrimp appetizer consists of 3 shrimp $8. Salsa was good.  I will never go back. Good luck Salty. I love your decor. Why don't you care you could be so cool!
3 The 3rd star is because they have EVERYTHING.  And you can't beat the prices.  And as far as crowded, budget conscious mega stores, this is definitely on the cleaner side, even with their current renovation project going on.The dark side...  it IS a very crowded mega store, especially at the later hours.  And as crowded as it gets from 9pm-1am, there's usually only other checkers, which makes for LONG lines.  If you can hit this place during a quieter time, earlier mornings or early evenings, then you can get what you need without breaking the bank.
3 I have to say I was pretty disappointed with our brunch experience here. Ok class, let's have a lesson. What makes a good, traditional, Eggs Benedict? Easy question, you say?Answer: Nice crispy, toasted English muffin, meat of your choosing (let's go with Canadian Bacon), creamy delicious Hollandaise.What am I missing, class?Ah yes, a beautiful poached egg, which bursts when pierced, spilling it's silky, golden yolk. Ok so now that we've had our lesson, let's put it into practice. My eggs Benedict was served with three quartered tomatoes, very very very crunchy potatoes with no seasoning and two eggs Benedict. One was completely missing a yolk! Bummer. When our server came over, I told him and he brought out a new one, but the yolk was overcooked. Bummer, times two. My friend also had an overcooked egg on his plate.For the prices they're charging, we should have had four perfectly cooked eggs and well seasoned potatoes. It's brunch, not brain surgery. The space is beautiful, and the server was pleasant, but I won't come back. Too many other places to try for brunch.
other After four years of living in AZ I finally found Mexican food that appeals to me and my husband. Lets just say they changed my husbands view on tacos. He never swayed from eating vegetarian burritos until he got a hold of their carne asada tacos. In the last other months we lived in AZ we went there almost every week and brought friends, whom now can't get enough of them too.They are reasonably priced, have great customer service and everything we have eaten so far has been fabulous. If you are looking for great food and you're not concerned with being in a fine dining Mexican restaurant, then look no further. We miss you Los Taquitos.....
3 If you want to feel really bad about what you're eating, you'll love Rally's...I tried this place for lunch, after I heard about the "Baconzilla". I love bacon, so this burger sounded like a match made in heaven for me. The burger itself was OK, though I didn't love it. It was two patties, cheese, and about 47 slices of bacon. The bacon was the saving grace, as the burger itself was a little dry and didn't have a ton of flavor. You can also have different styles of "loaded" fries, I had seasoned fries with cheese and bacon. When I think about my meal there, it's amazing that I've lived long enough to write this review...It's a quaint little place, you can either walk up and eat outside or do the drive thru, either way the food is ready pretty quick. In addition to burgers they have chicken strips and a double decker fish sandwich, so it's not all about the red meat. It's not high quality, and it's the furthest thing from good for you, but if you're in the area and you want a greasy burger, Rally's is a good place to try.
other Loving this neighborhood froyo joint.  The topping selections are interesting and slightly different thatn some other places.  They have these yummy little chocolate rocks...kinda like candy coated chocolate shaped like rocks.  They were fun and tasty.  A nice assortment of topping sauces too...peanut butter, mallow, strawberry.  This place gets jam packed but they do have a good amount of seating both inside and out.
other waitress wasn't good with service.mongolian beef dish sucks.fish is just ok.rock bottom is usually pretty good, but this one in scottsdale is not that great.
other The workers here are helpful and nice.  Especially the chubby Mexican man!  He was awesome and popped up in the veggie aisle and then bagged our groceries too.  Somehow we also got a 10% discount on our groceries (we didn't have a discount card or anything since we are out of towners).  Even though this place smells like most Chinese supermarkets, I would definitely come back if I needed something.
other I'm so happy this store is located so close to my house! Every time I come to this store I get great service. I mainly use this store to get food items for my dog or the grooming salon - where Zombi has never had a bad experience. This location also has a Banfield Vet Hospital, PetsHotel, Doggie Day Camp, Training services and at times has adoptions. My best friend has used both the PetsHotel and the Doggie Day Camp for her pooch and has never had a bad experience. I also used the Banfield Vet to get Zombi up-to-date on her Rabies and the Vet was super nice. The best part was that I didn't even have an appointment, I just walked in and they were able to fit me in after a five minute wait.My only pet peeve (pun intended) is there is usually only one cashier working and the line can get pretty long. However, it doesn't take long for another employee to open up another line to speed up the check-out experience AND they usually show up on their own, without customers complaining about only having one cashier. Bonus!
other Mostly rave reviews on Yelp led me to Le Chalet, a unique little indie restaurant amid the strip malls and Super Targets of the West Valley.Despite the fifty-some-odd write-ups, I wasn't sure what to expect. I read something about an ice cave, live comedy, hanging man meat, and surveillance cameras, but despite these oddities what drew me in was the promise of expertly crafted crepes and the opportunity to see the chefs do their stuff on a closed circuit TV.Le Chalet did not disappoint. Sit in the front dining area to view the chefs at work in the open kitchen, or take a seat in the dining area by the bar where two flat screens showcase the action at the crepe griddles. The Bretonne crepe with ham, mushrooms, Swiss cheese, and a sunny-side up egg was superb, and I can't wait to go back and try the La Landaise, blinis topped with seared fois gras, apple, and balsamic glaze.I also tried La Potence (the "hanging man"), filet medallions served on a medieval looking mace, seared tableside with bourbon and served with a pineapple slice, rice, and some mayo-based dipping sauces. Thoroughly enjoyable, but next time I would opt instead for a cheese fondue or the melted Raclette plate with cured meats, which looked delicious.The ambiance seemed a bit strange to me, but homey and comfortable. And yes, there is a sculpted ice cave for performances, The night I attended was slated for "clean comedy" and I made it a point to get out of there despite some morbid curiosity (I'm not an amateur comedy fan, and the idea of family-friendly comedy made me even more anxious).The handsome server was very attentive and knowledgeable, and I loved the half-carafe option when ordering wine. I wouldn't classify Le Chalet as a "fondue place", where the experience often outshines the food; it's more of a casual cozy spot that serves up thoughtfully prepared comfort cuisine - all the ingredients for a lovely dinner out.
3 Came for dinner with a friend with the $other off coupon. The service was attentive, friendly, and overall excellent. The english conversation is less than stellar but the fact they took off $other from both of our meals more than makes up for it. Still a little pricey for two gals with small appetites but not bad. Pani poori, naan, mango lassi, hot chai tea, tikka masala, paneer makani, lamb curry, and many other options available. I would avoid the gross spaghetti noodle option and awkward as it sounds mango flavored other fruit custard.  Overall a good experience. My favorite part is that the separators still have bears from when it was a black bear diner!
other Bomb .....................................................................................................................Heated toilet seats
other I was really disappointed with my local Baja Fresh tonight.  The lobby, salsa bar and even drink station were very dirty and unkept.  To top that off my salad had old dark colored guacamole and limp lettuce.I hope they read this and will do a better job at cleaning up!
3 In short... great view, really expensive food.
other I usually do not write reviews, but was so horrified by my experience I had to. Went for a late night bite and drink with a friend, they were fairly busy so we had a seat at the bar. As I frequent The Moon often, I was happy to see the bar was busy as well. The bartender quickly came over and was noticably intoxicated, as she could not even tell me the flavors of vodka they had. We ordered our drinks, and watched as she broke glass into the ice, knocked over glassware and broke a beer bottle. As we looked around most of the guests had the same look of horror on their face. We decided to order some food, as she spilled my drink on us (refilled it with something completely different) and she could barely even talk at this point. We saw management watch her behavior and do nothing, as she preceded to grab dirty glassware and refill it with beer. I was so appauled by this we left befpre finishing our drinks or food. I'm not sure what she was on but if its visible to paying customers it should be visible to management. Being beyond embarassed for the establishment, I would doubt I will come back, sad as we would frequent the Moon 2-3 times a week. Horrible.
other I live in north Phoenix and believe me there needs to be a lot more quality dining out here. This is a gem. The atmosphere is tops. The food is consistent. The management actually cares. It's just a cool place all the way around! A lot of corporate establishments seem to yank popular things off the menu cause it's just not trendy anymore. Every single thing I have had at this place was delicious! Not one other restaurant has pulled that off. A place you can actually count on for a good evening. High five to the Yard house!
other Best customer service you can find! I buy all of my reptiles and feeders from these guys!James the owner is awesome and very eager to answer any and all questions you have.he will even probe your snakes for free!Every animal i have bought from them has been in tip top shape!Their prices are great and the employees are awesome!I suggest them over any and all shops in the east valley including az reptile center and predators.Give em a shot you will be glad you did!
3 Anything with the word "Original" in that name always makes me wonder, for real? This place is for real. It is very close to the new house and I met the 'rents there for a burger the other night and to watch the Giants beat the '9ers. I immediately felt a sense of familiarity when I walked in the door, I hadn't remembered being there before until I walked in. But it all came back to me very quickly. I remember stopping by here years ago with friend before heading to the Fair one year. It was just as good as I remember it. It is an old fashioned burger join. You can either walk up and order then take your food to your table, or if you are on the bar side you can order from the bartender, who is very attentive, even with a full bar and restaurant. Once you get your burger or sandwich, you go to the fixin's bar, load up on toppings and veggies then sit back down to enjoy! They also have some great sides and aps, fried mushrooms, onion rings, zucchini and fries. They fries are OK, a little over done for my taste but everything else was great. This is a great place to make a regular stop on your weekly happy hour agenda, to watch a sports game (tons of TVs on the bar side) or to fix your burger cravings.
other Friendly and knowledgeable staff! They even have a nutritionist on site which shows their dedication to promote healthy living! I think it's great that they make the food daily and have appropriate portion sizes.  I gave it only other stars instead of other because they didn't have as many vegetarian/vegan meals as I would have liked. What I did purchase though tasted delicious! I look forward to going back and checking out their meals again!
other I only ask for two things when I'm flying. To land safely. And to not fear planes while on them.US Airways only delivered on one of those, and I'm still undecided on the first one.Took a flight late from PHX to SFO. Two hours isn't too bad. Unless of course it was the longest two hours of your life and you could hear people in the cabin praying for their lives.I understand that turbulence is normal. But I would rather you cancel another flight because it is too dangerous to fly, then to put passengers through the scariest flight of their lives.Oh and when you finally do land and are thanking your maker that you are in fact still alive, its probably best that you don't have to overhear the pilots saying "Wow, that was scary. I'm surprised we landed alright."Morons. They should pay for the trauma I'll have for the rest of my life.
other Conspire is independent, open late, and yummy. Everything I look for in a coffee shop. You'll be a fan if you miss Counter Culture or Willow House.The owner makes a wonderful latte. He steams the milk perfectly, better than most baristas in Phoenix! I just wish he had brewed coffee. Sure, the espresso is good, but it is not a replacement for a thoughtful, well mixed, drip. No, I do not want an americano instead. I want a cup of coffee!
other Saw this place in the Yelp email.  Needed to take my son to Toys R Us to use a gift card and it occurred to me that Habit Burger was right there, so I suggested we have lunch there rather than the usual McD's.  I temped him with the offer of a chocolate shake.I was amazed with the cleanliness and brightness of this place.  There was a line when we got there, but it moved quickly.  The tables were packed but we managed to snag a 2-top pretty soon after getting in line.  My son had the kids grilled cheese meal (something you don't find at your standard fast food place) and I had a charburger.  We shared his fries and the shake.OMG - the burger was heavenly!  The roll gets a little grill to it so it has a little crunch on the inside.  It was not greasy at all, just tasty and soooo good!  The fries were equally ungreasy and good - crunchy too.  The chocolate shake - my son only had about 3 sips which left me to drink the rest of it (dang it) - was absolutely delish.  And the prices were outstanding!Its a good thing there isn't a Habit Burger closer to my house.  I'd eat there all the time!  Five Guys?  Forget em!!!
other I love my eye doctor!  Platonically, of course.  The entire staff is relaxed, friendly, easy going, and personable.  No one ever makes you feel rushed but instead take time to make sure that everything is okay, that you've thought of everything, gotten all of your questions answered, and had plenty of time to make decisions and think.  The doctor takes time to get to know you and to talk about how you use your eyes (staring at the computer, sports, etc).  The assistants try to think of things from your point of view so they can volunteer useful information and ask a lot of specific questions while doing so.  This place treats you like family.  There's a broad range of styles, but mostly, they're fashionable frames.  When I go in, I see a lot of kids, young adults, and 20 and 30-somethings as well as the older patients who so often come to need glasses.  Horwitz costs a little more than the mall chains, but my prescriptions have been consistently better thanks to the doctor taking time, the lenses are much higher quality, and the frames are worlds better in terms of availability of things that aren't ugly and durability.
other Even though there are only two things on the menu that I can eat, they're damned tasty and the service is incredibly fast.  I am a bit surprised by all the five stars though, you people do realize that this is just a chain sandwich joint, right?
other My first ever trip to Bass was overwhelming. Like walking into a Sportsman's Warehouse that had mated with Dick's Sporting Goods, and then gone on steroids. Bass Pro Shops is an outdoor person's dream. And it's good for the whole family, oddly enough!Once you get inside this massive place, you have an upstairs and downstairs. There is a kid's area, a restaurant with fresh fish, a huge women's section and mens, and areas for fishing and boats and hunting and camping and survival and gear for any occasion. You can look at the giant fish tank, climb up a faux rock side for $3, and just be purely entertained for ages. They have snack foods and jerky and sweets. BBQ grills. Do they have guns? I don't know, probably! They have GPS equipment and water bottles and on and on and on. It was exhausting in a great way. My camping/outdoors needs tend to be more mimimalist oriented so I prefer an REI. But I like it here a lot. I picked up some socks that have a lifetime guarantee, and a nice woolen shirt for almost nothing, and a couple of gifts for the hunter/outdoors people in my life back in Tucson.Bass: it is an experience.
other I visited the Keg in Tempe on a Satuday evening to reconnect with an old buddy from high school that I have not seen in years.  Overall, the meal was good.  Service was prompt, and they had my reservation.  The Keg has gone out of their way to have hostesses who could double as the models on the Howie Mandel Deal or No Deal gameshow, so initially I figured confusion would ensue.  It didn't.  : )Beer was served cold and quickly when ordered, so no delays on the service.Their appetizer choices were mostly seafood which doesn't help me out.  We got some kind of bowl of cheese and "stuff" and a plate of chips to dip with.  It was ok, but not exceptional.  I hope they turn up the appetizer department to take care of non-seafood eaters.Anyways, the Wedge salad I got was very good.  Drenched in a bit more Blue Cheese than I would have expected even for a Wedge salad, so if you are adverse to too much dressing, you may want to get the dressing on the side.  The steak I ordered was supposedly bacon wrapped, but I could not taste it if it was.  It was a good filet though, and they did cook to my ordered temp on the first order.  Always nice to get it right the first time!The loaded potato and vegetable sides were good, served fresh and hot, again, no complaints.Water refills were well timed and the service did not rush the meal or annoy.This restaurant would only hit a 3 for me, but the manager called next evening following up on my experiences. (They had my phone number from when I made the reservation.)  I think that puts these guys in a good class since they are clearly working on the most important element of any restaurant, the customer service.  And oh yeah, the steak was good!
other Lots of "gay on gay" homophobia here.  Hick bars in Alabama are more gay friendly.  Staff and owners know this but they do not seem to care.  Oh well
other if a hipster bar met a dive bar, this would be their offspring!good music and lots of kinds of friendly people!
other $8.17 poorer after getting two dry cupcakes with hard frosting. Not sure if this is because I had refrigerated them for a short while until I finished my dinner, but I don't think frosting should make an audible, snapping sound when I sink my teeth into a cupcake. The quality of my cupcakes was comparable to baked goods purchased at regular grocery stores. Very disappointed. I wish the cupcakes reflected the charm and appeal of the storefront and its employees - the young lady behind the counter was very nice and helpful.
3 Was in the area for a grad school interview and the BF was craving some red meat. Came here based on yelp reviews, left pretty full, content about the food. Service was friendly enough, but we had some trouble communicating what we wanted. We settled on the kalbi, bulgogi and the ribeye? steak meats, with an order of the tofu soup. Everything was a-okay but I think the only thing that stood out was the ribeye. Normally we like to cook the meat ourselves but since we didnt want to stink on our plane ride back to cali, we decided to let them do it for us. Side dishes were standard with the different pickled veggies, kimchi, potato salad, etc. Waiters were pretty prompt in bringing out replacement side dishes for us.   Since we don't know the area very well, the stars are good service, being open at odd hours (I think we got there at 4pm?) clean restaurant, decent food. -other stars for small portions and no real wow factor.
other This was my first half marathon.  I enjoyed the music the buzz of tens of thousands of people all about to do a crazy long run.  It was amazing seeing the sunrise over the city.  I found the parking, shuttles at Tempe and food-court to be very easy to use.  It seemed well planned for such a large event, just not enough bathrooms for the amount of people.The PA for the full marathon kept going in and out so it introduced the other star athletes but you couldn't hear their reason for being there or accomplishments. Bathrooms on the course were way too few and huge lines.  I felt bad for those who needed them.  I saw less than 10 at the first other stops for 12000 people.  If you gotta go #other on the course, too bad,...  Take Imodium on race day I guess.Bands and support were fantastic, but this was my 1st time so can't compare.... GU gel is always on me, great to see them out there. The course is NOT flat having a 'heartbreak hill' in it at mile aprox. 9.  UPS gear check bag split apart at a feather's touch the day before the race.  Good thing, i was going to use it.  The top of the seam isn't sealed so any slight pressure/tear will open the entire side. HaABOUT THE AUTHOR-INTERESTING BACKGROUNDMy first endeavor was a rolerblade marathon in tucson in 2004.  I guess it's out of style now so no more skates.  Used to do the New TImes 10k in phoenix every year too.  GONE, sad.Last year I did the Tour de Phoenix 7other mile bike race on a 33lb. full suspension (no lockouts) mountain bike with slime in both tires and all my supplies on my bike and camelback... thought i was tough, 'till I tried running!  Injuries were now a new thing now and it is much tougher per hour than biking, but about the same calorie burn... Still love both. I did a sprint triathlon recently too.We all know running is 'hard' you don't get extra calorie burn from impact stress but something about running and especially in this event captured my interest.  On the way to the zoo last year i saw the half marathon pass by and said "I think i could do that NOW" boy was i wrong... it took me almost a year to train for this event, but what a worthwhile challenge.  I did this as a run walk 3 min run other min walk.  I learned from the Galloway training method that this method is not only easier but faster than trying to run straight through.  .I am capable of the constant run for this time but it winds up being slower than when i take walk breaks. I tested this with a 10k distance. I was 7 minutes faster with a run walk than running straight through.  look it up, may change your life too.  I took 50 other minute walk breaks and i did my time goal of aprox. 2:30 with other bathroom break.
other I'm from the East coast, so living in Arizona feels like living in the land that Chinese food forgot. George and Son's offers the closest thing to "Chinese" food that I have found in Arizona (yes I know this isn't real Chinese cuisine, just look at my picture). PF Changs is not Chinese food, and that is the best I have eaten before I came here. All the other Chinese food that I have found is full of MSG, and makes me sick.The restaurant is cozy and relaxing, and the staff is very attentive. The sesame chicken is very good. I recommend asking for firecracker chicken. It is not on the menu, just ask for the firecracker pork, but with chicken. It has the right kick to it. I would NOT recommend the orange peal chicken. After eating 1/other of my plate, I wan't to swear off anything orange for a month. I guess I needed something less sweet with a more varying taste. Last time I went in, I had the three amigos, which was very good. This is shrimp, chicken, and beef in a brown sauce, poured over a hot skillet plate at your table. I would recommend any of the three I mentioned.
other I can always count on Sacks.   It is always fresh and always tasty and the sandwiches are so creative that years later I'm still not sure how they get those fabulous blends and tastes that they do.   I try to hit lunch a little off the lunch hour and then the crowds are not so bad and I can find parking but, its worth it to eat a little latter when I know the meal will be so satisfying I can go back to work and be so productive.   Sacks is my "go to place" when I have a guest or friend that I want to be well fed and satisfied too.
other Great place for hippies, do-gooders and at this location an inordinate amount of old folks. I love the deli here. always a great sandwich at a good price. Although I don't see myself buying anything "soy" or "organic" or hippie friendly here I do like to shop here from time to time.
3 I was here for a business dinner recently and loved their new hummus plate.  They put grilled zucchini on it and had some fresh jicama which was awesome.  I wasn't in the mood for BBQ at the time but so I ordered a turkey burger which came on a whole wheat bun and some steamed broccoli.  I love the healthy options.  Thanks to Red Robin for helping to fight the battle of the bulge.  Just make sure you bring lots of will power when come here because it's easy to blow it...especially with the desert menu!!
other Most livable city my eye!Plastic yuppies around every corner looking for a reason to belong.  I can't wait for the homosexuals to take control of this dog park and give it some class.Avoid at all cost.
other Best happy hour on this side of town. The bartenders are very friendly and service is always prompt. I've never had a bad drink or a bad meal here. I only go in if Jennifer is working though! The bar has plenty of TVs too.
other BEST FRY'S YETFeelin' a little blue, need a doc? No big deal, stop on by...Forgot to cash in your last paycheck? Pshh, Bank of America ATM AND bank up in this jointCrammin' for the next exam? Get your coffee fix on your way outFood, deli, bakery, flowers, home furnishings, school supplies, I don't know where it ends...All I need is a bed and I could live here...Oh wait, they sell them here too.And all this time I thought they just fixed computers and sold TVs
3 Ok, this is coming from sombody that is not a fan of the Cheesecake factory.My cousin, her friend, and I walk into the the restaurant and decided to eat in the bar area.  We had a very sweet waitperson, Summer.  She rocked with suggestions and her personality was great.  I had one of their smoothies, just like the one at Cheesecake Factory.  It was good, but I have had better at Jumba Juice.  I ended up having their angel hair pasta, my cousin had a chicken salad, and friend #3 decided that he would just mooch off our plates.  The reason why I hate these types of places is that they give you WAY TOO MUCH FOOD!  Why do they do that?  Especially with people, like me, that learned that they better clean off their whole plate? I just gained 10 pounds.Food was nothing spectacular.  My cousin then ordered the Splenda Cheesecake, that she said tastes horrible. (She had the one at Cheesecake Factory, which she thinks is awesome)other stars to the lovely Summer (or was it Winter...I can't remember now...crap!)  My cousin actually left her money on the booth.  She called the restaurant and Summer actually said she found it and was holding it for her just in case she came back for it.  Extra plus for honesty that I didn't even think existed in the world anymore.  other stars for the mediocre food.  And 3 stars to the host stand...a story that I don't have enough energy to even type here.
other Pastrami tasted good, but had a lot of tough tissue, and was near impossible to bite through. Rye bread was low-quality.Curly fries were tasty.Cole slaw was yummy! Really the highlight of the meal.Lemon bar was delicious, if a bit subdued. (I like the lemon to pucker my face)The brownie was warm and chocolatey, but too many nuts.Probably my only visit, unless someone invites me.
other This place is sweet, I highly recommend it.  When you walk in the door be sure to look down at the floor because you're standing on a fish tank - pretty cool.  The decor is very trendy and the atmosphere is chill.  We had a drink at the bar on a Weds. night before heading out to the patio for dinner - not overly crowded which was nice.  The sushi was delicious - quality pieces and very fresh.  My only complaint was the bathroom sink - while very cool looking, the faucets don't work unless you slam the handle in and then the water just sprays out sporadically.  This was a little messy but the rest of the experience was great.
other You know when you get a really good cut and color.. When the stylist is done and you look in the mirror and say "Wow, you did a great job. It looks awesome".Well that was my experience yesterday. I was a bit hesitant to go to the training academy, but in these rough economic times every penny counts and their prices are fantabulous.  It is really hard to find someone that does a great job on your hair the first time you see them. My stylist was Sara Groves and I am now a customer for life. I have the feeling she is going to have a very lucrative career doing hair, too bad her prices will triple in a few months. She sat me down and asked me all about my hair, my style, the products I use ect. The best part of the entire experience was that she really listened to me and cut my hair exactly how I asked. I wanted peek-a-boo highlights in my bangs, and even though she thought it was an odd choice (and asked me if I was sure a few times ;) she gave them to me. I was extremely pleased with both my cut and color. When the receptionist rang me up I almost couldn't believe the price.. Cut and color for under $50.. WOW!
other I'm so not a 'pub & grub' kinda gal, but since this place saved me other times during a Science Center visit = pretty ok.  You can walk across from AZ Science and make this kid friendly pit stop in the middle of the day - i really am not familiar with anything else that 'now it's the parents turn' sorta thing close by.Fun pool table in other of the rooms.  Really good steak fries, fish and chips are good, and so is the french onion soup.  Since i am a wine drinker, this is not the place for wines by the glass, obviously it is a beer place, and me not being a beer drinker, not my cup of tea - ah~hem, pint that is....sooo, all-n-all a fun thing to do after sacrificing for the kids!
3 I tried Rare Earth for the first time as a solo diner.  Often a good way to get the take on a new restaurant.  I sat at the bar which has surprisingly uncomfortable seating.  Really hard seats that cut me in the back of the knees.  The wine selection is nice.  Not big but two or three choices of each variety.I ordered a glass of wine,  a small House salad and a pizza.  The server behing the bar was "professionally friendly"  Then the wait began.  Fifteen minutes passed and I still had no salad.  I was able to get the servers attention and asked about my salad. She didn't check on the status of the salad but gave the excuse that several people had come in around the same time that I did.Just about 3 minutes later both my salad and my pizza came out at the same time.  Very disappointing.  I wanted to eat my salad but I didn't want my pizza to go cold.  Note: This is extremely thin pizza...like a cracker crust...so it goes cold very quickly.The server offered to send the pizza back to keep it hot but since it had fresh tomato on it, I didn't want the pizza to be ruined.The house salad was fresh, good mushrooms and shaved pecorino cheese.  There were lots of red onions and the dressing, a house vinaigrette was very strong "and vinegary". For me the onion and vinegar were just overwhelming and I would not order that particular salad again.The pizza had a good amount of toppings and held together pretty well, even considering how thin the crust is. I would like to try this restaurant again because there were several things on the menu that sounded really good.other stars for the pizza, other stars for the salad that I ordered and 3 stars for the service.
other Forget the yogurt and the berry berry bad service. The OCD worker with shadow you and serve you a sample with a glaring stare. You'll never feel so ackward adding your toppings since she'll trail behind you and fix the spoons. Yogurt sucks as much as the service, so I don't recommend.
other What an amazing place!!  I had an incredibly enjoyable time staying at the Royal Palms Resort, and recommend it highly.  So many excellent points:  absolutely gorgeous accommodations, polite and helpful staff, excellent restaurant (breakfast/ brunch outside, with a delicious cup of coffee, is a must), a great spa, and a relaxing atmosphere.  My boyfriend and I stayed here for a conference in late October, which is a great season in Arizona.  Our stay was a pleasure from beginning to end.  The resort is well-suited for special occasions (there was a wedding reception and an outdoor conference dinner during our stay).  Our room was very comfortable, with excellent set-up and a great view of the mountains from the balcony.  The resort includes a pool, a small gym, several lounge areas with firepits and fireplaces, and the wonderful Alvadora spa (with massages, facials, outdoor-facing showers, and shaded lounge areas to your heart's content).  There are several mountain trails a short walk/ drive away from the resort, and downtown Scottsdale is 10-1other minutes away by car.  In all, a beautiful place for a special occasion!
other Very good food.  Our service was great--thank you, Heather.  She guided us to some good wines and food recommendations.  We'll be back
other This is a great place to take your time and enjoy someones company.The food is fresh and the service always friendly.If you are looking to be fed fast this is not the place to go.Fondue is fun!If you have the time and the money this is a place to have a great evening.
other I was referred to Jones Family Dentistry for an emergency procedure. I cannot express how incredible the staff and doctors were. I appreciate all the time and help they gave me. The follow up phone call really showed how caring they are. AMAZING Dentists!!! My family has a new dentist. Thank you!!!
other Living in this area I frequent Desert Ridge a lot, and have been to this Macaroni Grill several times... their food is actually pretty good which is why I let the horrible service slide a few times... My friend and I have had experiences such as standing at the host stand with no assistance for several minutes while several employees made eye contact. Of course, no one asked if we had been helped, until the hostess finally made her way back up to the stand and decided to ignore us for another couple of seconds before she even acknowledged us. Another visit we were seated right away however it took over 1other minutes for our server to come to our table, and that was only after I had to get out of my seat and find one of the employees to ask for our server. I know several people saw us just sitting there, the least they could have done was asked if we had been helped or not. This last experience, was about a year after the last. I thought maybe they would have changed. I most definitely thought wrong! We were seated promptly and the server was there right away this time. However, our food took FOREVER! Literally, it took over 30 minutes for a medium rare steak and a plate of pasta. I know for a fact they messed something up and ended up taking food out of a to go container and placing it on the plate that they then brought to me (you can see right into their kitchen from the dining room). The server never apologized nor did she come and tell us what the hold up was. Overall, I will never go to that restaurant again.
other I came here by myself because non of my fellow conference peeps wanted to walk 10 minutes to dinner.  I'm glad I made that short walk to here because I enjoyed eating their prime rib.  It was cooked just right and it was rested correctly.  Needless to say, I was so stuffed that my 10 minute walk became a 1other walk back to the hotel.
other Normally, love this store & have been a member for decades, but was very disappointed with the woman who "helped" us last Saturday in Women's Clothes. She has horrible customer service skills. Told us that, since there weren't any listed on the website, ALL REI's were sold out of a parka I'd tried on other days prior at their store. You mean to tell me that your location sold 10 North Face women's parkas in 48 hours when it's 80 degrees outside??? This was after she's told us they'd just shipped all their winter stuff to Denver the previous day. Never offered to call the other store & ask them to hold a jacket for me. Instead, she claimed all REI's were sold out of the black jackets b/c the website only showed blue & squid red. I explained that the website hadn't shown black inventory on the same day I'd tried on the coat at their store (according to her, it should have shown up on the website inventory) She still claimed all stores were sold out. Never mind, I bought it online from one of your competitors and it was cheaper too.
other On a early Saturday evening, the band was playing the crowd was just starting to meander in.  Going further inside in an attempt to avoid the high volume of the band whose audio was piped in throughout the restaurant (I failed) I realized shortly that I must of been missed siting in the middle of the dinning are as the wait staff moved smartly from the kitchen to the front delivering the drinks and food to the patrons. I ask a member of the staff was I sitting in the wrong area and soon service was rendered.  Food, nothing special but it is more of a bar than a restaurant.  Although the atmosphere was unique, I do have a question why cameras were in the mens room.
3 Good vibe - and outstanding location - they definitely work well with a large group (10), delivering orders to the right person without asking "who gets ..."  LOVE THAT KIND OF SERVICE.  And not once, NOT ONCE, did the service people call any of our group "guys" (okay, okay, a pet peeve of mine).  Horseradish potatoes are a bit salty -- and prime rib serving is definitely less than generous.  That said -- the fish and chips were great, as were (according to one of our party) the pork and beans.  Desserts are HUGE -- share with other or 3 others.

other I loved this little slice of heaven.  Reasonable prices, tiny dining room, very personal service.  Pablo was laid back, but with only other couples in the small establishment, he did a great job of making sure we were taken care of.
other Okay, if you're looking for a genuine Chicago Vienna Beef Red Hot or a NY Sabrett street cart dog; then you might not  understand Hot Dog Stop. HDS does sever Sabrett's but this is more of a gourmet hot dog place. The portions are very generous to say the least and very tasty. The folks who run the place are from France and have put their own spin on things. So if you're fixed on what a hot dog should be, then go to Luke's, or Al's or even A & W; but if you want 'something completely different, to borrow a phrase, then by all means try HDS.   Enjoy!
other This is the best restaurant in Phoenix. My wife and I have been eating out here for years, Their servers are great and the food is always delicious. The entire menu is very good and the specials are always unique.Check out their website at http://www.phoenixcitygrille.com
3 Probably the most overrated place in the Phoenix area. There pizza tastes way too much like their canned tomato sauce and there is always a wait to be seated. That being said there food overall is OK. There meat salad and cal-zones are good and the servers are friendly. For all the people out there giving it more than 3 stars: try other pizza places like spinatos, la grande Orange, pizzeria Bianca.
other Luci's is a great little neighborhood store nestled on the corner of 16th St and Bethany Home. They offer a full breakfast/lunch menu (order @ counter, then delivered to table), plus a unique variety of items that you would find in a boutique-esque grocery store. I've only eaten here once, but I have stopped numerous times for their coffee or a six pack of cold ones. The strawberry waffles were very enjoyable, and the Mrs said the hash browns (mixed with sweet potato hash browns..mmmh!) and the yogurt parfait were also very good. They have garage style glass doors that are raised during non summer months that allow for a great breeze and view of this busy little intersection.The parking is a bit of a disappointment but I guess you cant win them all. After breakfast or lunch swing by Dick's next door for a drink or wander over to Poor Little Rich Girl for some boutique shopping, great neighborhood spots, wish there were more of them.
other Great place for tapas! I really enjoy this restaurant for a couple reasons. other being that they change the menu constantly and other being that each item on the menu is always good. Some are better than others, but the worst thing on their menu is good.I love going with other or 3 other people so we can order a variety of things and I can try new and different kinds of food. Sol Y Sombra is always a nice change of pace from other Scottsdale eateries. Nice cocktail and wine list also.
3 I have never been here before so I didn't know what to expect.  Every time I heard the name "Duck & Decanter"  I would picture a nice sit-down joint with waiters and pictures of hunting stuff on hunter green walls.  This is certainly not the case I realized upon entering.  It is just a sandwich place that also sells a bunch of random bric-a-brac.  It is all basically picnic stuff I think.  I dunno...it was real difficult to get a feel for the place.  It was all pretty random to me.  But anyway, about the food....I ordered "The Duckling" sandwich was is one of their "signature sandwiches".  It seemed like a good selection because the name of the sandwich and the sandwich itself had duck in it and so does the name of the restaurant.  However, the sandwich was just ok.  Nothing special.  Not worth 9 bucks.  just a few slices of meat in between other pieces of bread.All the sandwiches on the menu did however look interesting.  They are definitely not your typical "sandwich place" type sandwiches.  Well some of them are but they all have that special Duck & Decanter twist.  The have some deli type sandwich selections as well but I would prefer to just go to a deli for those.My wife ordered the chicken salad and it was very very good.  I would order it if I ever visit the place again.  She ordered the Sonoran with spicy oil & vinegar.  It was very tasty and no mayo or any of the bad stuff.The service was very friendly but I took a long while to get our sandwiches.  There must have been a large order ahead of us or something because there weren't many people in the place.  I couldn't imagine going here on a weekday during the  lunch rush because the line would likely be out the door and would take forever to get your food.  Luckily for me I went on a hot Sunday afternoon.
other I haven't been here in quite a while, but when I was coming here, they had a jazz band doing rock and alternative covers (their name is The Latest, though I don't think they play here anymore). The place is totally trendy, but I really see that as a good thing here.
other So I have been to the location in Tucson and now experienced this one and I have to say that I did not have a WOW or YUMMM drooling moment at either. Don't get me wrong it's not horrible it just has no wow factor at all to me and I will pass next time.There is just better Mexican cuisine out there,,,Service was promt though!
other I came here on the opening night when someone from Gin Blossoms played on a makeshift stage, the beers were 2other cents and there was no food (but you know me, we ordered a pizza from a neighborhood pizza place.) Since then, they have added a full kitchen and the food is amazing (chicken strips that were designed for diners who appreciate tempura-like batter and are over the age of four), the beer is astounding (one word: Kolsch...makes me swoon) and the people are great. It's worth the walk wherever you end up finding a space to park--even better, ride your bike over like we do! The Sunday brunch is great. All of my friends sit and wish they had a student loan that would enable them to spend at least half of the day drinking here daily. I don't blame them.
3 My biggest tip for newbies to YC's, look toward the grill and look up.  There you will find a nice little menu of sauce formulas.  Unfortunately, I never looked up.  As a result, I didn't have enough sauce.  In my case, that was a good thing because the sauce I did have tasted like crap, so more of the same would have been even crappier.As for the ingredients, lots of choices with fresh veggies.  I have to say the meat looked unappetizing to me.  In fact, I had to ask my husband what the hell it was.  I guess it's a good thing you don't see piles of freshly sliced meat, else it might not be so fresh after all.  But in its frozen to minus 500 degrees F state, I found I opted for more veggies.Two sizes available.  I went with the large, crammed my bowl full until it resembled a small mountain, and then wasted over half of it.  So get the small unless you want leftovers or you haven't eaten in several days.
other love love love it! What a quaint little piece of heaven. Located south phoenix...I wasn't sure what this place would look like as we kept driving south but as we walked onto the property it felt as if you were no longer in the big overcrowded city. We went to the morning glory cafe for breakfast. The food was wonderful and the presentation was great! I highly recommend it. It would make a wonderful place for a baby or wedding shower!!
other This place pushes out some delicious food, Red chile burro with rice and beans is better than any I've had, and their Nachos are soooo freaking cheesey and good you'll want to order both for one sitting. Unfortunately only outside seating but cool art work on the building to enjoy while eating and don't be discouraged by there greedy practice of charging for extra hot sauce. But of all things to remember make sure you bring cash the place can't afford a card processing machine which is a good thing other wise I'd be there too often and a fat face looks weird on me
other So the other day, I was in the mood for sushi at my usual spot (Sakana).  Unfortunately, they were closed for lunch, so the next choice was some pasta at Caffe Boa next door.  Also closed for lunch.  Double Shit!!  Pasta Pomodoro?  Their tortellini alfredo rocks!!  Then I find out all of their AZ locations closed.  Triple shit!!  Stomach is growling and quickly getting pissed off.  Okay, Haji Baba then.  Bessie gets me there in record time but alas, the place was PACKED, even for a 2pm lunch.  What to do?  Wait...there's that little Vietnamese joint a few doors down, that I've always wanted to check out but just never did.Well, I guess they say better late than never for a reason.  I popped in, grabbed a seat and was quickly served up one of my favorite Vietnamese dishes.  Deelish is all I can say.  Now I've got a new little spot to add to my local list of favorites.
other I was very impressed by their website and their services, and setting up my files for my cards was super easy and straightforward. I ordered samples before my cards...three weeks ago.Haven't received anything yet. Now I know that the turnaround time on cards is between 12-1other days, but I didn't receive any confirmation that they'd been shipped, or what method they were being shipped through. Luckily I was able to call them and talk to people who straightened everything out, but I really get a strong feeling that they're a very small company that's still trying to learn the ropes.The biggest problem I had was that my shipping and billing addresses are different. There's a box where you type in your shipping address, then it takes you to the billing section. When I got my order confirmation, I noticed that my billing address and shipping address were listed as the same at the top of the order, then lower down in the order section was where I had typed in my correct shipping address, yet it was partially cut off. I called them about it and they assured me that it was shipping to the correct address, however once I called UPS and had them reassure me that my cards were coming to the correct address, I received another email from Taste saying that the reason my samples weren't delivered was because I didn't give them the correct address. I looked back at my confirmation receipt and the correct address was typed into the bottom of my order. It was a matter of not paying attention I guess.Suggestions would be to either pay closer attention to their customers entire order, or to work on the billing/shipping page instead of leaving it as a box to type words in, especially if it's not going to be read.Pros are that they get back to you very quickly and make sure that your custom order is correct for print.Cons seem to be the shipping and customer care portion.Will I order from them again? Possibly. But my trust has definitely been tested.
other I am not really a fan of CPK but I went here with a colleague as it was close by where we were working. I figured I would just go with a basic pizza (thin crust) and was less than impressed. For thin crust it was pretty soggy and for me that is a deal breaker. Service was good and friendly but the pizza sub-par IMO. Maybe the other items are better, but I thought I was safe going with a plain pie.
other Have the owners from here ever even had a bagel from back east? Certainly doesn't taste like it, and they charge double what they do back east too. No thanks. The search for a good bagel continues, for now I'll just keep having them shipped straight from NJ.
3 Priceline had this resort as other star but it looks and  feels like 3.The employees are nice, though. WiFi 13$/24hrs.Grounds are nice.
3 I personally love the other crackers so much more. I think it's the better customer service I'm never really impressed with the services here. It's either okay or a little below expectation something always happens when I come here. Something is forgotten or the wait is ridiculous just for the check to be picked up to be paid for or something. I can never tell you because it always changes.  Food wise...good. this last visit the French toast was NOT as amazing as it usually is. So kind of bummed about that. And my skillet I must have ordered the wrong thing because I usually just get the skillet with carnitas eggs and potatoes this time their was chorizo in it so it made my potatoes soggy:(  those things are another reason for dropped stars and also because I dont care for Chorizo and all its oils. For food and service to be off is unusual. But it happened so i always remember if you want the best you have to go to the best and this place is not it. Go to the one in mesa behind Home depot and beside Holiday Inn!
other D-scust-ing.
other This is a very special medical practice with customer service and attention to detail that you hardly ever see in a doctor's office anymore. I started seeing Dr. Ross for Osteopathic Manipulation after having a few back surgeries. He has given me tremendous relief and I highly recommend OMT rather than chiropractic treatment since it works with the tissue and muscles as well as the bones. Anyways, He listens and takes time to treat your WHOLE body unlike most doctors that have one hand on the door knob as they speak to you. I saw a Naturopath in the past and saw Cheryl the P.A. for the first time the other day. She took a lot of time with me, going through my blood work line by line. I was so please that she suggested supplements and knew about things that I learned from the Naturopath...but actually, she knew about more supplements than the Naturopath! So I was really pleased. This is a great office and everyone is like family....they also treat you like you are a part of their family. They make your children feel comfortable too. There are tons of Mickey Mouse figures and videos for them to watch. The nurses have always loved on my daughter since she was a baby. They make sure that all of us have a productive appointment! I highly recommend this office.
other I tired they chicken smash burger.... WOOHOO!!!  LOVE IT!  Crispy chicken (not too think, not too thick) but perfectly crispy.  I ordered the build your own:  Egg bun, crispy chicken, mayo, and swiss cheese.  HELLO MAMA!  The smash fries were good.  The staff is always friendly.
other My g/f love sushi! She made me a connosiuer of it. and I have to be critical. So many college kids "love" RA, but it's mediocre at best.I'll just list a few things that irk me:I went during a happy hour with co-workers. It was PACKED. Good thing, right? WRONG!Extremely poor service. when I went in to meet coworkers who already had a table the hostess told me I have to wait. When I said I have a table, she got in my face. I was tired, long-day and I wanted to chill. I walked past her, found my friends, and she left me alone.The waitress took quite a bit of time to get around to my table, and the sushi servings were OBVIOUSLY LOW!I went to Zen 32, and now my choice is SakeBomber. their happy hour servings are much more than RA, and their prices are BETTER!Be ready for loud noises, as every one is trying to talk louder than the music, and the person next to them.Just an overall poor experience. and I tip on service. Food quality was so-so. Just don't go during a happy hour, which is the only time it's worth it because it's priced so high.
other This is the second time I've eaten here and it was as good if not better than the first. The first time I had the meat lasagna and the second time I had the cheesesteak. Lemme tell you this is one of the best Italian places I've been to in Phx.It's very Back East feel to it and I love all of the authentic Italian foods they have there, especially the meat, cheese and pasta counters.Check 'em out you won't be disappointed!
other My mother located this resturant and wanted to go. I of course, looked at the reviews on yelp and was expecting a lukewarm time wih flavorless food.  I went to pepin last night and was pleasantly surprised to find the opposite.  There were 3 adults and other child in our party. My other 1/other yo decided to get cranky the moment we sat down.  The place was about 1/other full.  Our waitress came right over to our table and started to take drink orders.  My mother didn't like the location of the table so they promptly moved us to a table of her satisfaction. The waitress saw my child was squirmy and offered to get her food out right away which she did.  I had the red sangria. It was good but I've had better. My mother had the tiramisu drink that was so strong it knocked her sandles off but it was good. I had the paella which was good and tasty. My mom had lamb which she enjoyed.  I forgot what the 3rd party had but he enjoyed his. My baby had chicken fingers and fries which were actually sliced potato and she ate most of it. The entertainment was great! I kept laughing to myself about the other reviewer who said they were intent on driving nails through the floor. Yes they were stomping up a storm but it was great. My baby was so entertained and yelling and clapping. Everyone was entertained by her too. Our bill came to $123 which is not bad for food and entertainment. Oh it was saturday night about 6:15pm
other I soooo wanted to love this place after reading the great reviews.  I must admit the decor is far better than the typical nail joint; I too don't understand the point of pictures of really long red nails holding $100 bills...super cheesy.  This place does not disappoint with decor; it is like visiting a spa as opposed to a nail salon.  Also, I live nearby so this location is really terrific for me.  Unfortunately, I have been twice now...really, really wanted to make it work...and it just doesn't.  The first time, I paid extra for all kinds of services like a hot stone massage for my feet and extra callous remover,etc.  I left spending $90. No big deal if the product is good.  However, I had to go home and clean up the polish left gooped around my cuticles, file the hard edges of my nails down to something that wouldn't injure my husband, and the massage was like being tickled and then rubbed with a rock....basically no massage at all.  Today, I just tried the manicure to see if a different person would be better.  The standard massage was better, however, the gel polish application was no good...again gooped around my cuticles, and each nail of mine is filed into a different shape.  I now have to redo the whole thing myself.  Perhaps it is because I have not requested a particular nail person?  Possibly...the reviews I am reading that are other star seem to reference a particular person.  Maybe I will try one more time and request Kevin who seems to get good reviews.  If so, I will post again...hopefully with a better rating next time.  Right now this place is truly not worth more than two stars and those stars are only for good location, reasonable prices, and nice atmosphere.  I'd give zero stars for quality of manicure (gel polish) and pedicure.
other I really like this place!  I was surprised to see the other rating with one star.  I have been 3 times in the last other months- always for lunch and ordered off the menu.  The restaurant itself is clean and neat, and our food has always been fresh, hot and yes, "simple"- but really good.  You don't feel overly full (take the rest to go) and it's not greasy or heavy.  Good stuff.
other The food wasn't that good but that wasn't my main issue. It was the unwelcoming feeling I experienced. I will not be returning. The owner was friendly with everyone in the restaurant except my boyfriend and I. He would go table to table and talk to people and greet new customers and would acknowledge them when they left. The only acknowledgement I was received was an uncomfortable feeling of him staring at me when I wasn't looking, I'm assuming due to my abundance of tattoos. I felt judged and will not recommend this place to my friends or will never return.
other i adore this place! cute little shop, sweet owners, delish cookies - what more could you want?!?!?the urban was made for me. dark chocolate, coconut, and some nuts. uhhhhhh, hello, did i just wake up in heaven?their ice cream sandwiches are good - but i really wish they would make them on the spot, so you could get whatever cookies you wanted - right now it's all just standard chocolate cookies. a bit toooo sweet sometimes. i also had a special chocolate mint cookie sandwich, which was pretty good, but i had some serious chocolate overdose afterwards.not a huuuge fan of the cupcakes; i tried the brown velvet (i think that's what they called it). doesn't taste like red velvet, even though it's supposed to. but i mean, the place IS called urban COOKIES. yes, they are pricey, but what organic thing isn't?
3 Their service was above acceptable, but kind of slow. It was Wednesday night around 9pm and only one section in the restaurant was open for just a few groups. Their business looked very slow there. But I suppose it was a probably typical week night situation.
other Delicious, clean, great service! 3 hours later and we are still talking about how delightful this place was. We had the pulled pork and chicken sandwich - both were moist and fresh. Dinner for other for 20.00!
other Chipotle is my go to place when I feel like picking up a quick meal, and this happens to be my local one.Always busy, and you'll almost always see someone you know getting some delicious Chipotle as well.Portions are huge, but no complaining because it's all delicious!
other I'm not going to lie - I indulged in fantasies about Howard Roark during the course of my 90-minute Insights tour. His spirit and convictions were brought to life by FLW and being in this incredible complex where he lived, worked and taught was indescribably cool.  The tour takes you around the property and through many of the rooms, restored to various periods of Frank's life. I was a bit dismayed at the disrepair some of the rooms are in, so I spent money in the gift shop hoping it will go to repairing some sad looking chairs and windowpanes.  Overall, the tour guides are genius at describing and making you feel like you're seeing things through FLW's eyes with his vision on architecture and lifestyle.  This is not to be missed!
other I had my first meal at Miele's last night, and was pleasantly surprised.  I purchased a Groupon to the restaurant a month or so ago, and am glad that I did because otherwise may not have noticed this cute place amongst it's neighbors in the strip mall.We started with the brochette, and spent the next 10 minutes raving about how amazing it was.  The tomatoes were crisp and fresh, the chopped garlic was very complimentary, and the oil had a fantastic flavor.  Definitely a good choice.  For dinner I had the spaghetti and meatballs and my boy had the chicken toscana.  Both had a very authentic Italian flavor that accompanies food made with care.  The meatballs were everything I was craving...a little spicy and filled with flavor.  My portion left enough for leftovers, but Brent ate his entire meal.  We both left with a full belly and intentions to return again soon.I have no complaints about the food (delicious!), but docked the restaurant a star for two reasons:1. The lights are way too bright.  While I appreciate that the restaurant is more casual than some Italian joints I've been to, a dimmer switch on the overhead lights could do wonders for the atmosphere!2.  One of my favorite treats at Italian restaurants is bread dipped in tasty olive oil with fresh ground pepper and Parmesan cheese.  The bread is delicious, but the prepackaged butter that accompanied it didn't impress me.  I also would have liked freshly ground Parmesan on my spaghetti.We noticed a lot of pizzas being picked up for takeout, and both thought the bar looked like a cute little place to come have a drink and a bite sometime.Highly recommended and a great way to support a local business owner in Tempe!
other Thank you Yelp for my first opportunity to enjoy Gammage.Impressive architecture and design (it is also mostly functional)!  The seats are roomier than expected and the rows have just enough room between them to allow people to pass relatively easily in front of you without having to stand up to let them through.[Relative to US Airways Center seats which outside of Lexus Club and courtside seats are several inches narrower than the ones at Gammage and you have to stand up every time someone needs to pass.]Having the room to pass easily is nice, especially if you are seated in the middle of the auditorium, since you have to pass in front of at least 30 people just to get to your seat if your, say, running late or need to escape to the restroom.  This is also a negative especially if you are the crowd-fearing  or clostrophobic type, there are not good "outs" from the center.  I think it is wonderful to have a location that hosts wonderful Broadway performances and a variety of other artistic entertainment/performances.
other Am ashamed to say I have filled up my punch card, twice.  Usually get the Hook and Ladder.  But the main reason I keep going back...the magical Coke machine of Awesomeness.
other Pho is great every time, service is fast and friendly, potstickers are the best I have ever had and they are only $3.50.  Plus %10 discount for Intel employees.
other I finally made it to this place after hearing nothing but great reviews from others.  Now I can see why it is held in such high regard.  If you are a fan of Paradise Bakery, this place is better...hands down.  At first glance, it appears to be identical, but on closer look it wins in two important categories.  First, the vast menu blows away the Paradise selection of "like 3 items"  There are countless sandwhiches, salads, soups and deserts.  Second of all, the prices are incredible.  It is very affordable for the quality and quantity of food.  Finally, the food is excellent.   Not that I have a problem with Paradise, but given the choice, Wildflower wins every time..
other Ahh man,.....I REALLY wanted this to be good.But honestly, you end up with something that's more like "flame broiled" than the earthy wood-fired imagery you pick up from their corporately consistent signage, menu, and decor.That being said, it's a cool concept, and great crust- but the signature pizzas like the "Greek" end up feeling themed ,and lacking of soul and an intuitive fussing-over that they need to really be crack good.The salad's, while seemingly possessing all the right stuff- are the same. Too salty/ too soggy, and somehow too rich.The gelato tastes like it must come from a squeeze tube.Anyhow- enough bitching. Better than Pizza Hut, but for all the fuss and flash, you expect alot more.
other Lux is a great place for coffee, bakery items, bites, and even cocktails if the occasion permits. The people are friendly, and it has a great atmosphere.I love coming here in the afternoon for a cup of their Americano, which is pretty damn top-notch. As I don't live in AZ, if I'm going to be away for an extended period of time, I'm always sure to take a bag of their freshly-roasted coffee beans from wherever with me.I was there last week on a Sunday afternoon having some darn good mimosas with a friend, and it wasn't too crowded.The only downside I've experienced is it can be a bit confusing where to order for food and cocktails during the day.If you go for the first time, don't be shy. Grab a cup of coffee and explore. As one of the earlier reviewers mentioned, you might get looks walking in like you shouldn't be there. Maybe it's your hair. Maybe you're displaying something that's not eco-friendly. Whatever, dude. Be brave, press on. It's worth it.
other YUM!I can never remember what it is, but order the salad thing on pita bread!  It will change your life!  My co-workers and I would always go in here and share one of those and then we'd each get a slice of pizza.  Perfect amount of food- low prices- never too/disgustingly full.  Their bilinis are wonderful as well!
other Pats is predictable. In the retarded amount of times that I have eaten there, i've never been served pizza i'm unhappy with. Best pizza slices in Arizona with good prices. Generally stopping by for slices is the easiest way to find good service with little to no wait. Not always the friendliest workers, but that doesn't make my pizza take longer or taste any different!
other THIS PLACE IS GREAT IF YOU ARE TRAVELING WITH YOUR DOG!The double bed room was extremely clean and updated. Nice fluffy pillows and duvet covers. Bathrooms nice and new looking. The daily breakfast bar was wonderful and the sitting area clean and nice. The one issue was the AC. Jeez it was a rattle bucket and kept us up at night. we would turn it off until we would wake up sweating and then turn it on for an hour, wake up and turn it off.....oh brother.  I would have liked a good night sleep, since everything else was nice. Pets welcome and that was a bonus.
other eewh! yuck and wtf!?This Barnes & Noble Book Store sucks for sitting back, relaxing and trying to read. I know it is not a library, and I don't expect it to be. But, come on - you can at least have some sense of trying to keep the noise level down and have some cozy seating. And... Yikes! The people here are gross. They had some couch-chairs to lounge in and they were - in all of their grossness. And they were reading magazines of all things. WTF buy it and go home and let your kids do kart wheels there. EEWH!Then, those of us who actually purchased books and were trying to peacefully read them were in the cafe' - sitting on their dirty wooden benches - where I guess the servers there think that part of theirs jobs in serving coffee is to do a drum solo every time they empty the used coffee grinds into the trash can - which was about every other minutes. Yeesh! Luckily, I had my iPod. It was blasting and I still could hear them banging away. It was not a very cleanly area either. I was going to ask if they had wifi but I just high-tailed it out of there instead. This place is small too and their book selection is limited.I have been looking for a place to go to read, work and drink some coffee in my area (Arrowhead) and this one is definitely crossed off of my list. Come here to try and find a book but don't come expecting to kick back and enjoy your novel or what have you. If you like people watching though, this may be your place. There are all kinds here.PS: and I left my fav coffee mug at this crappy place - like I will go back and get it. I think I would burn it first - bummer!
other wouldnt you agree that a key part of enjoying the dining experience in part depends upon the company you are dining with?!  having said that, the times i have dined at abuelos have been with my fellow co-workers, all female, and yes, we all get along!  needless to say, we had totally fun & memorable experiences, filled with great conversations, great food and good prices.  their corn chips are fresh and lite, their salsa comes in different levels of heat.  i usually request the hot salsa.  i'm partial to their chicken enchilada.  portions are just right, one is plenty for me, usually served with rice.  in all fairness, believe i need to sample other dishes, before i could rate it any higher.  found another great restaurant in chandler, az!  top3 reasons why...1- great tasting dish 2- good value  3- atmosphere (location, service, ambience)
other basically, i'm only reviewing this store because i really do not care for the employees here. there are a few nice ones, but overall, they are either cranky, stressed out, or missing.the redeeming points? a nice selection of crafting products. but then again, you can always just go to a DIFFERENT location. i'd opt for that.
other They have the nicest staff and the Dr. is always open when examining our dog! We have boarded her there as well and the staff is so kind, and when our dog gets there she cant wait to run up and play with the staff!
other Love love love this place.  Great appetizers and cocktail menu.  Must visit in Old Town Scottsadale
other Be sure to save up for the $3000 coffee machine they demo'd for me! Nuts! I could never imagine paying as much for a coffee machine as I would for a used car!I am really wanting to take one of the cooking classes they offer here. Soon maybe... Hoping for a Sur Le Table Groupon!
other We got passes for the preview of Mission Impossible (Ghost Protocol).  We enjoyed the movie a lot.  The theater itself is fine.  The chairs don't move, and you can't raise the arm rests.  No rocking, no reclining (granted most theater seats don't move a lot, but these don't move at all).  Otherwise the seats were reasonably comfortable.  The screen is IMAX (i.e. huge), and the sound was reasonably good.  They could have put a little more slope into the auditorium seating.  In other IMAX theaters I've been in it seemed the heads of people in front of you NEVER block any portion of the screen.  But I found a few were just slightly into the bottom of the screen.  It wasn't bad, but given my other IMAX experiences I did notice it.
other I wish that this place were not so good - I have not been able to drink the coffee at my office in weeks.  The location that One Coffee occupies used to be a coffee shop graveyard.  Several coffee houses went out of business in this location, unable to compete with Starbucks.  One Coffee has bucked that trend and it is not hard to see why.  One Coffee has great coffee and it is amazingly consistent.  The staff is always friendly.  This place is certainly doing something right; everytime I go in there it has more and more customers.
other The Great Indoors is a phenomenal place to get lost and dream about what you would like to have your home look like.  WARNING!!!  You will want to spend money!On average their prices are pretty run of the mill dept. store style, it is their selection that is amazing.  They have far more selection than any other store I have ever been to.  The store is also well organized and laid out and everything is easy to find.One final note, while not a place for extreme bargain hunters if you play your cards right you can get some great deals.  I just purchased all of our appliances for our home at a 20% discount.  Again, not the best discount I have seen but getting them all at once, not having to look around, and still getting $other back for every $10 I spend is pretty darn nice!Oh and if you need appliances, ask for Andy/Andrew... He is a great help and honest as can be!
other I eat a lot of Asian food (of different sorts).  Asian is actually my go-to cuisine since I have a lot of food allergies.  This place deserves a thumbs-down, unless you love Americanized Asian.  The food was bland, breaded and just not worth any money.  Next time I'm in Phoenix, I definitely won't eat here.
other I like this store. It is not perfect, it is not a real farmer's market, but they have many things which other stores do not carry. First of all, their fresh sausages made from scratch daily are to die for. Even if you don't like the store overall, just go there, buy a few different sausages and grill them with 100% natural wood charcoal. (Please, do not use lighter fluid! Take a piece of bounty, soak it in some cheap olive oil and you will ignite anything)If you see 1other different kinds of sausage and don't know which one you may like, ask for their sausage menu; there is a description and list of all ingredients.Then lets go to their meat department. Grass fed meet. It is not something you will see at any regular store. Is it good? It is worth extra? I'm a skeptic, but I found it to be way better than a regular meat.  Grass fed ground beef was so good! We made burgers and I could definitely taste the difference. Grass fed filet mignon was also very nice. It was not better than USDA prime filet mignon from Costco, but it was way better than regular corn fed  filet mignon. I wish farmers would go back to the old times, when they were not controlled by other corporations and nobody was forcing cows to eat corn, but I digress...Need real organic eggs and willing to pay $other per dozen? No problem, they are here. Frankly, I could not tell that these organic eggs were way better than regular eggs for half the price, but maybe people who bake can tell the difference...Also, if you're looking for that particular brand of sour cream, butter, kefir  (lowfat yogurt), most likely, you will find it there - they carry many different brands and it seems they do not favor one over another. Try organic bananas and tell me they taste the same as regular ones. They do not, they are way better, they have flavor and they are sweet. They almost taste like bananas you would get on Caribbean islands. The one they sell to you the same day they take it off the tree... when it was already yellow and ripe Try peaches and apricots from Chile. They taste like peaches and apricots. Yes, some will have marks, dents and will not look perfect, you have to select, but I rather spend 3 extra minutes picking good ones than get tasteless, but all perfectly looking fruits.Now, bad. Of course, they do not always have best fruits and vegetables and a lot of them have a tag "Mexico". It is unfortunate that "grown in Mexico" is associated with poor produce nowadays. Mexico has a great climate and they can definitely grow tasty, pesticide free fruits and vegetables. Unfortunately, the market drives demand in a capitalist economy. Many people still look for huge and cheap. Companies provide huge and cheap. Some people are poor, they don't have money to buy quality produce and overpay for organic.  It is sad, but unless we stop buying crappy produce, organic will be super expensive for a while (no competition).These huge see through plastic bins filled with different nuts seems like a great idea at first, but way too unsanitary. People open these bins with their dirty hands, dip into them, cough and sneeze next to them and that's where you get your nuts from? No way! At least, not for me.Fish section looks sad, which seems to be a trend in every AZ supermarket. You can find better fish in our area at Costo (huge amounts, good for big families), sometimes AJs (not always though), Mekong plaza supermarket or Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket. That's it.  if you know any other places where I can get fish which does not smell fishy, please let me know.A lot of their organic produce, including potato is wrapped with a sticky label which says organic on every item. Ughh... it was so annoying to remove wrap around labels from every potato that at the end I didn't not care for the taste - I just wanted to finish peeling them. I guess, the store has to identify organic food somehow, but these extremely sticky labels are not a good idea. Think of something else, Sprout.So, this Sprout store is not perfect, but I will continue visiting it every week and look forward to some  improvements in the future.
other My love affair with Pita Jungle is a long one.....perhaps longer than any other restaurant, certainly longer than I can remember, and at least for the adult portion of my life, which is why it pains me to write this review. For the last 6 months, I have ordered takeout one day a week from this location, typically on a Friday or Saturday. The ridiculousness that has become my adult life has necessitated a heavy reliance on takeout for my main source of nourishment. Although the food is always spot on at Pita, my takeout experience has been anything but. The prior 3 out of other times I went to pick up my food, I ended up waiting past the promised time. Now I'm not unreasonable, waiting other or 10 minutes is not a big deal, but each time has been a wait of 2other to 30+ minutes past the pick up time, with no apologies or explanations. I was beginning to wonder if they had ever started cooking my food before I got there. The last time I must've looked really irritated, because I was offered an obligatory baklava for my wait. Used to the wait, I started showing up other to 10 minutes past the promised time, just as preventative maintenance. Imagine my surprise when my order was ready as promised thie time. I left with my bag of food and a smile on my face. I get back to my friend's house, open the bag, and begin to realize just how badly the order has been screwed up. We ordered other items, 3 of which were wrong. I load one item up and head back to Pita. Making me wait a ridiculous amount of time for my food is one thing, but blatantly screwing up my order is too much. As I explain my situation to the takeout girl, she goes to get the Manager who proceeds to inform me that I ordered it wrong. As I struggle to keep my cool, I inform them that they must be mistaken. One item was ordered with chicken, my item was turkey, and the other two were salads. Everything came with chicken. The salads were for my vegetarian friends, and I'm allergic to chicken. There's no way you're going to convince me I ordered chicken for myself and two vegetarians. Sorry, try again. Without too much ado, the correct dishes were provided, and yet another obligatory baklava was offered. I declined. There is only so much wrong that baklava can right. Don't get me wrong, their baklava is amazing, but it's not going to make up for them screwing up my order, then trying to blame it on me. Oh, and did I mention that they gave me a coupon for a free appetizer? Too bad the coupon expires in a few days. I'm afraid I will be taking my weekly Friday takeout business elsewhere, until enough time has passed that maybe, just maybe, I can find it in my heart to forgive Pita Jungle. In the meantime, I suggest you try to get it together down there. In case you missed the count, that's other out of the last other takeouts you missed the mark on, including other you tried to blame on me. That's shameful.
other I didn't eat here, so I guess I can't give a full review. But I did have a beer, and I did take the Orbit to downtown Tempe, and I walked over here and had a yummy pint for other bucks on Sunday evening. The more places that I can drink then take a bus home, the better.
3 I'm always on the lookout for cool places to bring out of town friends and this place seemed to fit the bill.  It's a sustainable farm that produces Arizona's only extra virgin olive oil.  I came in for lunch and as I pulled into the GRAVEL parking lot my stomach turned because I had expensive heels on and knew they were going to take a beating (I know, "waaah" right? But there are women out there that love their shoes as much as I do and will appreciate the heads-up).  Once I entered the Olive Mill I was delighted to see how adorably quaint it was inside.  The building was split in two, market on one side, bistro on the other with seating in between both and also outside.  The market had testers of all their products, great idea but the food testers didn't seem sanitary so I didn't try anything.  I ended up buying some awesome hand balm that I love.  They had a really great wine selection as well.  Alright so here's the bad part.  The entire time I was there, not one employee greeted me or cracked a smile.   There was one guy in particular that was going back and forth stocking shelves and was visibly annoyed by my presence.  When I went to order my sandwich, I remembered I got a free drink with my Yelp check-in.  The girl at the counter sighed and rolled her eyes as I scrambled through my purse to find my iphone and she said "forget it, I got it."  Their sandwich the "Kalamata" had its 1other seconds of fame on the food network so I was going to get that but opted for the "Lucca" at the last second because it has brie...I love brie more than I love most family members.  The sandwich was a disappointment.  All the ingredients were there but it was devoid of any flavor and I couldn't figure out why.  I probably won't be bringing any of my homies here but I will drop by to buy products, I fully support local businesses.
other We were in town on Business and Pleasure and had a chance to visit Aiello's with our Children, 10 and 7.  What a TREMENDOUS experience it was overall and then to top it all off, a chance to win "dinner on the house" via drawing a number out of a bucket, was simply superb.  We didn't win but will definitely come back next time we are in town as the food, staff, and overall dining experience was unbeatable!
3 I don't eat a lot of pasta and I don't come here all the time.  However, I think the salad with pesto dressing and the garlic Mizithra (spaghetti with bacon, mushrooms, brown butter and cheese) are very good.  I have heard that the other stuff is good, too.  I have only been here for lunch, so I don't know what dinner is like. Sit in the trolley car -- you can ring the bell!It is located conveniently off the light rail stop at Central and McDowell, near the Phoenix Main Library.
other We love this restaurant. It's a family-owned place and you always feel welcome. The food is excellent, especially compared to On the Border, etc.Order the guacamole.A tad pricey but it's North Scottsdale, so what do we expect?
other Cozy, cute and yes, a little claustraphobic...Coronado Cafe. Perhaps the latter adjective is my own issue, but at other foot  9 inches I felt REALLY tall. An adorable little home, with creaky wooden floors transformed into a comfortable cafe with approachable American fare. After navigating the dicey, sandy, lumpy parking lot I accidentally entered the kitchen door. My bad. I was redirected to another door and entered through the rear. Yikes did I  just say I entered through the rear? Anyway a lovely staff person told me to go to the front and check in. Meandering through the cafe I really did find it lovely. Very neat, old yet modern and strangely very loud. It was a booming lunch crowd on a Monday. Taking Mom and Dad out for a Mother's Day lunch. We waited a few minutes for a table and were constantly being said hello to and asked if we've been helped by a friendly, friendly staff. Shout out to the staff! The menu, while not especially inventive, seemed fresh and yummy. The soup of the day was a tortilla soup with its own stamp on it. No tortilla strips atop the cup, yet and especially flavorful soup, creamy with a twinge of tanginess to it. Mom and I both had the turkey sandwich with cranberrry sauce. HUGE mother of a sandwich. I always wonder about the big sandwich because you cannot possible bite into it without making a mess. Not a strike against them, cuz it was very good, bread was fresh and turkey seemed unprocessed. Dad ordered the ham and cheese, but stripped away all the interesting flavors, because, well, because he's a dad and likes the meat and potato type menu. Dessert was a wonderful and decedent brownie with ice cream, chocolate and caramel sauces. Very good. Brownie was more like a cake though. Again, no complaint, cuz it was dee-lish. Service was so great I have to say. Friendly, professional and fun. I like the idea of eating in an old house. The contrast of old Phoenix with striking photography of modern New York strewn about the rooms was quite cool. I recommend a visit. I'm craving the tortilla soup and would love to try other items on the menu. Most importantly it was a wonderful way to hang with mom and dad (who ventured in from Sun City in their mini van, navigating the Central Ave. mess, God Bless 'em) and we truly had a good experience. Coronado Cafe. Cute. Cozy. Comfortable. And in the end, not so claustraphobic.
other Fun place for breakfast.  Prices were reasonable and food was good.
3 Cherry on Top is a rare example of design by market analysis committee, who couldn't decide on a unique concept so they decided to "borrow" from all of their competitors' styles, turning out at least as well as if not better than its individual inspirations.The result provides convenient answers to the following frozen yogurt questions:- Can't decide between tart and traditional? Why not both?- Can't decide between standard or high-end sweet? Mix vanilla, taro, green tea, cheesecake (but only at your own risk.)- Feeling constrained by four fit all sizes? $0.39/oz., cup weight subtracted.- Wavering on the topping healthiness spectrum? Fruit to sugar cereal to nuts to crushed big brand candy available.The quality is close enough to most of the relevant rivals (as long as one is not requiring the desert honey Sweet Republic tart variant) but, correctly and perhaps intentionally, the value proposition is that most patrons won't care about the slight dip, trading off for the flexibility of purchasing (only) as much yogurt and toppings as desired while satisfying Hershey's-acclimated children with a Frankenstein of saccharine flavors and junk toppings as well guests from the city pining for the nearest Pinkberry with original tart plus kiwi, strawberries, blackberries and pineapple.
other Great location.  Nice decor.  The food was adequate, but $13 for the turkey pastrami sandwich was a little high for a lunch.  I guess those chandeliers are expensive and rent at the Waterfront cannot be cheap.  Our server was poorly trained.  She placed the food in front of me instead of the lady first. I asked for water and the server brought only one glass of water and didn't bother to ask about the lady's needs.  This venue is not for those who appreciate fine or even appropriate service.  Sam needs to educate his young servers on the finer points of courtesy.  Our server was also extremely bored with her job, her life, and her existence.  That's the impression we received.
other Being the pho addict that I am,I'm always on the lookout for a new place to satisfy the craving.This place was called Tu Do for a long time.It was aplace that never seemed crowded,with an older Vietnamese lady as theonly cook.The place was run down and the service indifferent ( I know these traits are not uncommon in Vietnamese restaurants).Then it wascalled The Ritz for a while,with a remodeled interior but with the same lady doing the cooking.Now,the restaurant has new ownership,a local Vietnamese family,and it's a whole new ball game.  I ordered my usual pho tai bo vien with goi coun (spring rolls) as anappetizer.I'd give the soup a thumbs up.The broth was well balanced,a bit on the oily side (that's not a bad thing for me),not the strongest northe weakest in town.The basil was fresh,the meat was of good quality and quantity.They didn't skimp on the noodles.On the down side,theyuse those meatballs that have a more rubbery texture than most,and they only give you 3 of them (other is the norm).Overall it was a good bowl of pho,but it's not going to unseat Maxim or Khai Hoan as my favorites in metro Phoenix.The spring rolls were above average,with no shortage of shrimp,and peanut sauce that tastes like peanuts,not hosin.  The service is much more attentive now,and these folks seem eager toplease.Also worth mention is that Phuong Dong is inexpensive.Not quitePho Thanh and Da Vang cheap,but pretty close.Another good thing is thatthey are open very late on friday  and saturday, 1:00am! Late night pho fix!They also serve beer. I like this place,I'm looking forward to trying the Canh Chua Tom.I hope they succeed.
other I grew up in Arizona and we went to Wongs every Sunday after church.  Three years ago we got stationed in Hawaii.  Everytime I come home, our first stop is Wongs.  I love everything about it.  Wongs is my comfort food.
other I do love rum and should review the Rum Bar separately but both the Rum Bar and the Breadfruit restaurant are equally awesome! Great recommendations from the waiter... Brown Stew Chicken and Jerk Chicken are really good... really spicy on the jerk chicken but thats somewhat expected and perfect for me! I'll take my plantains baked over fried any day! SO GOOD! Really great place to go for not so typical food! The entire place is quite small in a perfect intimate way.  Their seems to be a lot of pride in the menu, environment and service, which is rare to see in restaurant employees. Not to mention a perfect location ... very walkable to other nearby bars and easy to make a whole night of downtown phoenix!
3 Durant's has that old, musty, dark, Mafia feel. Love the atmosphere and allure. We mainly sit at the bar, but have dined in. The happy hour specials are good, and we have tossed a few back here having great talks and enjoying the ambiance.Now for the bad: The food is overpriced for it's quality. The steaks look fatty, the salads wilted, and flavor pretty bland. It would probably be okay if we weren't looking at 20 plus dollars per entree. Back in the day, Durant's was very high end and elite, so I could see the pricing from that perspective. However, if they want to stay in the game, they need to keep the food up to par as well. other stars plus for ambiance, relaxation, a throw back feel, and great drinks! other star for food and food prices. However, a major landmark in Phoenix, so please check it out! We never know how long these staples will be around. I would just recommend going for drinks and maybe split an appetizer. It does ignite the "romantic mood" and will leave you reflecting on those "good old days".
other Great breakfast place and much better than Panera. Tried the lemon pancake....mmmm very good. Also had the portabella sandwich....too much on tomato but still good. After eating my gf let out a big burp in front of everyone.....well done. They have some breads that you can buy here as well.
other i dont know why i didn't fall in love with pita jungle sooner. i work right next to the mall so the food court is super convenient for us. let me tell you a story of how i ate here everyday for lunch for a week. i ordered a standard gyro with no pickles (they put pickles on their gyros and i find that disgusting) my coworker, jen, ordered the pasta salad with chicken on top. mine was delicious and i tasted hers. hers was so good! i was like, that's what i'm ordering tomorrow.the next day we went again and i ordered the chicken pasta. while waiting for the food to come out someone in front of me picked up their order of a hummus trio with chicken on top and a side of pita.the next day jen asked where i wanted to go to lunch. i said pita jungle and i got my hummus trio. and the trend continued. their food is so good!!!! and its like $8!! and since i work nearby i get a discount! today i had a side of chicken breast with super fresh mushrooms. i watched them steam them, then put them in a pan with w tons of garlic, red wine, and seasoning. some of the best mushrooms i've ever had and it was a HUGE order of mushrooms.i love this place!
other After spending a combined seven years as a graduate student at ASU, imagine my dissapointment when I came to discover that there was finally decent Asian food walking distance from campus... two months after my departure for internship in San Diego. Dragonfly combines what I like about Vietnamese food (variety, flavor, price) with what I like about a modern, trendy restaurant (good decor, modern music, attentive servers). Though everything on the menu is above average, one item really stands out; cha gio cream cheese. I believe at this location it's called tiger rolls. Completely inauthentic, and I couldn't care less. DAMN they're good. When I drive in from San Diego, I often head there on my first night in town, occasionally as soon as I hit the Phoenix area, before stopping off to drop off my bags. Honestly one of the best things I've tasted anywhere. Highly highly recommend.
3 My experience at Old Town Tortilla Factory is probably very different than that of the average patron. I dined here with a semi-private party with 40 other guests and we were served buffet-style.Our group was seated in their outdoor dining area, which I absolutely loved. I thought the atmosphere was great and brought an authentic Southwest feel and vibe to the restaurant. The food was as decent as you would expect sharing buffet-style with 40 other people lined up outdoors: nothing mind-blowingly memorable, but nothing too bad, either.My one complaint would be the servers. Especially at our single table of 8, it did not seem the server we were assigned was equipped to take care of a large group. There was much unnecessary confusion at the end of the night when it came down to settling some bar tabs. Overall, it did not ruin our experience, but definitely took away from the overall positivity. Regardless, I would love to come back here with a smaller group and enjoy a fresh plate of food! The outdoor dining is definitely something you can't pass up...
3 The classic example of why we need half stars.  Doesn't merit a four star endorsement but slightly better than the three star Meh.  The hot dogs are decent but you'd expect more due to the pedigree of the owners.  The place also doesn't feel well put together and like it's been neglected in recent times.
other Ate here at lunch today for the first time. "eh" is all I can say. I came in around 12:4other and even though no one was behind me in line the twerp at the counter made me feel very rushed. I ordered a Turkey Tom. This was basically a big white dried out sandwich roll with a couple of slices of turkey, a butt-load of shredded lettuce, a couple of sliced tomatoes and some mayo (I requested no sprouts which are normally also included). What is supposed to be gourmet about that? The sprouts?  I also grabbed a chocolate chunk cookie. Not even worth eating the whole cookie. Really. I see no reason to return and don't understand how they can call themselves gourmet...
3 A-OK is right and the hype is not always worth the wait. I will keep it simple since there are probably 500 reviews on the place.Pros:Great Hashbrowns, and made from scratch foodGood specials to keep things mixed upGreat company and serviceCons:Guy up front says a little over 3other minutes but really means an hour and 4other minutesPricey for some dishesInteresting people around while you wait to get inside (street walkers, etc.)the fresh squeezed orange juice is enough liquid to maybe fill up a double shot glassOverall I would love to give this place more stars if I could get in there without wanting to eat a finger due to starvation, and leave a bit more satisfied. Anyone who has eaten at Bryan's in San Diego would know what I mean.
3 Bit over priced, but they're tea is to die for!
other The best Vietnamese I have ever had. Very authentic menu (not even in English). Great service and knowledgeable staff. The ambiance is lackluster, but this is typical with Vietnamese food. Great for dining in quickly or taking home.
3 DVAP....You have to go at least once in your life. It really is a neat place with alot of history. The service is great, it appears to be family run. The food is good. Better then Dennys but not as good as Mimi's. I had the all u can eat of beef ribs, lasagna, meat loaf, cat fish, chicken, mashed and diced potatoes, stuffing, rice, homemade apple pie, etc and salad bar. I know I am missing a bunch of stuff they had but you get the drift. They run specials on Prime rib and stuff so you might want to call to see what they are serving the night you go.
3 I have been to Butters on numerous occasions - the latest being with three senior golfing friends from out of town.  Over the last few years, we have tried numerous breakfast places on their trips, searching for a breakfast that would satisfy all of their different tastes.  After trying six or seven different places, I brought them to Butters, since it was on our way to the golf course. We all ordered something different, including a skillet, bacon and eggs, pancakes, and an omelette.  The service was fast, and friendly. In fact, we have one picky eater, who always sends his bacon back, because it isn't as crisp as he demands.  The waitress handled his grumbling very nicely, and even had him laughing about it.The atmosphere is somewhat trendier than Butterfields, which was a very big plus for my senior friends.  They also commented on the friendly service, and the reasonable prices. It didn't surprise me that when it came time for breakfast on the final three days they were here, they all voted to come to Butters for breakfast.It should be noted that we came on the weekdays when it isn't as busy on the weekends. I have been in the area on weekends, and it always appears that there is a waiting line.The only thing keeping it from more stars, are the hash browns.  They are obviously prepackaged (or at least taste that way) - and a real breakfast place should have signature hash browns.  But all in all, a nice addition to the area.
3 I can't help but feel the same sentiment as Nathan S. - I sort of feel bad giving this place only 3 stars with all the other rave reviews. Let me start with the positives -  I love love that the place is so small and intimate.  Especially in comparison to most Valley restaurants that are just cavernous.  And with the European-style seating you have to get friendly with your neighbors.  Both of these things make this feel like a good NY restaurant. I also love the atmosphere and decor in general.  Very authentic Spanish, very laid back, not all hip and modern like most restaurants try to be these days. The service was extremely friendly, from the hostess to all of the waiters and waitresses and bus boys that came by. My husband really liked the Sangria (Tinto) - he said it wasn't very strong but tasted great. Indeed, all of the food tasted very good.  Our two favorite dishes happened to be the daily specials - the Eggplant Barcelona and the Turkish Custard dessert.  But the Tortilla Patatas and the Gambas and the Spinach with Garbanzos were all great as well. Now to the negatives -  Firstly, selection was dreadful all around.  The wine list was very minimal, and the very limited bar didn't help.  And there were only about 8 dishes to choose from.  When I go for Tapas, the whole point is having a wide variety of small plates to choose from! Every dish was DROWNED in oil.  Literally, bowls of oil.  The food just sat in my stomach afterwards, and I felt like I needed to take a shower to rid myself of all the grease. The sizes of the dishes were very inconsistent.  I know it's tapas, and I love me some tapas, but generally at tapas places I find you could likely split each dish three ways.  The Gambas and the Spinach were both huge piles that could have been split up to other ways.  But then the Tortilla Patatas was barely large enough to split two ways, and then our two favorite dishes - the Eggplant Barcelona and the Turkish Custard - were both smaller than a deck of cards and splitting them just two ways left us each with a single forkful of food.  There was a party of other next to us that put in other order of the Pork Tenderloin and the waitress said, "You should really get other or 3 orders of that so everyone can try some."  3 orders for other people to try it?! Then, right along with the food size is the price.  $90 (incl tip) for the other tapas mentioned above, plus a glass of sangria, other glasses of wine, the dessert, and an espresso.  other of the tapas were one bite per person.  Yikes. The food, while good, was nothing outstanding.  There was no dish that made me stop and say "wow, now that is well done."  They were solid but not amazing.  (As opposed to the Lomo Embuchado at Cobras y Matadors in LA that I was ready to marry and make babies with).So all in all, I'd say a 3.other star experience, rounded down because it just wasn't a other for me.  I can't help but compare this place to my favorite tapas place in the valley, Sol y Sombra in the DC Ranch, where they have a huge selection of fantastic wine (and a full bar) and a huge selection of delicious and much larger portioned tapas for the same price.
other Chai is alive and well, and living at City Center at City North.I had been dating a gal name Starbucks for the past few years. She was a plain gal, generic if you will.  She was dependable and available. I was feeling as if i needed more out of my relationship, as you can imagine. So, at times, I would cheat on my gal with another gal named Coffee Bean. Coffee Bean was Kosher and a bit edgier, yet had a leaner list of qualities. I needed more out of my relationships. They say that when you're not looking for someone new, they appear. Well, that was the case with my new crush named Press. I had been to High Street for dinner Kona Grill, yet most of the other shops and restaurants were closed or not yet open for business at the time. I ventured back during daytime hours to give them another opportunity.  I had heard about Press, so I was more than excited to give it a go. At this point I was still making caffeine a part of my diet, so i ordered something called a "Dirty Chai." This was a Chai with espresso shots. Press uses a powdered Chai which, in my opinion, works better than the liquid or tea bag forms. I was also given the option to have my frothy delight in a ceramic cup.  I opted for that.  I felt like i was having the type of coffee house experience I had only just imagined. Press occupies a well appointed space, too.  From the wood and granite, to the stained concrete floors, I felt as if i were in a European city, not a Phoenix strip mall. The free wi-fi is a major plus, in my opinion. Press goes as far as to have a "dog friendly" cart outside, in its ample outdoor seating area. I spoke with Steve, the owner of Press, at length.  In talking, I asked how Press came to be, and he said that his wife had wanted to open a coffee shop one day.  Well Steve, you have certainly exceeded her expectations, as well as the residents of the Greater Phoenix area. By the way, Press serves sandwiches and soups, as well as an extensive list of wines. Check it out, the staff will make you feel at home, or like you're on vacation in the cozy European city of your choice.
other I took my 6-year-old son here for his first taste of frozen yogurt.  There is only one size of cup to choose from, and that is a little inconvenient.  You have to make sure you don't fill it to the top.  I had chocolate, and my son had a mix of cake batter, red velvet cake batter, and oreo.  They were all good.  In addition to those flavors, they had vanilla, tart, butterfinger, pomegranate, and a couple others I can't quite remember.  There were a lot of toppings to choose from.  Chocolate chip cookies, cut up moon pie, dark chocolate, white chocolate, and milk chocolate chips, karob chips, sugar free chocolate pieces, mochi, colored mochi, every crushed up candy bar you can imagine, lots of fruits, 4-other different syrups, gummy bears, gummy worms, sour gummy twizzlers, gigantic marshmallows, and whipped cream.  There were many more things, but I can't quite remember them all.  It was the largest selection I've seen, but I'm pretty new to AZ and haven't had experience with that many frozen yogurt shops.  The employees were really helpful.  Everything was spotlessly clean, and the yogurt was really great.  We will be back.
other They are the best!  99% of my pain in my back is gone, thanks to Patrick O'Brien and assistant Joshua.Bonnie Wills
other A must!  One of the BEST dog food stores in the Valley!  Great service and quality, natural feed products for your dog.   You can rest at peace knowing that your pets are in GREAT hands.Mark Siebelhttp://www.doggiestepsdogtraining.com/
other The service here was wonderful, really friendly and personable. And the food was OUTSTANDING! That Brulee burger was perfection, paired with some fries and a marshmallow shake. I wanted to stay in town another day, just to come back here to eat!
other I love the urban feel of this place, and the swanky Apple Store is a big enough draw for me! The place is brand new, so not too many things are going on yet, but more stores are opening all the time! There's now a really high-end iPic movie theater, a frozen yogurt place, a great Nike store, and much more to come in addition to H&M, West Elm, and the delicious Oakville Grocery Co. Parking is fine and it's easy to navigate. When you're done here you can walk to Kierland across the street, too! :)Can't wait to see what they do here in a few years!
other What a great way to spend Easter morning!After taking part in the egg hunt on the main grounds (and BTW, they know how to do it here: Massive dumps of eggs full of goodies. More than the kids could carry. Plenty of photo ops. Parents who weren't acting out scenes from Soylent Green.) we made our way to this nicely upscale coffee shop/casual dining spot. We were seated 30 minutes ahead of our reservation, keeping my little guy from popping a gasket. I chose the $19 breakfast buffet, and considering it included a custom-made omelette with organic ingredients--as well as juice and coffee--it was a steal. Service was wonderful and the staff was sure to make us feel at home. Well, actually better than home because I don't have people looking after my every whim and need while at home.
other I did not know I could still be creative since it had been years since I had done anything that involves even a minor level of creativity.But what fun was this!A girl friend took initiative here to organize a kitchen tea on a recent Saturday afternoon. We were a table of 6 girl friends that were scheduled for some pottery making! My initial idea of this venue was admittedly a little different but better than expected in so many ways!For one we did not have to get all that dirty. Not dirty at all really. Also not that I mind dirty. This is for those who wonder whether to go or not to go.And two - we were able to bring along our own food and drinks which made for excellent responsibility sharing in the wining and dining arena.Once we were set up with our party arrangements and have had some snacks and champagne we were inspired to start our artistic journey. The idea was to have each of the 6 friends make a dinner plate (or item of the bride to be's choice) which we will then give to her as a wedding present. I thought this idea was really original.So the bride to be selected her dinner plates of choice after which we were briefed by a very friendly and sweet staff member as to the different effects that the paint will have once the plates were baked. All informed we went to select the different colors we needed for our different art works.Everybody started painting and each one of us got really involved with their own creation. The event took us much longer than we anticipated but in such a good way. We finished about other hours after starting off but much enlightened by the activity.Everybody agreed that we will have to go here again for the sheer enjoyment and good feeling of togetherness it promoted. I have not yet seen the end product as one of our friends went to pick up our designs - but we will presenting our collective gift to the bride to be soon :)Go go here for a stimulating outing with good friends/family/kids!
other Awesome! I highly recommend this place! Incredible atmosphere inside and out, the bar design is superb and the patio is the perfect spot for relaxing and enjoying drinks with friends. I went for the second time recently and have to give this place a stellar review. The menu is innovative and fresh! The mixed drinks are killer and the wine on tap was an extremely pleasant surprise. Plus, you can't beat their happy hour seven days a week!  I have had the crab cake BLT and the halibut sandwich, which were both out of this world! Everything I saw coming out of the kitchen looked amazing and I can't wait to go back and try all the others.  The servers were great and knowledgeable about their menu which is always a big plus! As a parent, I love that this place is a perfect day/night out spot for a date or hanging with friends but also a family oriented neighborhood joint where I can bring my kiddo along! Love that Churn is right next door to get some yummy dessert after an incredible meal!  The design is spot on for this area! Great job!
other Hands down, the best pizza in the East Valley!!!! Tastes like I'm back in New York City, that's how good the pizza is! They do all sorts of combinations and toppings. Mmmm mmmm good. The hero sandwiches and wings are good too. Located in a strip mall next to AMC movie theaters, it's a great place to go before or after the movies. And they deliver, too. Much better quality than chain pizzerias.
other I love Honey Bear's!  I've been visiting their restaurants for years.  I've been to the one on Van Buran, the one on Central and this one in Tempe.  They have the runniest sauce on earth but dang it tastes great!  I love the pulled pork sandwiches but not the long lines at lunch.  When I went after 1pm in the afternoon I stood in a line of one - me.
other Stopped by for a beer and a snack.  Temp was around 70 so we sat outside.My amber ale from Breckenridge was good, and my wife ordered the cheaper of their Pinot Noir's and it was also good.  Waiter was friendly and genuine.I like their anti pasti menu.  You can pick and choose what you want.  We tried the 12-hour roasted tomatoes, olives, some almonds, manchego cheese, and sopresseta.  It was all good.We are eager to go back and eat dinner - the menu looked appetizing.
other This was such a good experienceI was up all night with a extremely severe painful tooth acheI don't have health insurance so I didn't think I could afford a dentistFriends and Family told me to look up a dental school and thats how I found A.T. StillI called and they said they accept five Emergency patients a day at 1:pmIt was 11am but I didn't care I drove straight there and I was the first patient seen at 1p.m.it cost $1other to be seen, $1other for the X-Rays, and turns out my wisdom tooth was infected and had a cavityso they sent me up to oral surgery, it cost me $8other to get the tooth extractedi was nervous and they talked me through it and calmed my fearsIt didn't hurt at all, I was numbed up and the student did a good jobthey gave me a three prescriptions to take with me and I have to return next week for follow - upthe follow up appointment is FREE!totally recommend this place to any and everyone!
other My husband and I went tonight to teakwoods for the first time. We had a groupon. The place was packed.  Different football games going on tvs all over the place. I didn't mind, but my hubby was in heaven:)   Hostess told us every table was full except outside. So went outside, turned right around because I forgot about smokers, lol.    We waited about other min and the hostess asked us if we would mind sharing a table with another couple. We said sure.  There was 6 chairs  and other of us total so other empties inbetween us. It was same as if we had our own table. Worked out great:) We started off with the jess Jess boneless wings- Delish!!!!! Not wet like other wings in fact I think they coat them and then throw them on the grill. We Loved them!I ordered a southern thang burger - my  hubby got a Teaks touch ém all. They were huge!  We each ended up taking half home.  Not just huge but tasty. I loved mine.    We decided to pay and use the groupon another time to ensure we would remember to come back:)Great place- waitress nice and friendly, good food- we will eat there again!
other Excellent
other BEAUTIFUL! Phoenix doesn't get much more amazing then when you're looking down at her from Dobbins Lookout.A few tips:1. Get there before 6pm. The park closes the entry but if you're in, you can stay as long as you want. 2. Be ready for a drive up a mountain -- scary cliffs and tight corners. Make sure you go slow, watch for hikers and cyclists, and overall be cautious.3. If you're heading to the summit for the views (Dobbins Lookout) bring a jacket or blanket. It's cold and windy when the sun goes down, even in the summer.There are bathrooms but no water fountains at the Lookout.
other Nice people, great food.  A really nice white linen place.  Loved the chicken karachi, naan, samosas, chicken pakora.  Wife had a lovely red, I had a nice premium margarita.
3 I feel like Top's has been getting angrier and more bitter over time.  I called on Fourth of July just to see if they were open and they guy on the other line told me, "Yeah and we're a madhouse.  Each minute I spend on the phone with you is another body out the door," and hung up on me.I wanted to call back and tell him, "You know, the amount of time that it took you to say that, you probably lost two bodies out there door.  You could have just said, 'Yes we are!' and that would have sufficed.  Instead, you had to be snarky so I'm calling you back specifically to waste your time."Instead, I'm just going to Yelp about it.On multiple occasions coming back over the past few months, I feel like I'm tip-toeing through the house when someone's mad at me.  I don't get it.  There's a serious vibe of negativity going on.  Specifically, the guy who acted like a fuckface over the phone has been snarky and bitchy a few times to me.  Oh, and refrigerate your fucking beer.  I'm tired of having to pop my shit in the freezer for 4other minutes cause the beer or champagne I buy is piss warm.
other This is the largest urban park. Moreover, that urban part is great because I am 10-30 minutes from three major trailhead areas. For hiking I like many points of entry, one of my favorites is telegraph pass, this is on the south side of the mountain. A new recently remolded parking lot is found on desert foothills parkway. There is a paved path that is about 1/other a mile and at its end Telegraph pass is to the left and Desert classic is to the right.Telegraph pass grows in steepness towards the top where there are some larger stairs. At the top, there is a bench and you can then continue on National trail. If you head west, you can reach a great Ramada.From the pima canyon entrance I take the fire road to national, after the initial ascent it is just some rolling hills, I then make left to hidden valley where there is a great natural tunnel, Follow this trail to reach fat man's pass, contrary to the name there is a narrow gap that fat men cannot pass luckily you can go around, this meets back up with national trail. Many unique rock formations on this hike. For shorter easier hikes from this lot, you can do the east and west loops and Beverly canyon all small trails that loop, and have a few nice views.For Mountain biking my skills are not too advanced so I stick to the east end of desert classic, with mostly straight section and a few wash passes and slight hill inclines it's great for a novice rider.
other Best pizza in the valley that I've had (I've yet to do Pizzaria Banco).  Great service, always made fast, and GREAT pricing...doens't travel well, so if you're gonna have it in your car for a while I wouldn't recommend it...I think that's why there's a lot of "soggy crust" comments etc...
other Great beer selecton, and the white pizza is delicious!  Good hang out spot wit sports on the big screen and board games/darts if that's your thing.  They also have a wide selection of exotic beer for sale.  This is a beer paradise!
other this place is amazing!  So many flavors to choose from!!!!  I LOVE this place!!!!
other http://stevelerer.comI traveled to Phoenix only a few days away from the LA marathon in March and was determined to start carbo loading early. My first stop was Matt's Big Breakfast, a place I had patroned back in 2010. That time I ordered the item that Guy tried on triple D and it was really good. He ordered the chop and the chick which was a pork chop and two fried eggs. It was delicious, with a great pesto topping, I only wished I could have had more pesto but they may have given it to me if I had asked.The restaurant is small usually with a 10 minute wait even for one person. I didn't mind and hung out with the locals for a little bit before I was able to sit at the bar. The decor and ambiance is not much different than most other small breakfast spots but it is clean and welcoming. The staff was nice and took my order quickly and it was only a short while before my order of the hog and the chick was in front of me. Placed at my spot of the counter was beautifully cooked think cut peppered bacon, crispy hashbrowns, and two perfectly cooked over medium eggs. Everything on the plate was cooked really well and was a perfect breakfast. The eggs were right under medium which is where I like them and the hashbrowns were crunchy and crispy on the outside while still creamy on the inside. Somewhat like a potato latke, just without all the onion. By far the star on the plate was the think cut bacon. Sometimes when a restaurant says that the bacon is think cut it really isn't and other times it is so thick that it comes out uncooked. Matt's got it just right and peppered right to the edge of too much. Just where I like it. I could have eaten platefuls of this stuff, if only they were in LA at the end of the marathon.The last thing in my order was the real reason I returned to Matt's. Each breakfast arrives with a side of bread of which you have a few options. Bread aside, the start was the strawberry jam they served on the side. The jam is without a doubt the best thing in the restaurant. It is super sweet with chunks of fruit inside. It has so much flavor in such a simple concoction, I could eat a jar of it. Too bad they only give you about two ounces. I wonder if they bottle and sell it because I would buy.All in all Matt's Big Breakfast is a really solid breakfast joint in downtown Phoenix. No wonder it always has a wait. The peppered bacon was delicious and the rest of the meal was nothing to scoff at but, in the end, I would come here every time I visit Phoenix just for the strawberry jam. Check out Matt's Big Breakfast the next time you are in town and let me know what you think.Overall Review: 7/10
other I had dinner here tonight, and loved the entire experience! The patio was roomy, our server was quick, and the food was delicious! I ordered the Thai Cobb salad and really enjoyed the unique, healthy flavor! My dinner was priced fairly and I got a lot of food. I will be going back
other Little Chicago Pizza is the best thin-crust pizza I think I've ever had. The restaurant is small, as they probably do most of their business carry-out or delivery.  We did eat in one time, and someone came right out from the kitchen to serve us, even filling our water cups from the soda fountain that was perfectly accessible for us to do ourselves.  Anywhere else I'd have expected a snotty "the water is right there" rather than real service.  Everybody is very friendly, even when on the phone taking orders.  Price is comparable to any other pizza spot around, but the pizza itself, if you like thin-crust, is just awesome.  Add in the great service and you have a solid pizza place for the south Scottsdale area.
other We've been here several times with our kids and grandkids.  It's a good family spot, but the service is just okay.  We love the fresh chips, and the wings are good.  Salads are 'meh'.  We'll come again because it's a good spot for the kids, but we'll come expecting not great service.
other I have eaten here twice now and this place is phenomenal!  Great price and amazing food.  I highly recommend the baked ziti!  I will go back at least twice a month.
3 I didn't go back again.  The haircut turned out to be worse than I thought, being quite unmanageable.  I ended up going back to the local Mexican barber, who charged 1other bucks for a pretty decent haircut.I think they gave better massages than they did haircuts.  Still, it wasn't a bad place, and one could do worse.
other Great place for brunch or to relax with a coffee. Their hot chocolate is amazing.
other John did a fantastic job on figuring out my overheating issue on my Infiniti after Grelichs failed to fix my car properly. John is more than fair with there pricing and are extremely knowledgeable. He has a customer for life from me.
other Well what can I say about this place?  The restaurant is located in an upscale commercial complex with boutiques and an AJ's in the middle of Arrowhead Ranch.  Definitely doesn't have the boring suburban feel which you get along Bell Road only a mile away.  The inside has exposed brick on the walls with sleek looking seating.  Each food item comes out looking like a self made creation from the chef.  I have to say the Marguerite pizza is one of my favorites.  Having a crispy crust and savory flavors that make my mouth want to eat more, more, and more.  But I don't need to eat more because I fill my mouth with a good wine.  I had  a Dutton Estate Chardonnay(I think) which was half off on this day which kept me happy.  This place did not fail me.So will I be back?  Umm that's a yes!
other I brought my sweet sister in law shopping at this Forever 2other location.  She had a bag full of goodies (several hundreds of dollars worth) from H&M.  She stopped at Forever 2other and  sat her bag on the ground right beside her while she tried on a pair of shoes.  Her H&M bag was stolen during that brief moment that the bag was not in her arms.....and while this certainly was not the responsibility of Forever 21....we were so disappointed in the way the Forever 2other staff reacted. They did not call security, or the police, or even offer any condolences.  They just shrugged their shoulders.  My sister in law did love some of the fashions at Forever 21....but the store was such a mess.  There were clothes all over the floor under each and every rack.  There were way too few staff members working, and many who were working were "socializing" with one another instead of helping customers or maintaining the store inventory in a decent fashion. The only employees that were on task were:  other at the checkout, and other at the fitting rooms - there was a band of other girls dressing one mannequin while the store was amidst in chaos (including someone stealing bags from other customers)..... So - if you choose to shop at this store - hold on to your bags :)
3 I think if you go to Wendy's you know what you are getting into and compared to some of the other Wendy's it's pretty good. I've gotten food poisoning at Wendy's in my home town, so when i tried this place in Phoenix it was pretty good and didn't make me sick. Granted, it's never going to be perfect, this is fast good not fine dining.  In my personal experiences, I've never had a problem, but i think it varies from person to person.
other Normally have had great service & food here, but on Father's Day, Nicole H was simply horrible.  Rude, slow, non-helpful, etc.  Just a total fail.  A different food-deliverer brought out food and "auctioned it off" (didn't know who got what), and I asked for a refill on my empty water glass, but he didn't bring it after 1other minutes, and Nicole didn't notice, so I had to bring it up to her.Their bloody Mary's taste just like tomato juice with tobasco.  Nothing special at all.  And for $12???!?!?!??!?!  SHAME.The coq au vin was great.WHY IS THERE NO "CONTACT US"/e-mail address ON THEIR WEBSITE?????
other There's something deliciously seventeen about drinking in "The Alley."  Of course, real seventeen year olds can't get in.  This place is legit, but the vibe is very Lloyd Dobler in a gas station parking lot asking a bunch of punk kids why he just can't win with women.  (Don't worry Lloyd none of us really have that figured out and most of us who seem to be doing it successfully are really just faking it.)The crowd here varies but I have always felt welcome.  Drinks are ok.  Sometimes they're great but it depends on who's tending bar.  The good thing is they're fairly cheap.  As a music venue I give it  high five.  It's dirty and dark with a one foot high stage that's obviously meant for performance but not so far removed as to make you feel like you're not connected to what's going on.  The sound is ok.  It depends on the show really but I've always had a good time and that counts for a lot.I like the pictures on the ceiling. They're fun to try to decipher when you're setting yourself on spin cycle.  The pool tables are usually full so I can't really vouch for them other than to say that they're popular.  All in all, it's a decent place to pummel yourself in the face with your beverage of choice.
other As a frequent antiques consumer, I can honestly say that Lizabel's Treasures is my favorite antique store in Phoenix. I've been a customer for several years, and Lizabel's is my first (and often only) stop.Why Lizabel's is such a treasure is because of these things: price, desirable antiques, and great customer service. John and Bette know what people want, and they go to great lengths to get the antiques that people want and to make their customers happy. I'm a believer.They consistently have one-of-a-kind quality furniture and pieces that you would not normally find elsewhere in town. Pieces are priced very agreeably, so you can afford to stock up or furnish a whole room without busting the bank.John and Bette have created the kind of family business that is to be admired. They have a legion of supportive customers, and I'm one of them. I can always find them to be helpful and interested in getting me what I want, even if I don't always know what I want.Lisabel's Treasures is the place to build a relationship with, because as one's life's needs changes, so does the need for different pieces and furniture. I can always count on finding something I really love at their store, and you will, too.
3 On a recent Sunday night I was kickin it at the Vine, sharing a well-priced pitcher of imported beer with a friend, and taking in the scene. The place looked as though it was in the midst of some sort of remodeling project, but now upon sober reflection, my guess is that it just always looks like that. Night went like this: An order of spudskins from the bar-food menu? Sure! Hmmm- they're kinda dry and cardboardy, but looky there! They've smothered them in baco bits, so I'll bite...Hey- check it out! A guy's setting up karaoke! This might be fun. Oh oh- it's not karaoke, he's got a guitar. OK he's ready to sing. He looks like his name is "Eric". He's standing at the mic with his guitar waiting for the bartender to turn down the jukebox. People are pleading with the bartender to leave the jukebox on because "I still haven't heard my Modest Mouse!" and "I still have other more songs coming!" The bartender relents and leaves the jukebox on. Eric goes outside for a smoke. Maybe a drink at the bar. Modest Mouse plays. He gets back on stage and waits. And waits. Finally the jukebox is lowered and Eric starts to play and sing his original songs from the heart. I miss Modest Mouse. Eric sucks. Nowonder the bartender was so slow to turn off the jukebox. We're out of here! Bye!!
other Who's got the munchies!!!!! Friday and Saturday nights till 3 am, Mrs. White's is servin' up some yummy munchies including Fried Zucchini around $3 and entrees for $13.  I had to have their fried chicken , pork chop and some gravy and rice at 12am! The fried chicken was cooked perfectly.  The skin is crispy and tasty.  The meat moist and tasty.  The portions are huge and you will not go home hungry.  The staff is friendly and helpful; always a pleasure to talk to them.  Skip Filibertos or Jack n' Box after the party..movie..concert..and go to Mrs. White's!
3 I went to this place on a friend's recommendation, but have only eaten the custard. The lemon is quite refreshing and fluffy although I wish is was a little less sweet. This is a great place to visit after a light meal in downtown Mesa if you are looking to satisfy your sweet tooth, but not go overboard. The service is fantastic and the parking is ample as they have a private lot. The inside of the restaurant is quite charming and diner like. If you are really looking for the full experience of frozen custard, eat it outside in the never-ending, relentless Arizona sun...you will truly feel the refreshment!
other To sum it up, this place was just not the place for me. Maybe I am just a fuddy duddy, but it seems that the clientele are cougar-like women, aged 30-50, with bleached hair and sequin tops. I expected a quiet wine bar, but instead it is more like a loud night club.The hubby and I visited The Living Room on a Saturday night, so maybe the whole "we-wish-we-were-a-club" thing was just a once a week occurrence, and maybe, just maybe, I am totally un-cool, but we don't plan to return.Food: Wine specials were fairly decent and priced well. Food was average (3 stars). We had a variety of bruschetta, a tuna salad and a strawberry salad - way too much dressing on both salads. Service: It took a long time to get a table (~30 mins), but it was Saturday night and crowded, so expected. Once seated, our waitress seemed more concerned with anything other than serving us. She was not very attentive at all. She asked for my order and walked away. My husband was like "uh, I kind of want to order too"Atmosphere: The overall look and feel of the place is pretty neat. It is a smaller restaurant with lots of patio/outdoor seating. Decor is large heavy curtains and many couches, thus the name The Living Room. However, as I mentioned earlier, the music was ridiculously loud. They had a DJ playing music so loud, having a conversation was impossible (and we ended up sitting pretty far from the speakers!). We left a soon as we finished our dinners (didn't stay for more wine or dessert) because the music was just too annoying.
other Marcellino and Sima are finally back after their yearly other month Italy vacation (re-opened September 10th)....and are we glad they are back!  We had a fabulous duo appetizer: fresh fig and prosciutto and the second was a filet (carpaccio) with shaved mushroom and black truffle!  Delicious!  I've always been a fan of prosciutto and melon, but the fresh fig was tremendous!Marcellino also brought us a fresh black truffle cream for his crusty bread, mmmm, amazing.  I don't think you can get this anywhere (fresh), even here if you ask for it, but we were lucky to be in the right place at the right time!Pasta duo was tortellini with even more truffles and a wild boar pappardelle.  Best hand made pastas anywhere.  Perfect!Main course was a perfectly cooked filet with his mashed potatoes and julienned vegetables...and more truffles!  So right...so full!  I'm so glad we had an hour spinning class before embarking on this journey!We ended up skipping desert and had some left over to go!  What a perfect Italian dinner paradise!We can't wait to go back for opera night...and of course we are waiting for his next wine dinner.  Best in the valley.
other I don't have much time to write this, but I do want to say a few things. I had four things so far here. My friend and I both enjoyed them immensely. I paid $16 + tip. I had the [Aother - Cha Gio - crispy egg rolls ] & [Aother - Goi Cuon Thit Tom - spring rolls] to start.Oh man was this delicious. The first thing I loved when I walked in was the ambiance. Dim lit and let the sun do the lighting - very zen - if you're into that. I felt very comfortable here.They had four sauces on the table. I have no idea what they are, but the one with red pepper flakes and oil -- the darker one -- oh wow. If you like heat added to whatever you're doing -- wow -- this stuff is for you! I loved it. Then I went with the Pho tai - sirloin soup. [P2* - Pho tai] - wow - broth was amazing. Everything was. For me, enjoying food means I need a few things. First - awesome foodSecond - ambianceThird - presentationThey had it all. I was very impressed by place to the plates. Don't change a thing. I hope  your business is very prosperous!
other I'm usually not a big buffet fan, but this place changed my mind!  It's very clean, good service, lots and lots of amazing dishes, AND really good sushi!  Weekend lunch was $14.99, but during the week it's $11.99. Well worth every penny. One more comment, this isn't the kind of buffet where "shifty people" go. The kind where you need to Purell your hands and arms when you get back to the table : )
other I am a vegetarian and there is a ton of great stuff at Pita Jungle. I just had the hummus trio, babaganoush, dolmas, mozzarella, and feta for appetizers tonight. Fantastic happy hour on the apps and delicious. Took BLACK BEAN BURGER to go. SOOOO good! Also, servers are super nice and prompt. YAY!
other This charming little place not only has the BEST custom spray tan around - they can also whiten your teeth and have a rotating selection of adorable summer dresses on the cheap! If you are sick of being orange or baking under the harmful uv rays check this place out! First time clients get a discount! I will never go anywhere else!
other I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in and saw that Country Market had a deli here. I picked up a roast beef sandwich and some potato salad. When I was eating it my friend said it sounded like I was having a mouth orgasm because I moaned after every bite! If  you live in the area and haven't been here yet try the sandwiches they're great.
other I've been to China Magic Noodle many times over the years; it's one of my husband's favorite places to eat. The employees are friendly and prompt to provide service.I always get #3other (Beef, Noodles, w/XO sauce) or the #27 (Seafood Noodle Soup) and love both. The noodles plates are big; unless you are a big eater, expect to take some home. The mango smoothie w/boba is also delicious; you can taste the fruit and know it's fresh.I agree w/some of the other reviewers regarding the smell - this place definitely has a "smell" to it, who knows what it is - but it's not a disgusting/offensive smell. Overall the place is clean, the service is good, and the food is great!
other La Grande Orange Grocery has a problem. It can't decide what it wants to be when it grows up, and that makes the overall experience iffy. Is it a quick mart? A grocery store? A restaurant? A coffee shop? Unfortunately, it can't be all of them.I love La Grande Orange Pizzeria, when there is table service, fun wait-staff, and delicious food. But during the day on the weekends, the Grocery is too busy and unorganized to tolerate. It is not set up for the crowd, they do a poor job of line management, and when there is a line to order, the rest of the Grocery is impossible to navigate. To top it off, the counter staff shouts at you when your food is ready. Unnecessary.I'll certainly be back at night for the pizza, the delicious wings, and to partake of the best gelato shop adjacent to LGO. But I'm afraid that I won't be back for the weekend chaos.
3 I have to say i avoid this store as much as i can. I have lived in this same neighborhood for 1other years,so i have had to go to this store many times over the years. They just never understand Customer service at this location.  It is very close to where i live but, i would rather drive a little further for fresh and Easy. However, i this night i thought i would just stop here for a quick shopping experience.                                                           My boyfriend was really sick and i wanted to take him some fresh Chicken soup that they make and sell here. So here i am at 6:4other at night on a weekday. One cashier is open ,yes only one in a store that size!!!   Mind you the store is packed.  The line is all the way down the frozen food isle.   There are other registers where you can check your self out / But, no one is there to help them( all other busy)..    And it is winter in molasasville. So slow. I am sorry and don't want to sound like i am above it all,but i do not have time to waste like this.                                                                         This is not a one time  experience either. This is one of the biggest reasons i hate going to this store. I have been to other Safeways around the valley that are not like this.   The one on 7th Street for instance. They never behave this way.   Sorry to say i will continue to avoid this shop!!
other My wife and I originally went last Sunday only to find it closed. But since I had a Groupon deal I purchased last month, we went back Wednesday night to cash it in. And we're so glad we did. Kind of hidden in a shopping mall with movie theaters upstairs, we were quickly seated and served our drinks with chips and salsa. My wife ordered the fish tacos (2) with rice and black beans. Tacos and rice were both good. Black beans so-so. I ordered the Cuban sliders. 3 mini sandwiches w/ham, cheese, and a Cuban seasoned beef - oh so good - with a side of sweet potato fries. Wasn't a fan before. But now I am. Fries were hot and crunchy. I could only put down other and took other back to our hotel for breakfast Thursday. Would definitely return for another meal when in PHX again.
3 Food was good but I can't say I was terribly impressed overall.  The food kind of took a ridiculously long time even when only one other table was in the restaurant.  The appetizers came out fifteen minutes after our main meals - we had figured they forgot about it.Tastewise, things were decent but not quite memorable.  I had a chicken shawarma and the whole ordeal was filling but a bit on the bland side.
other I`ve had work done by this shop a few times thruoghout the past few years. My latest experience was when my sons car broke its timing belt and needed substantial repairs. Bob informed us that he could move the car out of the way in his lot to be safely stored until we decided whether we wanted to fix it or not. This is just one of the reasons why I`ll always bring my business to him.
other Refused to give water to young teen & referred her to PF Changs.  Olive & Ivy handled this poorly, unprofessionally & pathetically. PF Changs didn't even hesitate to give her the water.  That's why I ate there instead.
other I really dig this place!  But I have to say, every 3rd or 4th visit to this restraunt is a miss.  Not sure why- but it is most of the time spot on.  I love the Pho- but the noodle dishes are what is off.  Either way, the owners are super sweet and nice and it usually is never too busy.  Service is good, carry out is great as well.  Just be careful in the noodle dish category, becuase if your really hungry, (in my experience) it may miss the mark.  Order pho to be safe!
other Some of the food here is fantastic such as the Chicken Corfu $14.9other and others like the Gyro I found to be less than good becasue the meat was very dry some parts burnt with the obviously strong taste of fish.  I sent it back and they took it off our bill.  The remainder of the meal which consisted of the Corfu, salads and soup was great and our waitress; the owners daughter promised to address the Gyro with the kitchen.  This restaurant is located at the park in Fountain Hills with unobstructed views of the lake and fountain which erupts every hour spraying water more than 500 feet in the air.  We took a nice walk in the park after dinner which was very relaxing.  Recommended
other I booked this resort through Priceline like so many other reviewers. I had seen this resort from Scottsdale road many times and always thought I would like to stay there sometime. Now I am so glad I finally got the chance. We stayed for other nights over memorial day weekend. Upon check in I was asked if I would like to up grade to a king suite for $20 more a night. I said sounds good to me. I figured it couldn't hurt for as cheep as I got the room through Priceline. I cant say enough about how well we were treated at this resort. Some of the other reviews said that this resort didn't have a resort feel. In my experience nothing could be further from the truth. I was treated better here than I have been at many other star resorts that I have stayed at in the past. Our suite was part of a other plex of suites and while the decor was a little dated it was very plush and comfortable in every way from the couches to the king size bed. The bathroom was very clean as was the entire room. The ground around the entire resort were impeccable. There are either other or other pools through out the resort and the main pool has a small waterfall. The jacuzzi tubs were all very warm and in working order. We didn't order room service but I did browse through the menu and the prices were really reasonable. Everyone we met that worked at the resort was extremely friendly with the exception of one bartender at the poolside cabana bar. Overall I would have rated the entire experience with other stars the reason I gave it only other stars is because of our experience at the poolside cabana. On Saturday afternoon we walked down to the poolside bar area to have a drink and we sat at a table near the bar. We were ignored by the bartender for over 1other minutes while he talked to some young girl in a bikini who was already done getting her drinks. When we were finally acknowledged we asked him if he knew how to make a certain drink he quickly replied no what else do you want in a very rude manner. We each ordered some Orange drink that was on special and it was terrible. So I am taking a half star for that experience and a half star for the extremely high price of wi-fi. It would have cost nearly $13.00 a day so we decided to pass. Thank God for our smart phones. Overall we really loved our weekend at this resort and would definitely return  especially for the great price we got through Priceline although I never did get a chance to see a regular room and I wonder if our experience would have been as good if we hadn't upgraded to the suite.
other In 'n' Out, I don't know how to tell you this, but . . . I've found someone else.  No, no, it's not like that, it was nothing you did!  Your burgers with their fresh toppings are delicious... but sometimes I just need a little change of pace, maybe something with grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, and bacon... mmm... bacon.  Oh, sorry.  You want to know the name?  I don't see why that...  You insist?  Okay... it's Five Guys.Oh!  You're upset!  YOU'RE upset!  Well let me tell you what - Five Guys' fries are delicious, whether they come in Cajun OR regular!  And I NEVER liked your fries, In 'n' Out!  I just pretended to like them, but they're skinny, kind of limp, never flavorful, and you don't get very many.  Five Guys cuts 'em thick, salts them up, and pours an extra scoop into the bag, how do you like that!  And they give you FREE peanuts to munch on while you wait.  You never give me anything!What?  No... you're right, Five Guys is a more expensive taste.  That's true, it is over $10 for a burger, fries, and drink, as opposed to your $5.  And I do have to park in a garage that loosely resembles a labyrinth designed by Escher.  But if you eventually make it up to the restaurant, they VALIDATE.  You have NEVER validated me!  Oh, that's right, you have surface parking, but don't try to pretend that's a feature with the temperature hitting 100!  You're ridiculous.What's that?  Does Five Guys have milkshakes?  Uh... hm.  Milkshakes.  I never thought about that.  They don't.  Would you mind if I got my burger and fries from there and then came to you for the shake?  No?  Fine.  You're so overprotective and hyper-traditional sometimes.  Live a little.I hope we can still be friends, In 'n' Out, but I just think I need to see other burgers.  Please don't pelt me with limp fries when I turn my back.
other Christy is an amazing cake artist.  She has an impressive portfolio as she has a flair for creativity.  Her cakes are amazing and are truly one-of-a-kind.  She also has several delicious cake flavors to choose from or she can create one for you.   She has made several cakes for our family and I have been impressed with everyone of them.  I was also excited to see her compete on TLC's Ultimate Cake Off show early this spring.  If you're looking for a sculpted cake or one that will be the center of attention at your next party, then I recommend you call Phoenix Cake Company.
other Citizen Public House is a great addition to the Old Town dining scene. I love seeing restaurants crop up in that part of town that aren't just catering to the bar scene and making the food an afterthought. My girlfriend and I made reservations for Friday night expecting Bernie Kantak's new restaurant to be packed. Much to our surprise when we arrived, the place was pretty dead with tons of open tables. We purposely arrived early to enjoy a cocktail at the bar and even though we could have been seated right away, we pressed forward with our original plan.At the bar, I ordered my usual cocktail while the GF ordered a sangria off their cocktail menu. We also ordered an order of the bacon fat heirloom popcorn from the bar snacks menu. My cocktail was perfectly made and my GF loved the sangria. The popcorn took forever to come out, but when it was delivered they also brought out an order of the calamari compliments of the chef. The popcorn was a little bit burned and we both thought it could have used some salt, which was surprising since we thought the bacon fat would have provided that flavor. The calamari was perfectly cooked and not greasy in the least. I enjoyed the pickled fennel on the side, but my GF isn't a fan of fennel, so she didn't try it.After we finished our cocktails at the bar, we moved to a table for the main event. In an unusual move for us, we skipped wine and stuck with beer and cocktails, but I did eye some good finds on the concise wine list. For our appetizer, we ordered the sausage of the day, which was a beef based sausage with a cabbage casing. It was very unique and we both really enjoyed it. For our main courses, the GF ordered the AZ B.L.T. and ordered the Pork Tender Loin. The B.L.T. had tons of perfectly crispy bacon on it, but we both agreed that it was really good , but not great overall. The Pork Tender Loin, on the other hand, was excellent in my opinion. I loved the figs and the sweet potato-chevre strudel. Of course, you could put chevre on anything and I would like it.When it was time for dessert, we knew that we had to try some of Tracy Dempsey's latest creations. We normally split dessert, but decided to each get our own. The GF got the cookies and milk and I had the chocolate toffee bread pudding. The cookies are delivered in a bag that you can take home, which is great because you probably won't down the generous serving of cookies in one setting  unless you're sharing. My GF was quite happy to take home a little bag of cookies to enjoy later. My bread pudding was awesome and I wish I could have purchased a gallon of the Maker's Mark ice cream to take home with me. I'll definitely be craving this dessert in the future.The atmosphere of the restaurant is a little austere, even for my taste. It just seems like they could a little bit to make it a little bit more warm and inviting. Service, while extremely friendly, was a little bit uneven throughout the night starting with the snacks at the bar taking a long time and continuing with confusion over what tables plates should be delivered to. Keep in mind the restaurant has been open for only a week, so these are things that can be worked out.We were really surprised to see the restaurant so empty on a Friday night, so I hope more people give it a try. Citizen is a really good neighborhood restaurant that has the potential to be great. We look forward to trying it again to see how it improves and evolves. I'm really hoping it's a successful staple in Old Town for years to come.
other Great food and a fun atmosphere! service is a little slow, but the food is always delicious!
other This place was real chill last night. I had been to the one in Downtown Phoenix quite a few times before and wasn't all to impressed, but this location is a whole 'nother animal.Plenty of space to do you.Something so rare in cramped up tiny Scottsdale. Crowd was alright and the bartenders we're super nice. Might have to swing through the next time I hit up Scottsdale.
other Ordered the King Carlos IV.  It was HUGE, two of us ate half of it.  I thought it would be smaller than that.  It had all the major meats plus hotdogs, cheeses, and a siracha type sauce.  I think this was featured in diners, drive-ins, and dives.  It was very good but just wow huge.  It came with a side of ruffled chips.  Very nice people.  The fruit smoothies were good the horchata decent but not the best I've had.  Great bang for your buck though.  I'd go again and try something a bit more sensibly sized.There was a wait of about 1other minutes or so.  Very popular on a Saturday for lunch :)
other Andrea is absolutely wonderful. She's pet-sit for me several times over the past several years and I've never had a single issue. On her first visit she stopped by to meet the animals and go over details with me. Now I just call her to let her know the days I'll be away and she arrives without any problems. She's very responsible and trustworthy - her copy of my house key broke off in the lock and she called me right away and we figured out a solution. She even came by on a day she didn't have to in order to get it fixed - all of this while I was gone.  On another occasion my travel plans changed suddenly and she was able to continue watching my animals. I highly recommend Andrea as a professional house-sitter. She can't be beat.
3 Valle Luna bats .250.  Not high enough to put in the middle of the lineup (hell, probably not enough to even start), not low enough to send back down to AAA.  Completely average.  I'll admit, however, to frequenting the restaurant primarily for its bar which seemingly promotes about 17,696 drink specials and more on football sundays.  Other than that, there isn't really a whole lot to say one way or another.  Perhaps that says more than a lengthy review ever could...
other Our second experience here was much better. We knew to stay away from the traditional fattier foods and stuck with healthier options. We had: - Mussels appetizer - Stuffed mushrooms appetizer - Chicken flatbread - Salmon - ScallopsEverything had quite a bit of flavor and was prepared well. We would return again!
other This place is great! Just opened up on central just south of camelback on the west side of the road. ...AMAZING gelato and the coffee is just what I need! Family owned, really friendly staff, free wifi, flat screen tvs,....also just saw a flier for a monday movie night...I guess they are gonna have double features on mondays...even made a specialty drink for the night....sounds like fun!...cool little spot, dont hesitate to check this place out!
3 So, I'll admit that I'm a ***bertos addict...I truly crave this food and I'm not really sure why.  My mom says that she ate nachos w/ jalepenos on a regular basis while pregnant with me.  Maybe that explains it.  Anyway, I've been wanting to try this place forever since they claim to have "the best tortillas in town."  I seized the opportunity to check it out since I had to drop a friend off at the airport this morning.   The exterior certainly leaves a lot to be desired, and the ambiance is about on par with the drunk tank at the fourth avenue jail (a good friend spent a most unfortunate night here and described it in detail).  The cold, stained cement floors, nasty old booths and 70's McDonald's style swivel plastic chairs which likely  needed a new coat of paint back in the early 80's.  I decided on a green chile burrito and my companion ordered the egg/chorizo/potato/cheese burrito.  After waiting for about 5-10 minutes, our number was called.  The first thing I noticed was that the burritos were quite small.   I knew, however, that I was in for a real treat with the piping hot, super chewy freshly made tortilla, and I was not disappointed.  The green chile, while tasty, had too much liquid and after inadvertantly puncturing my tortilla, I was left with a handful of sauce.  I certainly felt more than safe inside this place (despite the somewhat scary clientele) based on the table of twelve Phoenix police officers sitting across from us.  Overall, I would give the atmosphere 1.other stars, and the food 3.7other stars.   It was definitely different than what I'm used to, and it gave me a small taste of the cultural melting pot known as South Phoenix.
other Decent farmers market with several friendly vendors.Look for the jalopeno peanut brittle, the incredible maccaroons, sweet republic ice cream and crepes from torched goodness! lots of yumminess and it is dog-friendly!
other This is by far the best and most authentic Mexican food I've had in this area of town. I try and get different dishes each time I visit and have yet to be disappointed. If you're looking for an amazing location/view/atmosphere, this probably isn't the place for you. If you're looking for amazing food, then you've come to the right place. The prices are great for what you get. The quesadillas are served on a pizza tray so bring your appetite!
other I'm not a big drinker, but this place is pretty sweet if you are. Huge selection at excellent prices.
3 The pizza here is average. It's not bad, but it's not the best pizza I've ever had, either. Was it worth $9.7other for a 12" personal pizza? No. I paid with a Fox Restaurants gift card, so I can't complain too much about a "free for me" meal. I would probably not come back again if it was on my dime. Also, my pizza was a little bit burnt on the crust. It was edible, but I was surprised that they served me slightly burnt pizza at the price of $9.75. My fiance's wasn't-- in fact, they remade his entire pizza and didn't even send it out to us because it had a hole in the crust.
other lululemon is the best clothing store to hit Scottsdale since Ross. Even though exercise shorts there cost more than an evening in Tijuana they are worth every penny. So what if the pants there cost $160? They are awesome. Would Batman ever question Alfred about how much he paid for the Batmobile? No. Because the Batmobile is awesome and Batman would have paid any price for it. The men's side of the store doesn't carry a wide collection but what I did find was more magical than the sorting hat at Hogwarts. Everything is so comfortable and if you're overweight most of the pants and shorts have elastic so you don't look like a muffin when you put them on. I also like the workers there too. They are friendly and helpful and helped me understand that even if I liked some of the women's shirts there it would not be a good idea for me to purchase one and wear it. But I love teal I cried! If you haven't been to lululemon that probably means you hate small animals.
other All I can say is DELICIOUS!!!  Service was great, food was great ,and the restaurant looks beautiful.
other My wife and I finally tried CPH and were greatly surprised by everything.  The food, as expected, was superior along with the professionalism of the staff.  The ambiance too was well set as the place could hold large parties very comfortably.  We began the nigth with a bottle of wine, the original chopped salad alons with the rock shrimp.  All were exceptional!  As out main courses, my wife orded the sea scallops and I ordered the short ribs.  (Peter of Cowboy Ciao's must miss this guy.)  Both dinners were cooked to perfection and the staff never left alone.  For dessert, we had coffee and the evening's special, the donut holes with three dipping sauces.  All were fantastic.  The wife and I don't usually rate places with five stars, but this place actually gets how food and service are meant to be as one.  Can't wait until we head back.
other Most of my excitement and "love" of this place has more to do with what it represents -- not what it is right at this second, but I fully expect that to get better. TFM representing a place in Central Tempe to get basic groceries (all the better that they're local and organic!) without needing access to a car. When I looked up the location, I felt heartsick at the thought that this is right across the street from where the Co-Op used to be. What's there now? An empty dirt lot. The Co-Op was driven out by an over zealous real estate company that, in the boom of condo building, bought the location, driving Co-Op to another spot where it eventually failed. Know what else failed? That condo endeavor. Now, a few years later, we have this budding marketplace with a lot to live up to.My first trip in, I didn't have anything particular I needed, I just wanted to check things out (though I was making enchiladas later that day, so had a few items I was on the look-out for). It's pretty small right now, and in the former building of Jake's Shop, which is also another Tempe staple now gone. But it had the basics such as milk, peanut butter, a small selection of produce -- local, of course -- cheese and even some gift-type items for sale in the back. I picked up some green onions (99 cents for a bunch) and red peppers ($1.29/ea), and thought those prices were exact with a chain grocery. And bread - this is my favorite part of the store! A big selection of sliced wheats and grains, and rolls and longer Ciabatta styles too. And the favorite of my favorite? Fresh "Made this morning!" tortillas! They looked delicious, and were HUGE. The size of a large pizza, they came in flavored varieties for making yummy wraps.When I checked out ($other minimum for credit card purchases, and a sign said "EBT coming soon"), I was offered another red pepper from a basket by the register because this small batch was about to go bad. So instead of letting them and then throwing them away, they *give* them away with each purchase - wonderful! Oh, and I was surprised and pleased to see a small corner of the store set up with a couple small tables and a couch, all within view of a large flat screen playing Alice in Wonderland. Sure enough, a kid sat there, out of the way and quiet, while is parents shopped. Both parents and the childless thank the owners for THAT kid haven, I'm sure.I really look forward to coming in again and again and watching this place grow and thrive.p.s. I highly recommend becoming a fan of their FB page, so you can get daily info about what they just got in, specials, new additions, etc.
3 The food was excellent ... the service not so much. A colleague and I took one of my clients here for a business dinner. The atmosphere was great, the food was outstanding but the service was embarrassing. It was a fun, Arizona type feeling restaurant and made quite the difference for my clients who are originally from Scotland. I had the roasted shrimp and grits. The grits were the best I have ever had (sorry North Carolina!). The shrimp portion was amazing. The dessert was great. I was surprised to see the offering of huckleberries. Sadly, the server forgot quite a bit of things. My client's wife ordered a second glass of wine to have for dinner, which was forgotten. We also asked for corn bread - the server forgot and brought it with our dessert. He tried to explain that it is made fresh to order and that is why it took so long.
3 We had fun but it is definately more for kids other and younger . The pretend store was fun and we all had a blast playing in the noodles.
other If you are staying in Phoenix for any length of time, this is a must stop for at least a cocktail.  From walking through the kitchen, to being seated promptly in a booth, this is quintessential gastronomic delight.  Durant's is an icon and legend. Period.  Wine list is great, have a well-versed sommelier also.  I never order Filet, but when in Rome...
other I realize L&L is a chain, but I love their food. My favorites are the Loco Moco and the BBQ Chicken. I also enjoy their haupia-filled donuts. The family that runs this place is very friendly and do a great job in making sure you will enjoy your meal. Go there.
other Love this place.  Great selection of beers, cheap ($3 per beer) happy hour, relaxed atmosphere and walking distance to the Light Rail.  Some nights they have live music which isn't always to my taste but I like that they provide a venue for local artists and musicians on top of everything else.  On First Fridays it's packed (so good or bad depending on your feeling about crowds - I avoid it those nights) but on other nights ... it's just a very cool and comfortable place to hang out.  Sometimes parking is kind of hard to find.
other Great fried fish and crispy onion rings....yum!
other This place was just... okay. First I'd like to say that my bridal consultant (don't remember her name - sorry) was really nice and helpful. But to me most of the other saleswomen had "desperation" all over their faces (don't know if they work off of commission, or if the higher ups are just slave laborers, or what, but I'm sure some of them would've killed for a sale). I found a few dresses I liked, but they were way too high pressure for me to be able to make a solid decision on the spot, so I decided to wait on it. I ended up finding a dress I liked better for about 1/3 of the price somewhere else. I notified David's Bridal "thanks but no thanks" about 6 months ago. To this day I still get calls to my cell phone asking me to "come back in and try on the dress"... they're like the telemarketers of the bridal world! So annoying. Plus their accessories are so expensive, and very cookie cutter. I'd go somewhere else, unless you're new to this and need some ideas.
other Burger was great, but the service wasn't so great. When thumbing through my wallet for cash, the owner rudely interrupted me and told me they don't accept cards, only cash payment. When my friend asked what he would recommend, he shoved a menu in his face and said "I'd recommend looking at a menu". I fought back the urge to just leave and go somewhere else and ordered  the Good Ass burger, which was avocado and bacon, so you can't really go wrong with that. The fries were good and the burger was pretty good. Service: other starFood: other starsAverage: other starshttp://dietstartstomorrow.com/post/2983024079/two-hippies-magic-mushroom-burgers-phoenix
other Great movie theater----staff so friendly!!!    If you love movies and comfy, clean theaters at reasonable price, check it out!!!!    Parking so easy and close as well.
other Strolled in with a posse of 1other people for a birthday party. The staff was accommodating in getting everyone seated and served with drinks, especially as people funneled on in throughout the night.  The place isn't huge, it can really only accommodate one large party at a time.First off, if you are a vegetarian or Muslim, be aware that you are going to an authentic italian restaurant - meaning that 75% of their menu items will have sausage/ham/salami/etc. Being cognizant of that, it was a smart idea to peak at the menu before arriving. We got the Vegetariana Pizza ($14), which came with Mozzarella, Provolone, Caramelized Onions, Roasted Peppers, and Parmigiano Reggiano. I thought it tasted great, it was crispy, thin-crust and had plenty of cheesy to it. I thought it was an above average pizza, but nothing that would have impressed Emeril.In addition to the pizza, we split the Spiedini al Forno ($16), which was Marinated Beef Tenderloin in a Shish Kabob style with Onions, Bell Peppers & Tomato. The waitress advised us in ordering the beef "medium" and no higher because it may get too dry or overcooked. I don't usually do medium, but she advised us correctly. It came out with only a little bit of redness and packed a good flavor. The onions, bell peppers and tomato are Kim Kardashian, meaning that they are all show and no substance. I didn't think they added anything to the entree and in fact, I didn't even eat them - which is rare for me to pass up on food. It wasn't like I was full, they just tasted bland.For dessert, they brought the birthday boy a Dolce Della Casa ($12), which is a slightly charred sweet calzone filled with chocolate hazelnut sauce and topped with bananas and vanilla ice cream. Everyone shared and It hit the spot. However, once the ice cream runs out, you're outta luck. The dessert is really complemented with the sweetness and coldness of the vanilla ice cream. The environment was kinda noisy (probably because we were a group of 14), and the wait staff was kinda slow (once again, because there were 1other of us), but they had a TV playing the knicks game so I was happy being able to watch LINSANITY, and the woodfire oven was blazing away for some good ambience. Overall, this place would be much better for a date or small group gatherings, otherwise you may be waiting for your food too long or feel a little crowded. Oh and just beware, the bill can become a little pricey if you aren't splitting entrees....
other It hurts me to say this, fue to the fact that I love local businesses in my hood and I fully support them, but here is another restaurant that I wish would have been better...Good news...More restaurants opening in Downtown, more options especially late night options...Bad news...More restaurants opening in Downtown wanting to make a quick buck but does not deliver on food and quality...I came here with a couple of friends really excited to try the only sushi restaurant in DT open for dinner.  There has been some good review on the place and I wanted to give it a chance...I should have gone north to Hana or Yasu!Walking in, I noticed the decor was another warehouse looking restaurant trying to be modern...only thing is , its not.  From the neon lights under bar to the wood paneling to the tin like tables, chairs, and barstools...its been done 30 times over.  I wish it had more character, a little bit more distinctive.  We are in the art district.  I don't want to walk in a restaurant that looks similar to ones that are already open in the same area?  Okay enough with that, the artist in me is rambling again..sorry..back to the "food" review.Food:  The menu to me was a little confusing.  For being a Sushi joint, it had so many other things also, mostly stirfry items.  I decided to stick to what I came here to try, sushi.  I ordered squid salad to start.  I should not have ordered that to start.  The salad was so salty and it was drowning in dressing...bad start...I then ordered some sashimi including saba, sweet shrimp, and of course my favorite toro.  I was a little disappointed that they did not have uni..how can you not have uni! Saba...not bad...Sweet Shrimp....foul tastingToro.....couldn't even bite through itA good sushi joint has to have fresh fish...good sushi needs to be executed by a sushi chef with good knife skills...simple as that..When your fish is not that fresh and your sushi chef fish slicing techniques are not there, you have a losing combo.My friend out of frustration had the head chef make us something...He brought out the geisha roll.Spicy tuna is not my thing but out of courtesy, we did ask him to pick, I tried it..it was ok, again I am not too keen on chopped up tuna, which in this case tasted like it was food processed.  A little too mushy..Drinks:Beers: Been done.  Infused vodkas: Been done Cocktails: Been done.Good Points:  Nice staff, cool Teapots, and clean restroomsAll in all, I guess I was hoping for a sushi joint that was more innovative and creative with equally good skills to execute.  Maybe I am too harsh.  Or maybe I am just saying it how it is...As I left the joint, I felt like I have been to a sushi restaurant like that so many times before...Hopefully they will succeed with less critical customers unlike myself..best of luck!!
other I love the owners.  Very friendly and accomodating.  One night we had called after they had closed, and were pleasantly surprised when someone answered.  Turns out they were hosting a private party.  They agreed to take our order, which made us pretty happy.I adore their Greek fries.  Olive oil, lemon, and the perfect amount of fetta.  Been here several times for lunch, and always leave happy.  Looking forward to meeting friends here for happy hour.
other Great atmosphere with interesting lights (look like white jellyfish). Got a Chicken piccata which was delicious. TVs were conveniently placed so we were able to watch the World Series Games. Overall, a fun place to catch up with friends.
other I was working for a non-profit organization and Amare was actually there. He was gracious enough to take a few pictures with some of our children who are clients, which was nice of him. But, as far as the food goes - it's bland. I've been here on two separate occassions other than work, and while the atmosphere is beautiful (the seats and booths are roomy and comfy and there are even more seats that stretches out to the back, leading to a small "VIP" section), the food is just not that great.
other Stayed for a few days. Was not impressed. I prefer Marriott, but was not available. The room was clean and check in was good. The pool and fitness center sucked. I had dinner in the restaurant, a hamburger. It was good. Over all downtown Phoenix sucks, nothing to do after 6PM.
3 Cave Creek is a well-manicured muni, featuring a straight-forward layout, nice practice area and large putting green.  There are some elevation changes and some bunkering that add some challenge, but overall it's a pretty easy course.Some of the better holes are #5, a dogleg right with no room to drive it left (slopes into a hazard), and large green with some tricky pin positions if the flag is in the back.  #8 is a long par four with a narrow driving area and a challenging approach featuring a narrow chute to the green that will most likely need to be hit with a mid-to-long iron (#other handicap).  #1other is a par other that forces you consider fairway metal off the tee, as a driver hit over 260 yds and to the right could likely find a water hazard, and anything left is completely dead.  My personal favorite hole is #18, a short four par with a carry over a ravine from the tee to an uphill, dogleg left fairway with a slope on the left side and a reachable fairway bunker.  Most of the greens here are fairly large, so lag putting will come into play.  There aren't any tricks here - it can suit fairway-green style and the bomb-and-gouge crowd.  The driving range desperately needs new balls, but the course is a solid three stars.
3 This is just like Filiberto's. Fast-food mexican food. It's really good and taste pretty authentic to me. My hubby and I stopped in for a quick bite to eat and we went there because he heard it was good from his co-workers. I'm a huge critic of mexican rice and beans and this place has it down. I got the lunch special of the day which was other bean tostadas with beans and rice. It was sooo much food and I was so stuffed!  Next time I will get something smaller. You can't beat all that food for $5! They have a good salsa bar with all the fixings!
other This place is still open, but the name has been changed to Juba, and it is under new ownership. Same spot though, and the food has pretty much stayed the same besides a few changes in the menu. Anyway, I absolutely love coming here. My friend, Molly, is one of the servers, and I love her for introducing me to Ethiopian cuisine. It's definitely a very interesting blend of flavors, but now I come here about once or twice a week and stuff my face. I recommend trying both the vegan combo and the pita sandwich with chicken or falafel. The coffee drinks are delicious too and since they're made with Ethiopian coffee, the taste is very unique. If you've been hesitant about trying Ethiopian food, just get over it and go try the food at Juba. You won't be disappointed!
other oh my, these are huge gyros.  somewhat scary looking at first.  not pressed in their cellar but good enough to find on a food cart in nyc.  simply can not beat the value if you are hungry for lunch.  they do need some greek coffee though.with all the i heart chicago wallpaper, you'd think they would have a plasma TV with my big fat greek wedding on repeat play,
other Obligatory stop for a drink...Dodey is here so that is always good
other This is one super cool cafe/lounge.  They serve coffee, cocktails, and some quick bites that can go along great with your drinks.  There are several rooms you can choose from to sit and relax.  Art decor surrounds this stylish joint and just had a great time here sipping on coffee and chatting with a friend who recommended this coffee shop to me.  I noticed a younger adult crowd here but it doesn't matter.  Wi-Fi friendly, too!
other Great place for cheap drinks! Everybody knows each other and you can becom part of the Playa family quick :)Sharen ( the owner ) is very friendly and nice and she will remember your name and what you drink after one visit.Great place to watch games !
3 I have always enjoyed the quesdillas at Chili's. Try their happy hour where they offer bottled and draft beers. There chicken tenders are okay but they are breaded and I do not care for breaded chicken tenders but rather the grilled ones which they do not offer. The salsa here is not very good, I have tasted store bought salsa that tastes much better. The best thing Chili's has to offer is the happy hour.
other Wood fired pizzas, scrumptious pasta dishes and bacon wrapped shrimp.  How can you go wrong with a place that wraps things in bacon.  C'mon, even  veggies admit that things wrapped in bacon are good!  Has a smokey atmosphere and a slight bar crowd but the food is outstanding.
other I remember my first visit to Delux,it was before heading over to shop in the craziness that is Last Chance. Anyway my friend suggested this spot because of their sweet potato fries...that's all she had to say, I was down!! It's a trendy little spot inside of a strip mall, it kinda looked outta place but it stood out in a good way.I ordered the sweet potato fries they were yummy (I like mine a little crispier, but they were still delish)  and the CHINESE CHICKEN SALAD...Mmmmmm the flavors were amazing, the red peppers, cilantro, romaine and that peanuty vinaigrette is too die for! I was a little worried that I wasn't going to get full but this salad was easily large enough for 2.I'm ashamed to say that the 3 times that I have been to Delux I have had this salad, I'm hooked. Next time I promise I will venture out and try one of these burgers everyone keeps raving about...maybe.
3 We went here on a Saturday afternoon and this place was incredibly empty.  They had brunch specials going on, including $other bloody mary's and mimosas, but we were more in the mood for lunch.  Except for the bloody mary, I had to try one.  It came out in a high-ball-sized glass.  Boo!  But it was really tasty. Yay!  The hubby remembered a sign outside the restaurant a few weeks back that said they had Arrogant Bastard, and he got a 2other oz bottle for $4.75.  Hey, that's not fair!!Next up: the wings.  We were a bit hesitant to order them when the waitress informed us that they are "seasoned" but not sauced, so they can't be ordered hot.  We did ask for them crispy though, and the waitress even asked the cooks to throw them back in for a few minutes when they came out not visibly crispy.  These non-traditional wings were actually pretty damn good.  The seasoning was a little spicy and salty with just a hint of sweet.  If I were in the mood for the tang and kick of Frank's Hot Sauce, these wouldn't cut it, but otherwise they were good enough to go back again for.My entree was the Tilapia salad, and I was a bit disappointed.  The fish was a bit dry and uninspired. And the greens underneath were overdressed and wilted.  I ate the greens around the fish and picked out the almonds and Mandarin oranges, but I had to leave the mush hiding underneath the fish.It wasn't bad enough to say I wouldn't go back, but I won't be anxiously awaiting my next trip.
3 My wife stayed here while transitioning to Arizona and enjoyed her stay. The hotel seems modern and they are currently renovating the place; so far so good with the improvements.
other While the menu looked promising, have no idea if the food is any good since the hostess failed to even acknowledge our presence when we walked in the door.   We patiently stood there for several minutes while she walked around us to greet and seat two other parties.   Since we were still unable to get her attention,  we left and went to Tommy Bahama across the street.
other This place is too freaking cute!!!  The OJ is literally one of the best glasses I've ever had.  I had the typical eggs, bacon, and toast and it was amazing.  The bacon was crispy without being burnt, the toast had just the right level of buttery goodness and the eggs were folded such as a crepe and fluffy goodness.  I also tried a bite of the pulled pork burger which was amazing, and the touch of apple put it over the top.  Another plus was the garden patio area that feels homey like someones backyard.  I will definitely be back to this cozy establishment!
3 Some friends came in so a group of 6 of us went here.  Cool little place with good atmosphere, basic and cozy.  Wines by the glass were good.  The bread was a bit stale but still pretty decent.  We ordered a variety of things.  The antipasto plate was good with several typical items.  My tomato sausage pizza was good, not great.  Needs some spice and flavor.  The halibut over sundried tomato basil risotto with aspargus was very good but the halibut was a little over cooked.  Otherwise, most everybody liked the food.  One person ordered a dish and asked for a little spice but it was way too spicy and they basically couldn't eat it.  Her husband ate it the next day because he could handle the spice but seriously it was way too spicy for most people.  Not a bad place, would probably go back but won't drive out of the way as the location is a little out there.
other This gym is great...  I joined because it opened only about 3 minutes away from my house.  I keep going back because every person who works there is so nice and greets you with a smile and a friendly hello.  It is not intimidating at all, which is a big step up from the LA Fitness that I used to go to.  The staff gets to know you by name and most of the other members are quite friendly as well.   The gym is open enough that you can do free weights on your own without bumping into anyone and there are always plenty of cardio machines available.   I've been going there for over a year and plan to continue doing so!
other This restaurant is incredible, and has the best pasta carbonara and the best tiramisu I've had in my life. All the food is wonderful, though. The calamari is not fried. The bread served with dinner comes right out of the oven, and the tomatoes are the freshest I've tasted outside of my mom's own garden. This is great attention to detail.I can no longer eat at any other Italian restaurant without feeling slighted. This is the first place I want take out-of-town visitors I'm looking to impress.The owner, Jon, is helpful, friendly, and really cares about providing a positive dining experience. He's spot on with his wine recommendations, and he organizes wine tasting events which you can find out about by joining the mailing list or Facebook page.
other 6 cities in 10 days.....no significant delays, great service and the food was even good. Get rid of the lowly 757's to Hawaii and give me the fancy LAX-JFK 777 for all other hour flights, plus redo the overhead compartments in the 767's and I'll give Delta other stars. Great job with the merger as the employees/customers seem much, much happier!
other Just went tonight.  Was looking for some late night Mexican food and atmosphere a step above most things that are open this late and found success.This place is definitely trying to pull off cool and I think they do a pretty good job of it.  Their expansive selection of Tequila, enhances the mood they set out to create.I do not like that you had to pay for chips and salsa but the food was pretty cheap for how nice the restaurant was, so I think it evens out.  They might charge for chips because it's the kind of restaurant where you could spend several hours drinking and if people ate chips the whole time that was happening it wouldn't be profitable.  I say this because their alcohol is a good deal.  16 oz. Dos Equis for four bucks on tap and it wasn't happy hour!This place is a balance of modestly priced mexican, drinking and nice atmosphere.  The food is not amazing but it's good, and with the atmosphere and wanting to eat at 1other at night this restaurant/bar is overall impressive.  (If weren't for the late late night aspect would probably only give it three stars)
other I don't expect much when grabbing lunch at a mall, but I expect better than this.  The seaweed salad was a generic overly soy tasting disappointment, the rainbow roll was barely worth eating - the shrimp on the roll tasted fishy, the fish was mealy-textured, and the rich was soft and too sticky.  The yellow tail roll suffered from the same, and we luckily were cautious enough not to try sashimi.  The miso soup was served barely like warm.  The tea was served barely luke warm. That was when we finally got service, which took a veritable eternity.  Tea refills?  Good luck on getting someone's attention for that.The inside is a dismal, cavernous sport-bar/pool hall sort of feel.  Basically no redeeming features here.
other As a frequent traveler into Scottsdale, I was looking for something new and different to celebrate with a young up and coming professional baseball player---who happens to be my nephew. We were forewarned this place had no prices on their online menu and appeared to be owned by Mastro's which consistently has excellent food. Michael Dominick opened Dominick's Lincoln Avenue Prime Steakhouse last fall after baseball season in the small, but excellent Scottsdale Quarter. (I'll admit to frequenting this Nike store in travels to Phoenix.) The ambiance is that of an elegant steakhouse. The rooms are dark with huge crystal chandeliers. Very opulent without being ostentatious!. We both ordered the bone-in filet which is an excellent aged prime cut. Supposedly, according to our very professional server, this cut is about 16 oz with a bone yielding about a 1other oz serving. My limit on steak is typical 6-8 ounces and I ate my entire meal, making me think (1) This place really is THAT GOOD, and (2) I doubt this is more than a 10 oz serving. We started with a warm assortment of breads and in deference to my guest, we minimized the veggie's ordered. (I'll go back during baseball season :-) ) After ordering a glass of of the extensive, but reasonably priced wine list, we looked at dinner entree. The steaks come with a choice of rubs and sauces. The house rub was described as "cajun-style, but not overwhelming". My theory is sauces on steaks are useful for poor cuts of meat, but take away from great cuts; hence, I went no sauce. The result was an incredibly great dinner of Bone-in filets ordered medium rare, no sauce and a loaded mashed potato side. (This side comes pre-prepared or you can ask for ramikans of cheese, chives, bacon and sour cream and build as you like at the table. We finished with a scoop of ice cream and a cappuccino for desert. Excellent steak spot and a welcome high-end addition to the Scottsdale food scene.One comment: The "Branding" of the restaurant is confusing. Either call it "Dominick's" or "Lincoln Avenue", but not both. This actually caused confusion in trying to locate this spot and diminishes the feng shui and brand loyalty you'd want to keep and associate. (Qualifier: I'm not a branding expert and this is strictly my opinion.) I would love to see Mastro's try a southwest cuisine spot!
3 Getting boring in here.  It's been at least 6 months since they open but they have the same old flavors. I know you guys been busy but what happen to the "rotating flavors"???  Not sure if it's a seasonal thing or a cost factor but even the pomegranate toppings are gone (although they have pomegranate fro yo......not a fan of mine).  Competitions are moving in so change is not a bad thing.
other The building itself has that Frank Lloyd Wright 70s vibe going on...not my taste, but our City isn't very old so I can live with this minor aesthetic annoyance.  (Remember when they almost tore the Orpheum down? Not cool. Fight to keep history here folks...)Anyway, anytime I hear people begrudgingly ask "What is there to do in Phoenix?"  I would have to suggest: We do have culture here, if you're willing to venture outside of your comfort zone and outside of the suburbs. Phoenix is privileged enough to have an Opera Company and Ballet Company who are great at what they do. I saw the Nutcracker most recently and GOODNESS, they all had impressive resumes.  The conductor, and costume designer were definitely stand outs.  As audience members we are supremely lucky because the venue itself is small enough to ensure you will have a fantastic seat no matter where you are.I will go back. I can't wait to go back. My soul craves this, as should yours.
other I dig the breakfast been to 7th and 38th and had Nan's breakfast, Plus have had tamales too so really is something to come back. In 13-years (I live in Cali) been here 26 times and not fancy (although 7th is the one with great pottery and colors inside. I ate other time for lunch of dinner and 2other times for brekafast
other The food is good and the location is perfect. A solid breakfast spot in Oldtown. Everything on the menu looks fantastic. I went the healthy route this morning and went with the Quick Start Conscious. other egg whites, broccoli, tomato, fruit and cottage cheese. Phenomenal for a healthy breakfast out.   Breakfast club also brews a pretty solid cup of coffee that gives me a pretty good buzz for only having two cups.The only real negative is the outside seating. It seemed good in theory on a cool day in Scottsdale with temperatures only in the seventies. However, being right on Scottsdale Road, it was hard to hear the people I was eating with because of all the passing traffic. I'd advise that anyone dining here eat inside (where it unfortunately can also be a little loud since the place is always busy).
other I heard about this little gem earlier in the week, and after looking at the menu online and reading some reviews from fellow yelpers, I decided I would try it out. The restaurant was very clean and I enjoyed the music playing, but I think it could use a little more color in the dining room. I was greeted upon entering and was asked if I had been here before. The waiter was very friendly and took the time to explain some of the dishes to me. I asked about the pof pof and he explained that they are like donuts, but better. I passed on them. I ordered the jerk steak over jolof rice, a meat patty, and plantains. First came out the meat patty. The pastry tasted like cornmeal to me, and not flakey like I had hoped. The filling was quite good and just enough spice without going overboard. The steak was very tender and flavorful, with a little bit of heat. For the price, you get your money's worth and I'll have enough left-overs for tomorrow's lunch. Before leaving, the waiter gave me a complimentary pof pof, and in my opinion, it was better than a donut.I'll definitely be going there again.John H
other In today's environment of zero tolerance of drinking and driving (for millions of good reasons), its good to have a phone number programmed in your cell phone that is truly useful when you've had a little too much to drink. This ain't no other a.m. booty call. This is a call that gets you home safely and back to your car in the morning all for a few mere dollars that potentially saves you thousands in the long run.Yes, you can also call a myriad of other cab companies, but the thing I love most about Execuar is the professionalism that they bring to my front door each and every time they pick me up or take me home. Do they make mistakes, sure. Have they left me waiting for an inexcusable amount of time before, yes. But they have done their "fare-share" in managing those few situations. There's damn good reason they are one of my top-five speed dials.
other We were staying at the Marriott Canyon Villas and went to Roys for Happy Hour.  Between 4:00 - 6:00 Roys has a great Happy Hour.  $5.00 drinks, including their Hawaiian martinis and $5.00 appetizers.  We had lobster pot stickers, tuna sushi, and California rolls.  All were delicious.  I've never eaten a meal at the restaurant but if you want a nice little buzz and a pretty full stomach in a lovely environment on a pauper's budget, this IS the place.  Don't miss it if you are nearby.
other Tough to rank this place...   it is a retirement community first off.   The club house is awesome.   Pool is salt water and heated.   Courses are nice, little bit of a challenge but basically flat.   The putt putt course is very challenging and really cool.    I'm not impressed at all with the club food and suggest staying away from the roast beef.   It seemed fake.
other I stayed here for two nights the first week of April 2012.  Woot. Arizona weather really is the best. Overall, it was a nice place to stay. Purdy too. I bought a deal on Hotwire and wasn't sure what hotel I was booking until I paid, and it turned out to be this resort.  Overall, very satisfied for the price I paid.  However, I do not think I would pay $200+ a night here.  At that point, I would say it's not worth it.The entrance is gorgeous and nicely updated. Trendy, modern, yet warm. Love the lit deer heads.  I want them.  It feels like a high class resort when you first go through the entrance.  Once you head to the rooms though, it does seem like an older resort.  However, our room was nicely decorated and very clean so no complaints in that area.If you are missing your pets from home, be sure to ask for a pet fish during your stay! I asked for one, well, I had to ask twice because they forgot the first time... But soon I had a goldfish in my room which I named Basil.  (Due to me becoming inebriated on one too many cucumber basil martini's... Don't judge)As for the room/parking, it's very easy to park extremely close to the entrance to the rooms which we liked.  It was easy to navigate in and out as the resort is fairly small.  The room itself, ours faced the parking area, which we didn't really care either way about.  It was close to the pool so that was good enough for us.  However, I will say the bed sucked.  When my husband turned, I too turned and bounced along with him.  They badly need to upgrade to better beds. While not uncomfortable per se, I don't enjoy feeling every teeny movement of my partners.They had nice toiletries- C.O Bigelow.  I enjoyed those little aspects.For an hour every evening they had free wine happy hour, which we did check out one of the evenings.  Hey, no one complains about Free Wine!!!  Nothing special, but it did the trick.Hotel Bar: Had some kick ass cocktails.  Plenty of strength and tasty concoctions.Biggest Bummer?  The pool area.  Don't get me wrong, it's pretty. First appearances are good.  There is plenty of shade from large palms and such and there's an area for kiddies with sand.  However, there is not enough chairs for the amount of guests.  And the guests that are there put towels on all the chairs even if they aren't around, which is not cool.  Suggestion to hotel:  Perhaps walk around every hour and remove towels if no one's been sitting there for awhile?  It's not fair for a select few to have a chair all day, while others are unable to lay by the pool at all.  And while there is plenty of shade, for me that was another downfall.  Almost too much shade.  It was hard to find areas to sun in compared to those covered by shade.  It made me majorly pissy.  Sun is why I came to AZ.Overall, a great place close to downtown Scottsdale and a walk away from the mall. Perfect for those who want to spend time near the action.  If you can get a good deal here, it's worth the stay. Plus, they have a free shuttle if you want to go somewhere a few  miles from of the place.  (so you can drink and have a driver)
3 Had breakfast this morning while waiting on getting my windows on my car tinted. I had the build your own omelete. I got it with chorizo bell peppers and cheddar cheese. It was pretty good and the portion size was big for the price. They had fresh squeezed orange juice too. Not the best breakfast I've had but it was good.
3 3.other stars. Went to the Calo Flamenco show this past Sunday, brilliantly talented company of dancers and musicians.The Center just completed a year-long renovation this May, completely refurbished all 1,500+ seats, added guardrails and orchestra level handicap-accessible seating, and enhanced their central A/C system. The Chandler Symphony offers free concerts on monthly basis. The Center's programming schedule can be found here: http://www.chandlercenter.org/performances.html
other There are bunch of different tours. I went on the hour long one (probably the cheapest one as well) where I didn't see the bedrooms or inside of the house.It was very hot coming here on a summer day - I do NOT recommend it. They do provide you with water and a red umbrella though. I learned a lot about architecture from the tour and why certain things were done.I would recommend coming here during the fall seasons because they mentioned you can see the tents out there. So quick summary - basically, Frank Lloyd Wright would live at this place during the winter months when it was warm in Arizona but super cold where he's from. He didn't come here during the summer months - way too hot!
other I hate ordering flowers sight unseen, but needed a local florist for a sympathy arrangement. Rachel immediately alleviated any concern when we discussed what I wanted in detail, and she even emailed me a photo of the final arrangement. Gorgeous flowers, same day delivery and reasonable pricing - can't beat that.
other My husband and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Every time we drive by he wants to go in and eat. Even if we are driving home from a dinner we just had!! 1. The people that work there are AMAZING. They are so nice and hospitable, always glad to see you and let you decide the type of dining experience you want. (romantic date, take out, quick bar eats, etc.) 2. This is the freshest place for seafood I have found in Phoenix. I don't know how they find half of the stuff the serve, but they do, and it is just off the boat. (I lived in Boston for 3 years and they get stuff I crave, like Kumomato Oysters, all types of fish and meat from East Coast farms) 3. Pricing is right on...since they are serving stuff that is difficult to procure, I am always amazed at the value they present. Keep Rocking Yasu!!!
other Possibly the best Pho soup I have ever had! I can't believe I ate the whole thing! Well...yes I can, actually. What clinched it for me was that I ordered it To Go, which is almost never a good idea when it comes to the pho (do not attempt to assemble at your desk! I repeat! Do NOT assemble at your desk!). But everything was securely packaged and well-presented. Plenty of everything (noodles, meat, herbs, sauce, jalapenos, etc) and oh so tasty. I've got my sights set on the BBQ Pork & Rice noodle bowls for my next visit, which will be soon. Go get your pho on!
other Very sexy place where people love to be seen. Very pretentious but I liked it! Food is just ok - I have had better!
other I really like Fresh and Easy. I've actually come to dread any time I need to go into a Safeway, Basha's, or Fry's. They're too big! I live alone, I spend most evenings cooking my own meals, and I am on a budget. Fresh and Easy is just right for me. And on the plus side, over the past two years F&E has really grown in the right ways.They carry more varieties of fresh produce now. (I used to get upset that I couldn't buy leeks at F&E. I can now.) They have more specialty food items. (I cook a lot of vegan, Indian, Thai, and Mexican food. Used to need to make two grocery trips, but no longer.) Unlike some of the other reviewers, I really like their prepared foods. I mean, no prepared food will ever be as good as my own cooking, but if I'm in a hurry, it's good!They also have really great coupons. The weekly mailer has a $3 off $30 coupon at the least. I recently got a $other off $25. And they now have the F&E Friends card which, on the simplest level, gives you money back for the money you spend. Sure, it's not a whole lot, but I'll take what I can get!The employees are always helpful, and have become much better baggers than in years past. (I'm picky about how my groceries are arranged inside of my reusable bags!)Needless to say, Fresh and Easy has won me over, and unless I learn that they use the tears of kittens to shine the floors (or something equally extreme), I'll continue to go back for my groceries.
other Enjoyed lunch at the bar with my wife while on vacation.  The bartender was one of the owners, the wife half who works a full time job elsewhere and the rest of her free time at the restaurant.Nice beer selection, just the right size floor plan with great outdoor space, and you could feel the care the new owners put into the place.Great neighborhood cafe.
other I found this place based on Yelp reviews so I feel obligated to add one more other star review to the mix. I needed to get a chain fixed on my bike and was not looking to spend a ton of money or hours trying to fix it myself. So I stopped by and had them take a look at it. They recommended a full tuneup to keep it in tip top shape and spent the time explaining and demonstrating why it is deserving of spending money beyond the chain repair.  I ended up passing but didn't feel like they were trying to take advantage of me. Since it was close to closing time I left the bike with them overnight and got a call late in the morning the next day for pickup. It has been as good as new ever since. Having my fair share of riding in the Valley of the Sun I'm sure I'll be back soon for some inter-tubes or a spare part for whatever craigslist bike I happen to be riding around at the time.Protip: Check out the unique bike artwork they have around the place. Also they have a small BMX (?) track in their "backyard" you can ride around and do jumps on anytime.
other I love this place. The Las Vegas roll is amazing however the crispy California roll isn't that crispy. Their sake is in fact bomb and the restaurant it always a good time. Their prices are reasonable for sushi places in Tempe and the service has always been awesome. If you've got a party bigger than other though, call ahead.
other Still not in love with it.Again with the overstaffing and employees huddled, eating/drinking and chatting instead of hurrying up and making my drink.  it is okay to hurry--or is that just my strange, city-thinking?meh.
other Like others, I found this studio through a Living Social coupon.  It is a great studio.  Kim is so friendly and fun.  I would highly recommend the yoga classes.  They are both challenging and relaxing!  It is a small studio, but that gives it a really nice, intimate feel.  I definitely recommend it!
other If I were to ever get hooked on crack... I would want my crack to be these amazing donuts! They are delicious and addicting.
3 Bonkers staff at this small breakfast joints ... One totally overbearing and the other over the top nice but both in a frantic, hyped up on caffine kind of way. Still there was a huge line at the Breakfast Club so we gave The Dose a try. The eggs over easy were broken and our server was confused at the request to have eggs on top of my toast. Turkey sausages were ok and the breakfast potatoes were excellent. So for a regular breakfast it was meh but then I ordered one single buttermilk pancake ... WOW! Perhaps the best pancake I have had in the valley!For a regular b'fast show me to the 5&Diner but for pancakes only I would certainly go back.
other Monday night attract a bros and hos crowd that thinks they are better than everyone else with a few cool people mixed in. The bar is small and there is nowhere to sit so prepare to stand all night. I will only come here on a Monday because there is nowhere else to go.
other I'd leave my Scottsdale bubble for a few reasons (and yes there are additional exceptions)1. Nobuo at Teeter House.2. Fez.3. My friends in various parts of the valleyand 4. Mekong Supermarket.I consider myself to be a huge fan of Asian cuisine. Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Korean, Indian. You name it, I'll eat it. I have my healthy moments, but I am a seasoned eater and I am not afraid of exploring the world through my palate.Mekong is the perfect place for me to massage my senses. The aroma and sensations from the exotic product. The stunning visual of a catfish being bopped on the head, and then cut up and packaged. The cheesy elevator music on the loudspeaker. The delicious taste of a spring roll from the hot food bar. This place has it all.I usually come here for my Asian condiments and live seafood. Want a live crab? Boom. Done. Want spicy mustard or sriracha in a large bottle for cheap? It's yours.To me, there is nothing like taking the 10 mile drive in traffic to Mekong because I know I am going to get everything I want. Make the trek. You won't regret it.
other I needed an oil change reeeeaaaally badly (i know, but i have a honda and those things can run on gas fumes for 30 miles and oil resin for months) and had had an OK experience at the danny's family on HIghland (free wash with a oil change, who doesn't love that?)But. I checked the Danny's site and saw no promotion of the wash and didn't want to drive out of my way for nothing. i checked yelp and this Jiffy Lube had the best rating i could expect for an oil change place and was up the road from work. Downloaded the coupon (thanks for the tip, Kym) and was on my way.Pull in and i tell the guy i want the "Signature" change which includes window wash and floor vacuum, mentioning my $other off coupon. He said that they were already running a special that was $13 off the $3other price so i said a-ok, cowboy. i wait for about 8-10 minutes in the small waiting room (bonus for having a Phoenix Magazine in the stack of Muscle Car Monthly, Oil Today and Antennas Weekly - look, just because i'm getting routine maintenance on my car does not mean i'm INTO cars).I get pulled into the garage area for the "spiel" everybody dreads but it was surprisingly short and non-pushy. (i'm glad they don't drag you over to your engine anymore, that's totally lame). i do have to note that he tried to tell me my right front blinker, my left back blinker and my license plate lights were out. i had JUST gone to Checker to replace my left front blinker light and went through some extensive light checking and so found this news odd. i kept saying as much, and he kept insisting and i was about to ask to see for myself when he calls out to another worker "Hey, was that the honda with the lights or the jeep?" the other guy says "the jeep." however, there was no other car in the place. hmmmmmmmm.OK, so i pay up ($2other altogether with a tax or fee or something added in) and go back into the waiting area while they finish up. I decide to use the bathroom -- and this is where the they lost two stars (this was, up until then, quite possibly a four-star experience - wait, two stars for a bathroom, you ask? oh, you just wait...)the bathroom was filthiest thing i have seen in my life, and i've been to some raunch truck stop pee holes. literally, piss, in the bowl... i get in closer and i shit you not (pun intended) four shit smears in the bowl as well (yeah, i counted). two rolls of TP hanging out on top of the dispenser, each with one square left on them. realizing i need to sterilize my hands from just walking into this mess, i discover no soap or paper towels (not very surprising). as well, hair clippings all over the sink, like the guys are trimming their moustaches on their break. un-freaking-believable. i am still haunted by this bathroom experience.but car's running great!
other My friend who I was visiting and I went here for a fundraiser type of a deal.  I don't know what I was expecting but I really liked the island concept of the place.  My friend recommended a salad and I got a Caribbean chicken salad with some sort of coconut rice, chicken,  oranges, pineapple, tortilla strips, etc.  Well, the salad was huge!!!  The honey lime dressing was very flavorful and complimented the salad well.  We shared the rumbi fries, which were a combination of sweet and regular fries, and as aforementioned in some other reviews, I love the sweet potato fries and wish they all could have been that (do I sound like the Beach Boys?).  The decor was pretty cute and the music was great (Marley, Buffett type stuff).  The rice bowls looked fantastic, as did the sandwiches.  The prices were pretty good, considering the amount of food you received.
other I am new to the Phoenix area and was in the mood for someone else to cook my breakfast for a change and stumbled across all these rave reviews of Matt's on yelp. Normally I find that the yelp reviews are just about spot on and very honest. This is my first case of the contrary. I don't know what hole in the wall "amazing" breakfast joint these reviews were for, but I must have been at the wrong place.........Don't get me wrong this place is reasonably priced for your basic breakfast, but that is about it. I gave them an extra star for using "local" ingredients. This place is below Waffle House and the like on my list. The hash browns were more like a chopped potato omelet that needed a few more minuets, I.E. raw mashed potato in the middle. They take "over easy" a little too serious also. If there were such a thing as egg tar tar, that's what was on my plate. If you have ever had eggs like this, the ones that can't even be eaten with a fork, then you know my pain. I will say my pork chop was good, but who can screw up a pork chop? The bread was good, nice thick cut slices of what looked to be locally baked loafs. The preserve that came with said toast was okay too, but it got snatched away before I could finish. All in all, this place is good for the sheep that need to eat downtown, but lacks anything for a reason to return or recommend it to anyone. If you are in the area and thinking of eating here, try somewhere else. I didn't have to wait in line like many on yelp have stated, and I'm sure glad I didn't for that lack of quality. There are many other options in the area, give someone else a shot that's not banking on you eating there because they were on T.V.................
3 Its refreshing to find one-of-a-kind places -- God knows Phoenix needs more of them to inject personality into this generic, strip-mall, chains-on-every-corner valley. Finding this unique sandwich shop, which is in a house that has been transformed into a restaurant, is indeed a welcome find. The real estate is limited, so parking is compact and circles around the back of the building.The dining area is mainly indoors, but there is also a small patio facing the back portion of the parking lot, which is not very scenic. Inside there is art on the wall that can be purchased.They serve wraps, bowls and salads. The food has been pretty good, although it did not knock my socks off. I ordered the Baja Bowl, which is described on their online menu as "Southwestern chicken atop garlic rice, black beans, Monterey jack cheese and topped with lime sour cream and pico de gallo." It was OK, but the chicken was dry and cut in fairly large chunks. It could have possibly been microwaved -- not sure, but there were no southwest flavors to speak of. I have done a better job of cooking chicken on my George Foreman grill at home. Perhaps the garlic rice would have helped with the flavor, but I had substituted the rice with organic brown rice which did little to add flavor. Sour cream was not "lime". There was a small slice of lime served on the edge of the bowl. I would not bother ordering this again -- especially if I have a craving for some southwest food.On another recent visit I ordered a wrap called "Prince of Thai's - Spicy peanut chicken with baby spinach, garlic rice, fresh ginger slaw, cucumber pico and red onion wrapped in a spinach tortilla." That had better flavor than the baja bowl. Vegetable ingredients were fresh and good. Again, I was not very impressed with the chicken chunks.One thing I think That's A Wrap needs to address is the use of styrafoam cups. Afterall their slogan is "Healthy Food for a Hungry Planet" and they have a link for a new restaurant "Green" for Vegan food on their website. For such an artsy, earthy place, I would have thought That's A Wrap would have made more conscious, earth-friendly choices. For that reason and the bland chicken, I give them an average rating only.
other Fun Irish-pub type vibe with a great beer selection and not your typical bar food. I love the oysters on the half-shell, salads, sandwiches and fried zucchini/mushroom combo.Casey's offers inside dining and a bar - but the expansive patio is the hang-out spot. The clientele is varied and full of regulars. People from all ages and backgrounds hang out here but it's especially popular with ASU students, staff and faculty. The only downside is parking can be difficult, service sometimes slow and it can become fairly crowded - especially on the weekend.
3 Very VERY average. Actually disappointed in the braciole. Kelsey with the pretty smile and form fitting shorts would probably make me think about going back and trying something different.
other All I have to say is what you see on the menu is not what you're gonna get. and if you're ok with cockroaches on the walls and floors, the this is the place to eat.
3 Chicken schnitzel was amazing. Service was slow and server didn't know the menu. Didn't know what a knish was.
other Mmmmmmm butterrrrr. I'm speaking specifically of the Edamame with truffle butter. We probably could have eaten a few orders of these. Sugar cane pork. Ohhh yes. Falls of those teeny little bones right into my mouth. Very finger foody. Delicious. Spicy "Sirring" Shrimp. Comes out sizzling and spicy and delicious. As the server mentioned, "Sirring" isn't a real word, but who cares!These three were the stars of the five tapas that we chose. I cant really remember the other two, so they clearly weren't that great. The atmosphere is cute, artsy and pretty comfortable. The music was a little low, so we could hear the conversations of the couples on either side of us pretty easily. Kinda awwwwkwaaaard. I would for sure return.
other After bad experience, I will never return.  It is terrible since they didn't meet my expectation and the price is outrageous.  The most difficult part of the Pho is the broth (req 16 hours of preparation) and it tasted like water.  I had to add all kind of condiments to rescue it but can't even eat it.  The restaurant is very slow now and it confirmed what I meant with Asian restaurant.  If your fellow Asians don't patronize the place, it is  because your food did not meet our expectation.  Try across the street to the Rice plate Kim Thanh for their rice dish.  It is night and day.
other There was hair in the food. Not just other but other in the same Bhel Puri dish.The whole experience was pretty bad. There is no indication of how you order your food and when you finally figure it out the food does not taste good. We checked sodas on the order sheet and when no sodas showed up we asked if we were supposed to go and find our own sodas from the front of the store and were told that that was the case.Also the guy at the counter is down right dismissive.Pani Puri was OKPapdi Chaat - boring, no flavorBhel Puri - boring and no flavor before we found the hairsNot worth the trip.
other had a wonderful experience here from first drink to last bite. Atmosphere has a nice chic upscale feel to it and the lighting is nice and cozy. We waited in the nice bar while we waited for our table. The orange martini they have is just heaven. After a few of those down the hatch i tried a "keg" size glass of wine and was great as well. This is def a steak joint, so about 90% is all about steaks but there are some salads, fish and crab options. (they are also having a lobster special right now). Lover had the prime rib and crab combo and loved it( they are apparently really known for their prime rib) i went with the crab off course and did not disappoint. The staff was very nice and very patient and i noticed that just about everyone that works here is good looking also. just a pretty place filled with pretty people and good food!
other We started our hike from the Central/7th Ave. entrance.  This is quite a hike initially.  You will be out of breath if you're not a cardio master.  I've been working out other days a week for the past 6 months and I was huffing and puffing a bit.  I felt like a chump because I was having a rough time at first, but after the initial hill, it's not bad.  The views of Phoenix are beautiful, but like Dan E.'s review said......"Don't let the beautiful desert deceive you" it is toasty up there even on a beautiful 8other degree day like yesterday.  Always bring water!
other As far as sports bars go, this one can't be beat. You won't find one in the East Valley with better food, beer selection, happy hour, or a friendlier staff. This is hands-down one of my favorite places in all of Ahwatukee and the surrounding areas.I've been here bunches of times, and the only one bad experience I had (overcooked burger) they took care of the situation above and beyond.I can't say it enough: go, eat, drink, see for yourself: Public House is the best around.
other This place has NO clue when it comes to pricing men's items, and I would not recommend them at all.  I consigned a leather briefcase worth close to $600, and they priced it for $90, giving me a whopping take-home of $40.  I understand the need to move merchandise quickly (and naturally, this sold in a matter of days), but cannot fathom why they would not attempt to get more money for the item.  I can only assume they did not do their research before setting the price.  Consigner beware!
other Every time I come here the staff is so rude! Its the closest bar to my gate so I'm kinda stuck. Hey staff, can you please pretend to like people????
other Pretty yummy! I just went here for lunch and thought the pricing was the best feature. $6.9other for all entrees, which includes a bowl of spicy chicken soup (not sure of name). I ordered the Panang with pork and loved it. It had great flavor and the serving size was appropriate for lunch. Don't let the restaurant's outside appearance scare you - the inside is not too bad. The servers were very nice and efficient. I'll be back, guaranteed, because they serve quickly and it works for my lunch hour.
other Alright, I have been away from Yelp for quite some time, and I feel that this place is fitting to be my comeback review...Chicken and Waffles.  Yes, chicken and M'Fin waffles.  In the ghetto?  CheckHas sweet tea?  CheckHas no-nonsense, quick service?  CheckRidiculously long wait?  CheckBest thing that I have eaten in the last year?  CheckI have to say, not the best fried chicken I have ever had, but pretty damn good- it could use more seasoning.  Now the waffles, probably the best ever...  The waffles are deliciously soft inside, a little crispy out with a wonderful cinammoness to them.  The seating is cramped, but it doesn't matter as soon as your food is delivered your table goes quiet, you get tunnel vision and after the first bite you are taken away to an orgy of goodness.If you are in Phoenix, this is a requirement.  Come real early or be prepared to wait.  Don't forget to order the Red Velvet cake and they have Kool-Aid if that fits your fancy.  Even after I came home from Arizona, I couldn't stop talking about LoLo's for like other weeks.  Shoot, two months later and I am still drooling thinking about it...
other I am so glad I found this nursery! Not only is it a beautiful place but the employees are unbelievable, so helpful and knowledgeable. Needed to get my garden ready for planting and they helped with everything. The plants they have look great, not all wilted like some other places. Think this has become one of my weekend stops.
other I learned of this company through a living social deal. I emailed them to set up an appointment. The earliest available date was a month later, I went ahead and scheduled the appointment in spite of the wait time. One month went by,  on the scheduled day of cleaning in which I was told they would arrive between 1other and 1... NO ONE shows up. I wait, at 3:30 I email asking why was this scheduled appointment not kept?... I've yet to get a response or an explanation.There are many cleaning companies out there, my suggestion - try a different one than Maid other it all.
other Welcome to the funkiest place in Goodyear. If you've been craving sheet-metal winged pigs but regretting that Cave Creek is practically a day trip from the west valley, you may feel tempted to lie on the floor and weep tears of joy.This Armadillo provides fine circuit training for working off breakfast at the Black Bear Diner, including a loft with moderately steep stairs. Like its cousin up toward Metro Center, it's an "antique mall" in the sense of focusing mostly on vintage items and less uncommon antiques, plus a smattering of "collectibles." This is the kind of antique mall I prefer, since it really functions as a sort of fantasy department store for shoppers who have a middle-of-the-road budget but whimsical or retro tastes.Like the other Armadillo, stock here runs somewhat more to the frilly and ornate than to the mid-century modern, but it's not a total lock-out of swellness in favor of sweetness. Unlike the other one, there's a larger variety of dealers who aren't typical antique-mall fare: things like reproduction hardware, the aforementioned sheet-metal winged-pigs, repro tin signs, garden ornaments made from vintage dishes. This isn't my cuppa, but in context, it provides useful variety, and it fills booths (there are more empty booths here, but it's still fairly new).A number of dealers seem to actually be replicated here, including the scrapbook store. Also replicated is the cheery professionalism of the operation: clean restrooms, occasional seating areas, efficient check-out, and available snacks. When you're hiking a layout this big, these things come to matter.
other Terrible service--they replaced my phone screen and it broke within other wks. Phone was not dropped or mishandled, just cracked and "owner" would not honor their warranty. They only accept cash--that should be a red flag if you are considering a business like this!
other I was so, so hopeful.  October in Scottsdale, yummy, tacos.....Wow!  Rip Off!! $10 Just to get in (what was that for?). No shade unless you were buying a drink.  Most places wouldn't give you salsa or taco sauce with your measly over priced taco. They seemed like the vultures who didn't care about the customer, just the $other ticket they could grab from you.  I had to beg for a napkin then hunt for a place to sit feeling watched by the other vultures waiting for me to get up.I was ready to leave after 4other minutes and my Pepsi had gotten warm, so I had gotten a cup of ice from the bar.   I poured it in, took one drink and as I was leaving to hike back to my car, security stopped me and would n't let me take it out! "It could have booze in it".  Well, by then, I was one angry little local. Dumped it all in trash and said to my sweet daughter in law who was about to "go mad" with me, "Get me outta here!". She had brought her other year old, thinking what a fun way to spend a Saturday morning and encourage our local businesses.  Nope.  Not good.
other I've been coming here for several years.  Can't find my first review.  I guess it was too long ago.  So here comes another one.The woman who runs the place.  I've forgotten her name.  She is one of the most gracious, friendly, and kind people you can ever hope to meet.When I go there, sometimes with and some times without my wife, I alway order the small sausage sandwich.  With ajvar and onion, this can't be beat no matter how you my search around.  The sausages, cevap, are delicious and what's unusual is that the bread is almost as good as the sausages.  Simply delicious from all points of view.  They make their own sausages and their own bread from scratch.  In fact they make everything from scratch right there in the restaurant.  Their soups are do die for.A very favorite of ours.I give this a other star because in the Bosnian/Jugoslavian cuisine catagory, this can't be beaten.One more thing worth mentioning:  her Baklava is top of the mark.  It's not as sweet as what you find in other restaurants.  Everything is simply top shelf.
other The night was dark and hazy, a midwinter's eve that started with promise. A quick trip to the Yelp site quickly revealed the #other restaurant in Tempe to be, in fact, a brewery. This delighted my boyfriend, a beer connoisseur, and me too, being a fan of highly rated restaurants and anything that makes my man happy. So we headed to the Four Peaks with high expectations and high spirits. Alas, our hopes were dashed almost from the beginning. The hostesses greeted us from the curb. They were extremely young and scantily clad in low, low, LOW slung jeans that did not cover their clearly illegal behinds. The place was crowded so we took a beacon and hit the bar for our first round. The bartender, despite a packed house, noticed us almost immediately and took our orders... the only quick service we received all night. The beers, well, the Kilt Lifter was a fine example of a 80 shilling Scottish ale... but the Raj IPA was heavy in diacetyls and but otherwise a reasonable attempt at an English IPA. Hopknot IPA was above average IPA with pleasing grapefruit aroma.By the time we were seated we were happily woozy from the beers. Unfortunately, it took the bitch waitress nearly 20 minutes to take our orders and another 20 before our meals arrived. Food was decent, although side orders were botched... we DID notice the very nice disposable napkins, which were durable yet soft. Some of the nicest napkins I've ever seen of a disposable nature. Overall, a good people watching experience, very loud and crowded, with terrible service, adequate beer, and generic yet palatable cuisine. Would we go back? Not unless invited by good friends. Overrated.
3 A no frills hole in the wall hamburger joint.  The burger is cooked to order, delicious, and the perfect mix of juicy and slightly greasy so you know you're eating the real deal.  The fixin' bar is an interesting concept which I like since I can pile on as many goodies as I like.  The bar gets a little messy at times, but eh, who cares.The burgers are not the cheapest, but then again if you wanted cheap you'd go to a dollar menu, no?  Its worth the line, and fighting some of the students from across the street (Phoenix College) for a bite at Hamburger Works!
other Carmel Bianca!!! Oh my Effin Gosh... that's the stuff! It's yum. I'm a fan of white chocolate flavored coffee so maybe I'm bias and why I simply enjoyed my 16oz of Carmel Bianca goodness. It's simply espresso, steamed milk, white chocolate and carmel drizzled on top. And that's the signature drink of Dolce Espresso.Thanks to Yelp I decided last night after a driving lesson with L that I was too tired to drive home without something to pick me up... and that was reason enough to make the short trek to Dolce because I've always wanted to try it. Wasn't exactly sure where it was, and happy to find that it's just across from Padre's next to a Psychic place. Dolce has a cool vibe with music videos playing. And they're good songs too... like I had never seen Pitbull's "The Anthem" video... liked it! Enjoyed my Carmel Bianca with a slice of their Chicago Style Cheesecake. I liked the cheesecake because it was different in taste compared to other cheesecakes, it was like a marzipan with cheese frosting on top... so it was interesting. Not really a fan of the German Choc that my friends K and D got. I thought it was dry... yuck! It's a small place that's bright, with four flat screens spread about. The owner, Cesar (I think) was a sweetheart! I just hope Dolce survives as a 2other hour cafe on weekends because this place has potential. It's way better than counterculture cafe back in the day. This is like the best place to go after the bars if you need a pick me up before heading home to the eastside from central Phoenix. Prices are moderate. SO pls check this place out and spread the word... love it and I'll be back!
other I went here last night with my wife to celebrate our other year wedding anniversary.  We purposely arrived early to have a drink at their bar.  There wasn't much of a selection on their happy hour drink menu so we just ordered our go-to drinks.  Champagne for her and a martini for me.  The hostess/waiter/waitress were very friendly and prompt.  When we were ready for dinner we were brought to the main dining area and our bar tab was transferred without trouble.I made a reservation a few weeks prior and made a notation that it was our anniversary.  Upon arrival at our table there was a card saying happy anniversary which was a nice touch.  The table was smack in the middle of the dining room so my wife asked if we could move to another table.  The host was very accommodating and gave us a better table.The place is pretty sheik to the eye but uncomfortable.  The 2-top tables are small, too close to other people, and I don't want to sound like a 90 year old, but the chairs are ridiculously uncomfortable.  I don't know about you but I like to eat my too expensive meal in utter comfort.  The noise level is also above where it should be but they were playing some pretty solid tunes throughout the night.Our waitress was excellent and knowledgeable but was taking care of way too many tables which made her unable to come around as often as I would have liked.  I especially liked our sommelier who gave us an awesome wine recommendation.  Also, I'm not sure if this is all the time or not, but all bottles under $300 were 1/other price so we splurged on a more expensive bottle than we would have normally purchased.The Food:* Fries - they give these to you instead of bread.  They are excellent especially the truffle ones.  My only issue is that you could tell they were sitting out for a half hour before being served to us.  I would have liked them fresh but whatever.* Wedge Salad - just ok.  The blue cheese and bacon were great though.  It just wasn't the typical steak joint wedge I am used to and was looking forward to.* Burrata Cheese - this was very unique to me and pretty good* Truffled Mac n' Cheese - not the best I've ever had but still pretty good.  Not as thick and cheesy as I would have liked and they use weird noodles.* Wagyu Beef Trio - My wife and I shared this.  Perfect amount for the both of us to share.  Each 4oz piece of steak was perfectly cooked, juicy and delicious.  I still can't tell the difference between regular beef and wagyu though.  The sides were also very good.  We especially liked the mushrooms.  The mashed potatoes were too creamy and just eh.* Beignets - we shared these for desert and they are fluffy, sugary awesomeness.  The sauces are equally awesome.All-in-all it was a fantastic meal and great experience.  Good food, good wine, good company.  I would come back any time to enjoy a steak or one of their burgers.
other Very impressed! $other pitcher until 5pm, and excellent healthy food at a good value. Free valet parking.  I look forward to coming back.
3 Good, fresh chinese food, a little pricey.There are two types of chinese food. Cheap, greasy, satisfying chinese food in a questionable joint. And upscale atmospheric chinese food that aspires to captivate the same audiences that enjoy places like P.F Chengs. This would be the latter: an awhatukee hole in the wall version of P.F chengs. Very clean restaurant, nice atmosphere, and good service. You can tell their motif is such that they cater to the tukee types with a little more coin in hand :/. This is the kind of place you'll find a lot of older families, or much older groups of friends dining together in. Both the orange chicken, and the almond chicken were good, and were made barring on the side of caution when it comes to grease. They were big portions (for $8), with big fresh peices of white meat, fresh vegetables, and no MSG. There is no chance of this meal offending a pickier type with grease, textures, or flavors (which makes it less interesting in my opinion).Both dishes were good, but nothing amazing from the other dishes I tried. The green tea ice cream was good, but I've had better green tea ice cream :/ . their version was a little too heavy with cream, and could have used some fruit, or something creative to go with the ice cream. The only other dessert option was another flavor of ice cream.The service was great, very polite and friendly waiters.
3 I love Matts and feel everything about this place is IMPECCABLE. But unfortunately the small capacity seating and over an hour waiting in line ALWAYS turns me away.  Id be around more often if I wasn't wasting my weekends sitting on a hot bench.
3 Ruby Tuesday's salad bar and healthier choices (With caloric count for calorie counters) for entrees is what sets it apart from other chain restaurants that serve your basic American style cuisine.  The salad bar includes other types of base greens (Iceberg and mixed greens), with various toppings (Edamame, peas, mushrooms, croutons etc.) and dressings (Italian, low fat balsamic, ranch, thousand island, etc).  Generally, with any main entree, you will have your choice of side and salad bar, or other sides.  They also have more healthy side options such as roasted spaghetti squash and steamed broccoli.  My husband had the chicken trio, and I had the creole fish on our visit.  The chicken was nicely presented, and was fairly tender and juicy.  Of the three different toppings (Balsamic and tomato, mushroom cheese, and mango salsa), my least favorite was the mango salsa since the mango in it, while fresh, wasn't totally ripe.  The creole fish was presented in a Spartan way, with just one piece of fish with a mound of side next to it on a plain white plate.  The fish (Some type of white fish, maybe carp?) was a freshwater white-flesh fish and had a decent seasoning and was cooked well. Service was friendly, but we did not have any silverware on our table when we were seated and had to ask for it after our entrees were served to us.  Drinks were refilled quickly as needed.I haven't indulged in a lot of the desserts, but I am a fan of the Italian creme cake.  It's moist, and not too sweet.  Prices are moderate, and entrees will be around 1other dollars, give or take a few dollars.
other I have been to this Museum twice so far. And both times I enjoyed myself. But this place is huge. There is so much to see if you are into Native American art or just art and lifestyles, history of Native Americans. I love it. I was recently there to see the Indian Market and seen the Boarding School exhibit and Kachina exhibit. I love seeing all the Kachina dolls. When ever I am in town I know I will always go there to check out the new exhibits.
other 4.other StarsThe seafood tower was amazing and my ribeye was very good.  Very expensive.  Much better experience than the ocean club in Newport Beach.
other The food is good here, ordered the Mole enchiladas with no complaints, however we also ordered a skinny margarita which was not very strong and $1other ea! The regular margaritas are fine and priced okay at $8, but to charge $1other without warning is usury. The service was okay, not great. The menu is also hard to read because the type and busy background design. I would have given other stars if the margaritas were $11, but $15?? This is not Modern Steak or the W !!
other Ok, I'll say this up front, I don't like chains.  There are just far too many awesome restaurants in Phoenix/Scottsdale to go to a chain.That being said, this place is amazing and the quality and consistency here is unreal.  Yes, it "seems" expensive but once you've eaten here you'll realize that you are absolutely getting your moneys worth.So much awesome unlimited red meat.Don't let them trick you with the salad bar!  It's killer but don't fill up!  And don't be ashamed to leave your flipper thing on GREEN, the sign of meat greed. hahahahaha.Lastly, try the Tres Leches and the Key Lime Pie, out of this world.
other There are a lot of places to visit on Mill Avenue . . . however, there is no place like Fat Tuesday!   When we visit Tempe, we always make it a point to stop at "Fats".   We have always visited before the night time crowd comes.  When we walk in the door, the bartenders remember us, suggest yummy drinks, ask about us . . . treat us like we are special.   We have struck up many conversations with other patrons who enjoy going to Fat Tuesdays as much as we do.  During the day it''s a great place to just get out of the heat, cool off with their daquiris and eat a delicious Po Boy.  Jason is our favorite bartender . . . and we have lots of laughs with him!   I am counting the days until weI will be back in AZ to go to Fat Tuesday!
other I was out shopping with my 16 year old son, and we decided to stop in and try America's. The delightful young lady behind the counter highly suggested that we try at least one thing with the pastor filling so we ordered the meal for two for $20. That comes with chips and salsa, two burritos, two tacos and two drinks The carne asada was very good...but OMG...the pastor was amazing! We just wished we had ordered the burrito with the pastor and the taco with the carne asada instead of the other way around. The sweet young thing kept checking in on us...we were there at 3 in the afternoon so it was quiet...but gosh, the young girls had just been fawning over us all day! On the way home, I looked at my kiddo and realized he's pretty darn good looking...so maybe that explains all the delightful customer service that day! Anyway, I can understand some of the complaints about it being a little pricey, but I think you are really getting a quality product and that is worth it to me. Plus, I thought the burrito was especially meaty. And as a carnivore I totally appreciate getting my meat on! Cute place, yummy food, fun day out with the teenager. Really, you can't ask for more than that.
other I took a friend from Europe here this past week. I cannot express how much the attention to detail is welcomed and so wonderfully presented. By this I mean, the service, the presentation, the food, the atmosphere. The staff knows that when you walk in, you will be spending good money and they expect to take care of your whim and cater to your palette. The steaks are buttery, delicious and worth every bite. The sommelier made a wonderful suggestion to go with our order and he was spot on in his selection. This may not be the place to dine on a regular basis for some, but if you plan to make a special night of an occasion, I recommend highly Ruth's Chris. I have not been to the one in Phoenix, only the Scottsdale location, but I would be hard pressed to say that it would be any less tasty. My buddy was treated so kindly and his comment (paraphrased) was as follows: It's too bad that so much of the world hates Americans. They think that Americans are so loud and bossy. They can be so kind and so willing to to be helpful when they want. In Europe, no one cares if you are from France or Italy or Dernmark because we are like states next to each other. In America, everyone wants to know about where you are from and want to hear you talk about it and the places you have been.Thank you to the staff for being a part of my friend's visit.
other Great eats at this joint. New York strip was awesome! Pear salad was bomb and service was superb. I'll be back march 10th!
other Having just moved to Scottsdale, I had seen Four Peaks brews at local restaurants and couldn't wait to try it. My bf and I visited the brewery after a long day at the Phoenix Zoo. The location was easy to find with plenty of street parking (although it could be difficult during peak hours). We found a nice table on the half-indoor seating area. The ambiance was very cool, with a converted loft warehouse sort of feel.The bf had the beer sampler, which I helped myself to some sips of. I ordered a pint of the Kilt Lifter, which was a great deal during happy hour. Next, I tried the Pumpkin Porter (full price, even during happy hour). Foodwise, I had the pub fish and chips, which are battered in Kilt Lifter, and the bf had the french dip. Both items were on par with good quality pub fare.Kilt Lifter: great medium brew, very smooth. The type of beer you could drink every day and never tire of. Pumpkin Porter: we loved it so much, we purchased a growler so we could take some home! Note: there is an extra charge for filling up a growler with a seasonal brew. $other for the growler itself, $10 for beer, and $other seasonal charge. Normal refills of growlers are $10.I am a beer lover. I have spent time living in Munich and drinking some of the best beers in the world. You can't go wrong with Four Peaks brews. Next stop, North Scottsdale location. Closer to home and hopefully just as great!
other One of my lunchtime favorites -- a great bar menu under $10 (steak, shrimp, Italian sausage, etc) with good quality food and prompt service. Fun place to have drinks at happy hour. Plus, they have a nice traditional dining room for dinner. The bar area is always DARK (how it should be).
other Consignment... fantastic. It's a step up from a used furniture store. It's two steps up from a thrift store or a pawn shop. It's three steps up from a garage sale. The prices reflect all of this, but it's still pretty reasonable. Sellers - as long as you didn't buy the ugliest couch in the world and you didn't let your dogs hump on it, then it'll probably sell here. They will look at your furniture first before allowing you to bring it in so you aren't wasting anyone's time. You can even bring in a picture and a pillow if that's easier. In fact, you can even email a photo to them that they will go by. If it sells, they will give you anywhere from 4other to 5other percent of the money collected. To find out if it has sold, you can call. For security reasons, they won't give out much information over the phone, so you must bring in your paperwork to even ask how much it sold for. This is pretty annoying and inconvenient - they should do email notifications at least - but you can go into any location to get this information at least.I got the impression that they will let you set your own price, but typically they will price your items for you. Good. Compared to what you would probably get for them if you sold them yourself on your driveway, you're going to be happy (even when you realize you're only getting half the amount they set). They will also sometimes come pick up your items if you need help. Buyers - the store is laid out pretty well and they seem to only take quality items that would sell, so you won't find a bunch of ugly donated junk. Some of the items are out of date, but still in good shape. You're probably not going to find some grossly under priced antique that you could flip at an auction, but if you need to fill up a room in your house - it's a good place to shop. Weekends seem to be busy for them, so I imagine their stock changes constantly. You're going to be paying higher prices than you would at garage sales or thrift stores, but the prices here are flexible and you're definitely saving money over buying new.
other This was my 1st spring Training baseball experience so I can't compare the ballpark with any other. However, as a newbie I can say that I appreciate the intimate setting. Every seat is a decent seat. Hubs and I had seat right behind home plate for less than $30. It's a really chill atmosphere. Feels like a college ball park.The concessions are priced fairly. The bathrooms were clean. I had a great time. See you next year!
other We were shopping at the Bass Pro Shop in Tempe and decided to go for ice cream to kill some time before dropping my parents off at the airport. I pulled out my iPad and 'yelped' ice cream. It brought up other options in the area and we chose Dairy Queen which was a few blocks away.As luck would have it there was no left turn onto Dobson and we ended up going East on the 20other the opposite direction of the Dairy Queen.  So I searched again and we came up with Yogurtland.  It wasn't luck after all but some ice cream higher power at work to bring us to our frozen yogurt oasis in Yogurtland.  Not only were the ingredients fresh and delicious but the price was reasonable as well. other of us each had a scrumptious & generously portioned sundae and our total bill was less than $20!We all enjoyed our selections.  One topping surprise was the Fruit Pebbles cereal my daughter put on her sundae.  The fruity crunch they added was delish!  Yogurtland was a home run!  Thanks For the Yelp!
other First off, I am not a science person. Unless social sciences counts, in which case, I have a bachelors degree. My boyfriend on the other hand was raised by two Phd holding physicists and studied electrical engineering in college. He has weird accelerometer-type machines in his garage and has conversations that would make the cast of the Big Bang Theory proud. Kudos to the Arizona Science Center for offering exhibits that appealed to the both of us.We started on the 4th floor at the Solarville exhibit which focused on energy, the environment, and conservation. It talked about individual household energy usage, and ways to reduce environmental impact. The 3rd floor had the Forces of Nature and Technology exhibits, which both offered interactive and informative displays. The 2nd floor was all about electricity, so naturally my electrical engineer bf showed off his knowledge. The coolest part of the museum for me was the first floor at the "All About Me" exhibit. It covers the systems of the human body and even has a stomach you can walk through and a giant nose that blows out objects. The neuroscience portion was very interesting, and I enjoyed taking the interactive memory tests.Admission was $14, not including special exhibits or films. We had a limited amount of time and didn't get to check out any of the extras (IMAX film, planetarium, pirate exhibit). We saw almost all of the museum in other and half hours. We were there in the early afternoon on a weekday, and it seemed like most of the school groups had cleared out by then.Will definitely be back, perhaps for the Adults Night Out. Nothing against kids, but I can only handle so many middle schoolers at time before I want to scream.
other This is one of  best libraries I have ever been to.  I live very close by and it is very easy to stop by to pick something up or drop something off.  This is always a must visit before road trips to California to pick up books for the adults and kids as well as DVD 's for the road trip.  We visit this location at least once a week and the kids love it.
other We went to the Science Center for their body exhibit and then walked around to find something to eat. We chose The Rose and Crown because it was close, not too fancy and the music pouring out was great. We ate out on the beautiful porch of this amazing house and although we don't drink, we were welcomed and enjoyed the experience. I asked the waiter for his dinner suggestion and went with it (fish and chips), my husband ordered the shepherds pie. Both were quite delicious. I even took the time to use the restroom and to see the inside of the restaurant and enjoyed the ambiance throughout the pub. I will definitely be back with friends to enjoy again.
other awesome and delicious place! good for groups!
other Well it was St. Patrick's day and I could not think of anywhere to go but here, that might be celebrating. Oh the were definately into it up in here! haha patrons and staff were both decked out for the day in green and with hats, tee-shirts, plastic jewlery and just about anything you can find related to the day.The crowd was happy and I talked to a lot more people than on the average stop in. The dining room and bar were both filled. The Irish music was filling the place, the green beer was flowing as one might expect at a discounted rate. There was a corn beef & cabbage plate special being offered up as well as the usual menu items and the Wed .40 cent wing deal they now have started. There was St Paddys day decoration and give aways from happy hour into the evening. A fun and lively pub it was. My only complaint was that drinks were all being served in limp little plastic cups; mixed drinks and the beer.
other we rode our bikes here today in search of a new place to try. the online menu looked like it had a few options for non-meat eaters (although it is very much a meat heavy menu). for an easter sunday lunch, it was very empty, not a good sign. but we had no wait and they easily passed the water glass test. our server was very attentive and checked on us throughout the meal without being overbearing. the decor is "country" but not like cracker barrel....more like neo farm dining. i had the blackened fish sandwich, which was cooked really well, nice and seared but juicy, topped with onion, pickles, tomatoes and butter lettuce. i had the jalpeno and cheese grits on the side and they were rich and creamy with just a slight hint of heat...nothing to burn your mouth. my wife had the tuna sandwich, which was also tasty and seared just right. she did have to navigate a big piece of fascia which is not that delectable, but it was her dish, not mine. her side of gigantic asparagus tasted wonderful. i would love to come back here and hope they are able to make it here. well worth the bike ride.
other I'm from New York, so you can bet the firs thing I asked everyone when I moved to Phoenix was "where should I get some good pizza?"  Everyone responded "Pizzeria Bianco!," but a few wise ones told me to avoid the crazy wait and check out Cibo.  Still haven't made it to Bianco, but why bother?  I've been to Cibo 3 times in the past few months and wouldn't have it any other way.The service has always been spectacular.  There's a good selection of beer and wine, and an almost impossible-to-choose-from selection of pizzas.  We're not talking New York thin-slice sauce-and-cheese, we're talking locally sourced ingredients and artful combination.  Perfect crust topped with the perfect combination of delicious meats, cheeses, and veggies galore.Your least favorite part of the meal will definitely be trying to pronounce the names of the pizzas.  Your favorite part of the meal might be the pizza, or it might be the ambiance (hard to decide between the cozy outside with live music and fire pit or the quaint inside that boasts everything downtown Phoenix is good at).  Go with a group of friends and stay a while.
other I've been meaning to try Humble Pie for a while, and as luck would have it this weekend I was in the right place at the right time and we decided to stop in. Rumors are true, everything is delicious. We shared the strawberry & gorgonzola salad, which was flavorful, light, and summery. Then we split the Schreiners Sicilian Sausage pizza. It was flavorful, spicy, and delicious. I will definitely be back to Humble Pie when I need a pizza fix.
other Yummy!Worth the wait. Yes, it is all the hype so get a drink, enjoy the scenery and munch on some fabulous pizza. Not one thing I wouldn't order. Have fun and have a slice for me!
other I feel sad to write this...but Vincent needs to improve things or his place will be only a past memory.  I'm ok with that based on the dinner I had there recently.The restaurant was packed...but with people who had Groupons...I only wish I had because my dinner would not have been 177.00.  Too much for a weak and sad plate of out of date food.We had the Foi Gras, small portion and so/so:(...Duck chimichangas they were decent. The wild boar was a tiny serving...we were fine with that because it was tough and difficult to chew.  It was accompanied with a hospital style vegetable medly of green beans with carrot shreds and minute white rice.  We also had trout..it was covered in a heavy white sauce (French) and had the same veg medly and white rice...seriously like the hospital food...or a big banquet service.  It was edible...but not great...We each had a glass of wine.  No dessert for us...it was hot in there and the arches and decor reminded me of a taco bell.  I wouldn't even go back if it was a free meal:(
other I have memories that make my mouth water.  My mother calls me everytime she passes through Phoenix to ask me where this place is.  She tells her friends in Los Angeles to come here if they have business or family trips to Phoenix.  They all rave after their experience.  The fry bread house is as authentic as it gets.  Indian tacos, fry bread with sugar, and oh my god--the red chili stew.  I think I just drooled a little on my keyboard.  The place does get a little cramped during meal times, but we used to take ours to go and sit in the park after a bike ride down Central and picnic away and then do our best to ride it off afterwards so we weren't wallowing in the guilt of our deep fried pleasures.  Make sure they are open before you make the trek, they have funky hours.
other So, I went because of all the hype. Immediately, realized how overrated it was. The ambiance is like a Chilis but trying to be mexican.
other Currently having a liquidation sale, but it's not really worth the trip.  I found that most books were cheaper at Amazon then the sale price.  A few were even cheaper at Barnes and Noble then the liquidation sale price!  Which just made me say to myself well that's probably why you're going out of business try some competitive pricing!  The place is an absolute disaster they've moved a lot so the sales staff doesn't even know where everything is.  Also the place just smells dirty and old, it's very unwelcoming.  It's really no surprise to me they couldn't get customers before.
3 I thought the place had a lot to offer with the atmosphere and the ingredients used in the all of the dishes.  I only thought that the menu spoke louder than the dish.
other I absolutely HATE chain restaurants!Although in this case, I have to make an exception.  I'm really into the food at Buca.I used to live in the SF Bay Area, and I had to wait damn near other hours to eat at the Buca located at downtown SF.  I now live in Chandler, AZ and the first time I visited a Buca here, I didn't have to wait any longer than 30 seconds.  I usually have a standard list of items that I order for the entire table when my family goes to Buca:BruschettaLinguine Frutti DiMareMargherita PizzaPepperoni PizzaChicken MarsalaI also frequent other independently owned Italian restaurants, but Buca holds a special place in my heart, and my stomach.  They have a signature flavor to their dishes.  The best waiter in the world, Lee works at this particular one.  Request to be seated at his station and give him a big tip!
other This pizza always tasted great but lately I feel like they have cheapened their ingredients. I realize its $other pizza but it just tastes different to me now. If it weren't for the flavored crust I would not come back. But the main reason I have not returned to Hungry Howie's is because the last time I wanted to place a pick up order I was turned down. I asked for a reason and was told that they received a very large company order and they were not taking regular orders at that moment. You'd think they would be able to accommodate everyone even if a large order was placed.
3 Two stars because there isnt a drive thru.. and Im a lazy American who forgot that when you live abroad you walk for coffee and your needs.. Three stars because the peeps working are as friendly as it gets.. but the sugar/condiment bar is dirty.. clean it up Starbucks!
other Mucho Gusto es mucho mierda. Let me say first, that the place is cute, the staff is friendly, and the salsa is good. There. I'm not being a total jerk. The food, however, left much to be desired. I couldn't find much to like about my chicken tacos- they were ok, but the meat didn't have much flavor, there was no cheese, and they were pretty stingy with the guacamole and pico. What really got me was that they didn't come with rice and beans. Instead, I got a lovely pile of cheap bagged romaine coated in some sort of caesar-ish dressing. Sure, there were a few cubes of cheese and a tomato slice (A slice!) on top, but come on. $1other for a couple of naked tacos and a pile of romaine? For that much, they could have at least picked the white core parts of the lettuce out of my salad. Or, I dunno, sprinkled a little cheese on the tacos?The story was much the same with the fish tacos, only the salad was different. The enchiladas seemed to be a hit, and those are served with rice and beans. the vegan at the table ordered a side of rice and beans for her meal, and they aren't kidding about it being a side. I think my cat's food bowl is bigger. They charge $other per bowl if you want more chips. I know $other isn't a big deal, but it's just the principle. I already felt ripped off from the entree, so the extra charge for the chips just made it worse. Needless to say, I won't be going back. There are far better choices closer to home.
other I was seated at the bar. A very nice young man was working the bar an provided good conversation.I was offered a DELICIOUS chicken, bacon, bleu cheese amuse. Yum!I ordered a pine nut pesto pizza, which wad delivered by the chef! :)The crust was perfect! Thick enough for structure and substance, but thin enough to "hide" behind the flavors of tomato and pine nut pesto.The cheese was also just right.Delicious!I also had the chicken panini, which was fantastic! The bread was a bit hard, but I think I was too busy talking and let it sit too long.All in all I'd definitely recommend L'Academie if you're in that area of Scottsdale.
other The food was absolutely delicious.  Was very surprised in finding a good Asian restaurant here in Phoenix.  We had the papaya salad with soft shell crab, Phnom Penh noodle soup, and the lehong noodles.  All were delicious and very SE Asian.  I could not believe how great the food was.  But the best part was the grass jelly drink - it brought me back to my childhood.  Can't wait to try the other dishes here.  A definite must try here in Phoenix.
other Dr Fish is an ok oral surgeon.  However, his financial practices are shady.  He gave us a high estimate for surgery, 6k; we had to pay 4k before the surgery.  He then lowered the estimate after the surgery but refused to credit our card; we had insurance that paid 2k.  Two months later, we received a check for a small amount of the overage.  Their office person told me they dont do credit card credits.  I then called our insurance company and learned Dr. Fish had received $1800 more from us than the insurance co allowed in Dr Fish's agreement with the co.  Now we have to go fight him for the refund. His office person said, oh, insurance co's dont like to pay.  Hmmm--why contract with them then?  I would say, look elsewhere!
other Got together with Mike C. to go out to a Thanksgiving Buffet today.  We tried for Golden Corral down the street in Gilbert but the line was way outside, so we came up here where there was also a wait, but shorter.  It was good, as always, but there were some negatives this time:*  The soups:  There was an ordinary Corn Chowder, a weak Cream of Broccoli, & ordinary Chicken Noodle.  They should have done better than this for Thanksgiving.*  There was no cottage cheese.  (They don't always have it, but at these prices they should have some today.)*  There was turkey, but breast meat only & no dressing!*  Over at the dessert bar there was no hot fudge (& it looked not as if it had run out, but rather that they just didn't offer any today).*  There were no sundae cups.  I had to go over & get a soup bowl to make a sundae.*  There was Hot Lava Cake (or "Hot Fudge Cake" I think they call it here), but it was sorely lacking in lava!Thus, it's down to other Stars for this restaurant that wasn't as good as it should have been for the money.Thanksgiving Buffet $12.99/$12.49 Sr.
other Busy right after school which is to be expected...Wasn't very clean which is disappointing, especially for an ice cream parlor. We stopped in to try the new soft serve ice cream with sprinkles that turn the ice cream a new color. Don't know if the boy behind the counter was stingy or what, but the kids got only a couple of sprinkles that didn't even cover the ice cream which was disappointing considering they charge for them. All in all wouldn't visit this location again. We prefer the one closer to home :)
other What has happened to the Coffee Plantation? I've been out of the Valley for 8 yrs. and the Coffee Plantation was always such a good place for food, bakery items, and of course coffee. On my last visit the store was dirty, the full menu of food was gone, and the coffee was burnt. I went to the Biltmore and alas that location was gone. Where did my old Coffee Plantation go?
other I agree with Tracy, my wife and I are big fans of Fiorella's. Definitely a treasure for the northwest valley. The service is great and the food is delicious. Prices are a bit higher than other dining options in the area, but the friendly people and yummy food are worth it.
other The staff is friendly. But the physical hotel itself itself is comparable to a other star motel. The Holiday Express I stayed at is better than this. Priceline tricked me when I requested for a other star and indicated that this was a other star in name your own price.Cons:1) They have cactus in the parking lot where when I got home late, it was dark, poorly lit lot, and opened my car door, step out of the car, and step on to cactus severely injuring my foot to where I can not walk anymore. Who puts low cactus in a dimly lit parking lot where when you get out of a car, someone can step on it? Being injured on vacation is no fun and very painful!2) hotel room and property is old, like from the 1980s though the front desk boy told me that the rooms were newly renovated3) Given the previous reviews I asked for a quiet room, but was given a room where the squeeking and thumping and wall shaking, woke me up at other in the morning. The neighbors flushing the toilet, showering, and running water can all be heard.4) the bathroom door is so jammed that it requires both hands, all of my body wait and a few minutes of wrestling with it to open/close it5) Requested a single bed, however upon arrival, was told that it would be 30/extra a night for a single bed instead of other doubles6) 80s style tube TV 7) pink 80s decor8) worn down bed with body dent in it9) wifi costs 9.99/for 2other hours even though its signal is only other bar10) AC blasts loudly on and off during the night11) curtains are cut half way so tons of light comes in to the room in the morning. pros: 1) location2) staff smiles and says hi3) cleaning staff does a good job
other We were craving Mexican food and since we were in the area I decided to check on my trusty yelp app on my phone to find a perfect food joint to check out.  Sure enough, it came through for us and told us about this little gem tucked away in an area I had been several times but had never noticed it before.  I am so very glad I tried it as it will now be my go-to place for Mexican food.  The food is delicious and fresh and reasonably priced.  The guacamole is a must try and the carne asada is so good.  If you're in the mood for Mexican and in the area, I would definitely recommend this place.
other Thai food is one of my favorite types of cuisines. I have been going to Thai Rama for over other years now, and they are always consistent! this place is a little, hole in the wall type. (those are usually the best)Whenever I am having a thai fix I usually order the same items. Sometimes different... But not always. OK..1. Thai tea... the best in the valley! 2. Pad thai with chicken... level other - other is usually med spice but to some ppl its very spicy... you can always lower the number to a other or other and it'll still be just as good.3. Yellow pork or chicken coconut curry with potatoes, onions, carrots, & pineapple.... level other again.... my fave4. There's one more beef dish that is absolutely delish! But, I forgot the name. Basically all it is, is thick rice noodles and thinly sliced beef stir fried.. Kind of like a chow fun but better!Oh and I would also like to add that they have a very friendly waitstaff and pretty good service.If you like Thai, check this place out!!!
other Had lunch at Bliss again ... still yummy as always! This time I had the ceasar salad and their shoe string  parmesan cheese fries. I still recommend this place for lunch or dinner.
other Cafe Lalibela is my absolute favorite Ethiopian resteraunt in the greater Phoenix area. Located in a small shopping plaza near downtown Tempe, this humble little place packs a whole lot of flavor with their authentic Ethiopian fare. I love their braised meats (particularly the beef and lamb dishes) and your vegetarian friends will rejoice with Lalibela's amazing selection of veggie sides. My mouth is watering just thinking about their potatoes, carrots, and cabbage dish as well as their carrot and green beans. Their spicy lentils are probably my favorite lentils ever, and their injera (thin spongey bread, sort of like naan) is absolutely perfect. The super nice family that owns and operates this place are great and they even offer some great Ethiopian coffee, tea, and beers. One of the only things I really miss about Tempe.
other I met up with a friend for dinner here the other night. It's a little far from me, unfortunately; if this was within a few miles of me, I'd be here a -lot-.  For starters, the place is easy to miss. It's a hole in the wall. It's very small inside, only a few tables; definitely consider takeout.   That said, if it's not busy, don't be afraid to stay. We ate in; when there was a significant lull in the crowd, the girl behind the counter came both to clear our tables and to deliver a second item I ordered a bit later in the evening. I wish I'd been carrying cash, there is a tip jar by the register, and I would have loved to have left something for that.   The food...ah, the food. Great bang for the buck. Have I had better tacos? Yes. Once, handmade by a Mexican immigrant my mother was good friends with, as we joined her for a family dinner. In restaurants? No. This is good Mexican street food, small hand made corn tortillas with flavorful, moist meat on them, and some warm salsa on top. Lovely. They even offer lengua, for those that like it, a very nice touch.   As others have said, the rice is very good; I wasn't actually that fond of the beans though.   Is this place worth going 20 minutes out of your way? Unfortunately, no, hence the other star. But is it worth going to if you're already nearby? Yes, very much yes.
other great food, freaky good service, fantastic atmosphere.  Highly recommend sitting on patio, inside looked a bit loud.  Patio is fantastic, it is one of a few in Phoenix where it doesn't overlook a parking lot.  This is my new favorite place to take visitors.
3 RIPI drive by here every day but looked over and saw the place dark inside and the signage ripped down. They never did quite recover from the roof collapse thing. Was the only Vietnamese place by my work, now sadly, there are none. They should have offered Banh Mi for lunch. Woulda-coulda-shoulda.
other Went and got some delicious Boba today. Mango and Strawberry Banana. Guy behind the counter is very welcoming and friendly. :)My choice place for quick to go Boba.
other Poor service-small portions-pricey
other EXCELLENT!  What a fun time we had.  Hubby and I went out for my bday celebration and were so glad that we did.  What a fun and comfortable experience.  We walked in and were greeted right away.  We had made reservations but there was absolutely no reason to.  It was a Monday night and really @ 7:30 there wasn't a whole lot going on.  Alec was our server.  We opted to sit in the bar area.  Same menu available.  We started off with the Haas Guac and the Green Chile Stew.  We initially made the mistake thinking that the stew was going to be like the kind @ Roaring Fork.  It's not.  They would do themselves a favor if they called it hash.  I suppose hash is not as appealing as stew.  Nonetheless it was good.  The little fry breads that they give were not my favorite but it was good with the chips that came with the guac.  I had the pork tenderloin and hubs had the mac and cheese with chicken.  Both good.  Really good.  It would have been a five star review but there was something weird tasting in my diet coke.  Like soap or something.  Hubby thought maybe it was because they probably didn't sell a whole lot of soda product. I dunno.  Could have been the straw, the glass, syrup ratio to C02. And by far which is probably the best part of the restaurant.  THE BEST CHAIRS in the world.  So comfy.  So plush.  You could sit there for hours and never leave.  IF you had them in your home you would never leave.  EVER!!!!
other I was excited to check out Sleepy Dog after seeing all of it's other and 5-star reviews, and finally made it in. I must say...both beers I enjoyed were delicious. Establishment itself is small but unique and modern, and their whole theme around dogs rocks. The only drawback, is they do not serve food....well, the whole reason I went here was to meet up with a friend for dinner and a beer or two. I was shocked at this. We ended up having a pizza delivered from a pizza place down the street, which went well with our beers. One great thing, was they have a ton of flat screens all around. One had a corny late 80's action movie playing which was very entertaining, and something you don't experience everyday. All in all, I did like Sleeping Dog, and would like to go back. I saw the popcorn maker as we left! Beer was just as good/better than the other breweries in the area.
other I LOVE this place. I have been craving their Baked Spaghetti Pie again for other years and I finally got it today since I'm back for a business trip! I remember pretty much everything on their menu is fresh and delicious. Their prices are great too! Very polite staff.
other I have been to slippery pig a half a dozen times in the last few months since moving in nearby. I have nothing but great things to say about the shop. They are friendly and courteous and I haven't experienced any of that bike snobbery that comes with LBS. I am glad I found a local shop with great service
other I've been hearing about these cheesecakes from my husband and his incessant twitter following and I was really excited to try some of the goods at the market this past Saturday.We finally woke up early enough on a Saturday morning to hit up Matt's and then peruse the market before it got too hot.  We made our way over to the cheesecake table and then debated between 10 or so flavors.  He had key lime and chocolate chip out to sample and I decided to try the key lime.  I was amazed at how natural it tasted.  There was nothing artificial about it, it just tasted exactly like it should.  These are very good, very simple cheesecakes.  I ultimately went with the peanut butter chocolate chip which is extremely tasty.  There are a bunch of different sizes to choose from, all at very fair prices.  YUMMY!
other Ohhh this is the best place ever! Every thing I have ordered has been delish!
other Finally a raw food cafe that isn't in Tempe.  Love their drinks and raw food menu.  Just wish their prices would come down bit.    This is the type of place I could eat at everyday.  I know it is good because the afternoon lull doesn't happen to me when I eat here.    I do NOT go daily, due to pricing, but I would like too, because I would simply live longer eating here.  Your body buzzes with clean energy (non-caffeine) after eating here.  If you are a person who wants to be nice to your body.  Splurge and give your body what it craves....Enzymes.    Who knew raw food was the answer to avoiding afternoon coffee.......?
other Dr Natalie is a compassionate, empathetic, caring DC. She listens, takes her time with you and always strives not only to make you feel better, but to keep you feeling better. Her new location is adorable. I highly recommend her!
other Yummy!!Went with my best friend last night for our weekly date and had a great meal!  We enjoyed the sushi menu but everything looked quite delicious.  I LOVED the welcoming sushi chefs and beautiful aquariums.  Here is a rundown of the food...Edamame: solid...can't really screw that one upPhilly: Great distribution of cream cheese!  I hate when sushi places over do it on the Philly...California: Solid but could have been a bit creamer and with some spicy sauce Some kind of Latino roll: Skip it...weird texture insideScallop roll: YummmGreat experience and so far maybe the best sushi I have come across in AZ.  I will keep you posted
3 Had breakfast here on a Saturday morning in July.  I ordered the Spanish Scramble.  It was good.  I don't have much to say.  It's close to home but it's just okay.  Still looking for my go-to breakfast joint.
3 I had been craving sushi steadily for about two weeks, so I decided to try somewhere new. This place happens to be just across the street from my work and the reviews on here were a vote of confidence. I had the cherry blossom roll and rainbow roll, shared edamame, and hot green tea. The cherry blossom roll was good, not amazing, but good. The fish was fresh enough, and I did like the eel sauce drizzled on it. The rainbow roll was much less rainbow than I'm used to. The rainbow roll did have a bit of a fishy taste, and the whitefish on it was a pale yellowish brown color, and not as moist as it could have been. The crumbled macadamia nuts were and interesting and kind of fun garnish. The edamame was tasty, not over cooked, but could have used a little more salt. The green tea was boiling hot, with the kind of walnutty aftertaste you get from good green tea, I was disappointed it came in a single glass, not in a tea pot diffuser with a teacup like at most restaurants.My girlfriend had pork katsu, the sauce drizzled on it was sweet and vinegary, but not too overwhelming. Gauging from the fact that she ate all of it I would assume it was pretty good. The salad that came with it was a bit strange, iceberg lettuce and a cream sesame dressing. The miso soup on the side was better than the little packets I get at the store, but didn't taste home made. It was not too salty, but the tofu must have been dehydrated, it was in tiny little shriveled squares on the bottom of the bowl. The waitstaff was very attentive and friendly. It wasn't too busy when we went, about 5pm. The music was typical pop music, but thankfully unlike some places (RA for instance) its not blaring. I would say its definately not the best sushi I've ever had, not even the best I've had in arizona, but it was ok. The rainbow rolls at kobe are better.
other I love me some Dobson Ranch.  As far as municipals in the Valley are concerned, this is as good as it gets (Aguila is a close second).  No overbearing marshalls.  Rates that top out at $28 in the winter.  Above average range and practice area, including two large putting greens.  Cheap pitchers of beer.  A long-time cart lady who will spray your face with water in the summer!  As far as the course itself, this is not typical AZ golf - there are no cacti, only tree-lined fairways and some water sprinkled throughout to pose as threats.    But there are birdies to be had, and lots of them; #1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 1other and 18 are the best chances in my experience (I consider this my home course).  The greens are usually pretty moderate speed to slow - this is grainy bermuda, not some hybrid or bent grass, so prepare to run the putts into the back of the hole.  #other is my favorite hole, a short-par other that gives you the chance to hit over a tree left and drive the narrow fairway, leaving you a long to mid-iron into an elevated green that slopes toward you.  #8 is a formidable challenge if you have the tendency to block (or slice, as may be the case) the ball from time-to-time, as your ball will face a watery grave.  #16 is a tricky tree-lined hole with a tight driving area and doglegs right.  And finally, #18, a short par other that is easily reachable and where a par feels like a bogey.  A scant 6600 yds from the blue tees (but rarely plays it's full length), there are some low scores out there.A great course, value, practice area, and recently renovated restaurant and bar - other stars.
other This is a great place to go for a glass of wine and appetizers with your girlfriends. My girlfriends and I went there to celebrate one of our birthdays. We sat on the patio by the fireplace. Our waitress was awesome she let us try as many samples of wines that wanted to. The wines are very good and pretty inexpensive. As for the appetizers they were just ok. The bruschetta is good, but the spinach artichoke dip was tasteless. This place stands out for its ambiance, great tasting wine and good service!
other I am a harsh critic when it comes to Mexican Food.  My good buddy Paul talked me into coming to this place.  When I asked him what to expect, he was correct in saying: "Don't worry dude, just get the green on green with a taco on the side and watch the hood life unfold."  He was CORRECT!  This place is in the hood and they open at 10:30am for lunch.  The lines get long at about 11am.  They have a video game from the 80s while you wait. They serve drinks in THE CAN so I would suggest getting a 32oz thirstbuster beforehand.  If you go in the summer, you will be HOT in the summer heat as the only place to sit are at the picnic tables located OUTSIDE of course.  If you try to alter your order, you will be SCOWLED AT by the cashier.  However, if you treat her with respect, she will say something in spanish to the old heavy hispanic lady in the kitchen who stirs the chili and the fat lady will either NOD or shake her head.  All in all - a great place to eat!!
other Not impressed. I'd rather have a Big Mac and fries at McDonald's. Can't understand why some rave about it.
other This is one of the only places in Phoenix that carries legitimate book binding supplies like book cloth and all sorts of decorative binding papers (unlike the decorative kind for scrapbooking). I love that I can order online, and then they will call me when my order is ready and I can just head on down to Tempe to pick my stuff up.While I haven't taken any of their classes, they look pretty awesome. I have had experiences with old letter press techniques, and this place offers classes in it. I think I'm going to have to sign up!
other This mall has all the upscale shopping that you will ever need. Just make sure you come here with your credit cards in check as you are bound to fall in love with something when you come here.They have some of the best department stores in my opinion, and if you're looking for that perfect dress for any occasion, you have tons of options to choose from.I love how clean and perfect this mall is!
other 2.other starsThe short: Open and clean setup with friendly staff, but it's basically just-ok carby kid food.The long: On the south side of Thomas, just west of 44th St., turning left into the lot can be a bear during peak traffic, but it's otherwise fairly accessible for people driving in from the west or walking up, like I did. The inside is wide open and clean with plenty of chairs and tables that were just a little too cluttered around the restaurant floor plan. Otherwise, it doesn't stick out much from other fast food joints. I went during the middle of a somewhat busy lunch period, and who seemed to be the head cashier loudly greeted just about everyone who walked in the front door on the other side of the restaurant. My cashier was friendly and quick, though he seemed a tiny bit frazzled by the small rush. I ordered The Box combo and a lemonade to go and headed back to my office a short 5-minute walk away. I hoped the freshly squeeze lemonade would be awesome, even if they did charge only about a dime more than fountain drinks for a regular. Although I could taste the lemon, the drink was so sweet, it may as well have been from a mix or carton. The Box comes with a small container of sweet coleslaw dressed in a lot of mayo, a slab of soft-in-the-inside, perfectly browned-on-the-outside toast, somewhat slightly crisp, thin crinkle cut fries, a container of Cane sauce (which tastes like burger sauce), and, of course, four chicken strips. Unless you're me and you get only three chicken strips . . . or two smallish chicken strips and one big chicken strip that maybe they counted as two, but really, halfway through the meal, you're so carbed-out full that you don't miss anything aside from the extra dollar you paid for that extra chicken strip. The strips were fine. It was real chicken, and true to advertising, it was fresh. Sort of crispy, but not as crispy as I'd hoped, or even expected. Tender and moist enough to not be bad. But not special. All of it was pretty one-note. I can't even tell you what part of the meal I liked best . . . maybe the toast. Coincidentally, every time I took a bite of that toast, I'd think, "This is the most random slice of toast ever. What's it even doing here?" So, it's fine if you're like me and want to try every new eatery that opens near my home or office and appreciate the novelty of places like this, but personally, I won't be making a return visit.Edit: I almost threw my drink cup away before I noticed the giveaway pull tab on it--I won a free slice os Texas toast! How do you like them apples? =)
3 I thought this bagel shop was ok. The bagel sandwich I got was relatively lackluster. I think I will stick to Einsteins for the time being.
other For so many reasons, Costco is top notch but I'm going to review their Opto department. They are equally as stellar! Dr. Tieu is super friendly, knowledgeable and very approachable. The retail part has the best pricing on contacts, frames and lenses compared to any competitor. Lucky me they take my insurance and my yearly supply of contacts came to a big fat $0 after rebates. Always ask about rebates for contacts, both the Dr office and the retail desk will usually have some that you can combine!
other Ok, I'm new to the whole Thai food thing, and I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy food, so take this review for what it is....I was told by plenty of uber-Thai food fans that this place was the bee's knees, but I wasn't too impressed. i kept it pretty standard ordering just pad thai noodles with tofu and iced tea. the iced tea was killer (i find that at most thai places, what is it with the iced thai tea phenomenon??)the flavor was pretty bland, i have to say. it was the right amount of spicy, but just still bland, no bueno. plus, for a thai place, they did not cook the tofu well, it was totally bland, too.i was disappointed, but i will probably go one more time because you never know if you just catch a restaurant on an off day. it was super busy on a tuesday lunch hour, too, but we got in and out pretty quickly, so it's good for a work lunch.***update 1/08I'm glad I made that disclaimer in my original review, because I've been back three times (only for p/u) and it's now one of my top thai places. Maybe I was bitter because my editor took me there for my year review to tell me the paper couldn't afford more than 3 percent raise (on a reporter's salary, that's about 3other cents - you can imagine my bitterness). Hahahaha. I'm still not 100 percent a fan of their tofu, but the other entrees I've tried are not as bland as my OG visit.It's a great spot to pick up even if I just walk in and order because, what I assume is the owner (a middle-aged Asian women who dresses professional), is SOOO nice and helpful* with the menu and there is a small bar (really small, like 4-other seats) where I can order a draft and hang out for the 10-1other minutes it takes to make my order.*definition of "soooo nice and helpful": She answered all our questions regarding level of spiciness and confusion over which entrees included noodles or rice patiently and with a smile; suggested one of the most delicious fried banana/ice cream desserts I've ever had; and, one time she realized we weren't finished with our beers when our tightly packaged food was place on the bar, so she spent five minutes undoing the tie to poke holes in the to-go boxes so the steam could escape and not make our food "sweaty". RIGHT ON!that definitely earned them an extra star for service! so... more like 3 and half***************************i'm bumping up another half star because their stellar customer service is dead-ion consistent every single time i come here. i highly recommend the Yupha's House fried rice with tofu - flavorful and not too greasy. and big points for being able to order every single item on the menu as spicy as you want it.
other I'm a gelato purist, so Chill is right up my alley. You don't have a million flavor choices, but the ones they have are classics done right, so there is no need. The same lady is always working when I go, and she is very friendly and upbeat. They haven't yet perfected the multi-flavor ratio in one cup, but I'm sure that will improve, and I'm a huge fan of anything with a punch card. So far my favorite gelato spot in the Valley :)
other Well, I live down the street from this park at 4other Monroe so it's just a block away from me. And it's a refreshing place given the surroundings of a semi urban jungle, that being in lieu of the handful of bums that live there shouting profanities at every passerby as if you've had a life long vendetta with them. For the longest while I'd referred to the jellyfish but after the curiosity got the best of me I'd researched that it emulates the desert winds which cost about other million dollars to make. WTH is up with AZ and spending their taxpayers money on giant jellyfish at parks and teacups on freeways. However, the park is a refreshing patch of green color in such a monochromatic city. Plus they host cute little musical shows and food trucks, & who can pass up chilling in the grass listening to some jams while chowing down on some delicious, greasy truck food.
3 The facility is very clean and I got in and out quick.  However, the staff lacks personality and friendliness.
other We ate here for the first time this morning.  The food was better than average, the portions were generous and the service was both fast and friendly.  After seeing that their sausage gravy is made from scratch every day, I had no option but to try it.  It didn't disappoint.  It was creamy and delicious but not overly greasy or heavy like sausage gravy can so easily be.  The omlette my husband and I shared was tasty and the veggies were fresh and plentiful.  Our daughter's pancakes were fluffy and perfectly cooked and very tasty.  Anytime we do a sleepover at grandma's in north Scottsdale, this is a sure bet for breakfast!
other Best Thai food I've eaten in the Phoenix area.
other SOOOOOOOOO MUCH FUN! The 3 of us went to Superstition Farm for their tour last Saturday. No, we didn't have any kids with us but we may have had a better time than most of the kids.The beginning is a bit dry. You're in the "classroom" for a while learning about random facts related to diary cows.  Moo.  After that, it's a hay ride.  Girls, let me give you one tip - Make sure you wear long pants or shorts that are long.  Hay is very uncomfortable under your butt if there isn't enough padding.  Anyway, the hay ride was entertaining but the best part had yet to come.Once the hayride was over, the "tour" was officially over.  But everyone stuck around to check out the petting zoo. The animals were all so friendly and we got to feed them as well.  There was a hodgepodge of creatures from a young cow to sheep to rabbits and even a turkey.  Yum...just kidding.In addition, there's a black lab on the premise that was amazing.  This dog would make an incredible soccer player.  His reaction time is unbelievable - any team would be happy to have him as a goalie.After the animal bonding, we went to try flavored milk.  Mine was butterscotch flavored and it was just ok.  I was disappointed that the milk wasn't fresh from the farm but I guess it's not legal to serve unprocessed milk.  Since we had a Groupon, we also had a chance to try Udder Delights ice cream. At $2.50 each, I would never pay for them individually. But seeing that it was included in my "deal," we enjoyed them a lot.Don't be embarrassed if you don't have kids.  Trust me, adults can enjoy Superstition Farm too.
other My friend kept telling me how good their lunches are... I tried it, but it didn't do anything for me.  The sandwich tasted like something you can get at Safeway, but twice the price.  For being called a Purveyor of Fine Foods, I expected the food to taste like not just any ordinary sandwich. What I had:Ham, cheese with portobello mushrooms on a panini with other sides of pasta, one was parmesan and the other was macaroni. Maybe it was the panini bread. I think the parmesan pasta was made there, but I know for sure the macaroni was not made there, it tasted like something I had at a picnic which was in a carton. It wasn't anything to brag home about. I found out the head chef made my sandwich... keep him in the kitchen and away from the customers, no personality whatsoever. I asked for his suggestion, and his reaction was "anythings good." Normally, when I go to AJ's, I go for their desserts. Their desserts are fabulous and you can get individual servings at a reasonable price.  I can take an assortment home and have them for later. Our company does use them for their catering and I've had many compliments on their dishes, but pass on the lunches.
3 I have been by this spot many times and I needed a place to eat lunch so I stopped in... I entered the restaurant and was seated right away. But then I sat there for a good 10 minutes and watched the workers walk around  then I got to see the owners little kid decide she was going to sit with the consumers in the booth a head of me... Then the kid started crying and it just does not need to happen I was kind of shocked please leave your kids at home if they are not working at the restaurant.  I ended up getting up and asking the staff if I could just get the lunch buffet. I got a bit of everything to try I enjoyed the rice and the chicken dishes... The fish dishes on the other hand not so good the fish puffs were cold and not good and the one fish dish super fishy tasteing. The bread was really good that came with the meal... So all in all I would say I will not be going back anytime soon nothing to write home about.
other Yikes.  The only reason this place gets other stars instead of other is because I think their Baja chicken burrito is super tasty &  their Mango Salsa.Cons:The place is dirty (dont take my word, read the other reviews)The employees are always bullshitting until they rudely ask you what you want to order.The employees never offer suggestions, which may be an English Language barrier.The front door handle was broken my last time I went in here. Unreal.The burritos are likley to squirt and get extremely messy on the last few bites....sick.  Dont eat in the car unless you have a blanket in your lap, gross. If Im craving a burrito, I will likely just go to the Chipotle across the street and wait in line for 1other mins VS this place....I think the only way Ill come back to this location is strait up steal their salsa and limes from their salsa bar.This place would be better if they got friendlier harder working employees that actually cleaned the place up a bit.
other New N. Scottsdale location, Baaaaaaad!  The were 10 staff members milling around and there was no manager on sight.  $10.00 for a mediocre burger, with an uncooked, tasteless bun not large enough to encompass all the arugula.  They forgot the sauce, which apparently is the main ingredient.  The upgrades are ridiculous.  $1.00 here for cheese on an already "well priced" burger (btw Flemings blue cheese/bacon burger $6, best in town), $5,00 here for fries.  C'mon.  And, it's the same two hispanic guys, who don't have any idea about chef inspired food, cooking in the kitchen as every other restaurant, there is no chef For the price, you want to see the chef/owner representing, especially at a new location, and, you want competent staff who treats you as #1, and not their conversing with the other staff members as #1, and you want to enjoy what is supposed to be one of the best burgers in town!  What a disappointment.  The lack of top down management care and supervision carries through in all elements of the poor experience.  Take a pass.
other The food here was great! Wish there was more indoor seating, but the seating both indoor and outside is nice, live music sometimes, nice decor.  I've tried a few of the specialty drinks, some are good some are so/so but isn't it always that way? Just preferences.  The prices are a bit high, but the portions are worth it, we can split a meal typically.  The Deserts are awesome too!
3 A buddy of mine takes me to this place for dinner, usually, and once for breakfast. It's an interesting place. As others have noted, be prepared to wait a while for service and don't be afraid to go get your waiter if you're feeling abandoned. Also, there may be a wait for a table, and the environment is loud, so be prepared to shout a bit if it's busy. They have beer-tasting on certain nights. I did not partake, but my Dad (who was visiting AZ) did. The food varies in quality (or perhaps just varies in quality of recipe?). My Orange Table friend and I shared a 'special' pork chop dish, and that was pretty blah. However, I highly recommend their grilled cheese sandwich on some sort of yummy bread (the lower end cheese sandwich ~ I have yet to try the fancy one). As for breakfast, I don't recall it being particularly spectacular, but I think it was better than your average diner breakfast. I may have to go back to try again... The flavored iced coffee seems very evil and full of calories, but it is really quite good. That did stand out!Orange Table is recommended if you want a place to chill and chat with your friends. Just try to find out what others are eating so that you pick something good from the menu. : )
other I think they need to hire a better chief; the food doesn't taste right.My mom said she can teach them how to cook for free.
other Over the last other years or so, I've eaten lunch at Dilly's Deli a couple dozen times. The location is excellent, as it is near my office, and the interior décor is clean, modest, and charming. The music seems to vary, but on today's trip, it appeared to be a mix of oldies and jazzy easy listening. While I've never had to wait for a table to clear, seating can be limited during lunch hours. The service is friendly and quick and the menu offerings plentiful and interesting. Vegetarians will find a handful of options here, though it is likely you can request to omit meat from any sandwich or salad. Carrying Boar's Head ingredients is a plus, however the way their sandwiches are assembled and the ratio of ingredients used simply doesn't work for me. Oftentimes, I find my sandwich has a bulge of deli meat in the center and much less (and sometimes none at all) toward the outer parts nearing the crust. It has been my experience that the wraps are not treated this way, though the only wrap I've tried (Mexi) lacked flavor and tasted processed. I've eaten one salad at Dilly's - the Greek - and, while it is tasty, I discovered a dead fly in it halfway through and haven't ordered a salad there since. As other reviewers have reported, the soups aren't as piping hot as I'd like, though the variety and additional "daily soup" is appreciated. The bread is deliciously soft, warm, flavorful, and large - ideal for accompanying a soup or salad. If you're accustomed to filling up on a sandwich made with normal-sized slices, I suggest ordering a half sandwich so you can sample a side of soup, salad, or dessert as well. All sandwiches are served with a pickle spear.The cookies and brownies get other stars on their own.Today I gave Dilly's another shot and ordered a new menu item, the Red Bird, on wheat. Personally, I'm not a fan. The Blazin' Buffalo, Dilly Bird, and Smokey Mountain boast far better flavor combinations, IMO. Also, my pickle spear had a hair on it.Dilly's is a bit pricier than its nearby competition (All whole sandwiches are $6.99), though a reasonable price if shared.Overall, this is a higher quality sandwich shop than Subway, Blimpie, and the like. Unfortunately, the fly and hair experiences combined with the bread/meat ratio issue guarantee I will not return.
other I have a cooking problem- I can't do it. However, I loved coming to Entrees to Go to make our meals. My husband bought a Groupon for this place and we decided to try it out. It was a wonderful experience, and that means a lot coming from me since I am not a fan of cooking. I love the concept of Entrees to Go. You prepare your meal at this place and bring them home in a baggie.  Meals ready to cook and no mess in my kitchen = awesomeness! Everything you need to know to prepare your food is explained and if you have any questions they are answered immediately. The only downfall...The price w/o a Groupon is a little pricey. Three full size entrees (each entree serving 4-6) is regularly $80. It's great if you work full-time and don't have time to cook on your own but it's a little high for my pocketbook. However, if money wasn't a factor I would cook every meal at Entrees to Go. Loved it!
other This is a super cute restaurant with a simple yet delicious menu. They stick to basics which I love. They also have a vintage items that you can admire and purchase. Its a great place if you want a quick, simple, cheap yet delicious meal. Their shakes are amazing as well as their potato salad. YUM! If you are in the area, check it our for sure!
other We had brunch at El Chorro today and it was wonderful. The patio was comfortable with the umbrellas and heaters. The service was outstanding. The food was delicious. I had the creme brulee french toast - it was carb/sugar heaven. Everyone else enjoyed their food. The eggs benedict came out perfect. The BLT looked awesome. The fries were delicious. We will definitely be back.
other I have been a "regular" customer at this salon ever since it opened.  At first it was great!  Clean, relaxing, and welcoming.   After a few months without a manicure or pedicure I decide to treat myself to a manicure this past week.  I went in and a lady did a beautiful job on my gel manicure.  She paid attention to detail and didn't rush through the whole process.  I didn't have time to get a pedicure so I decided to come back the next day.  I only wish that I had her do my pedicure yesterday ... The guy who did my pedicure had some sort of infection on his thumb.  I didn't notice it at first because he was using gloves but when it was time for the foot massage he took his gloves off, revealing it.  Tracy was doing someone else's nails right in front of me and clearly saw that he had some sort of sore or fungus on his nail.  It was completely black and it looked like something was growing out of it.    I was shocked that she didn't tell him to at least put his gloves back on.  The "massage" that he gave me was hardly any massage at all.  He did the same motion over and over while concentrating on the tv.  Definitely not worth the $25.   The worst part is that he gave me an ingrown toe nail.  The whole right side of my nail is swollen and I just hope that I don't get an infection.  This was by far the worst pedicure that I have ever received. Even though I had a great gel manicure here, my last experience was so horrible that I will not be back.
other Angelina's Pho and grill was very good! excellent appetisers; which were very fresh and brought to us in a very timely manor. The service was very good! restaurant was very clean, as was bathroom!  the pho was good, not the best best in the valley but very good! the broth was a little bit too salty for me. we will defintely go to this pho restaurant again!
3 I don't know why I waited so long to try this place when it is literally right around the corner from my house.  I think its because I went to the one in Ahwatukee a long time ago and didn't care for the food.  But I don't think they have the same owners since the websites are totally different.  But anyway, on to the review.We ordered takeout and I was very impressed with how nicely it was all packaged and how quickly it was ready.  Also, the woman on the phone was very friendly, easy to understand in spite of an accent, and patient in explaining the menu items that I was unfamiliar with. All the appetizers sounded so good, we decided to get a bunch so the hubby and I could just pick at them since he was sick and didn't have much of an appetite.  However, the portions were bigger than expected so we ended up with quite a lot of food.  Lettuce wraps were very tasty, I loved the dressing on them.  Eggrolls were good but a little too much "wrapper" and not enough filling IMO.  Sweet potato chips were not what I was expecting, they were the white sweet potatoes that really don't have much taste to them and they were deep fried with I believe a panko breading on them.  A little bland but the sweet/hot dipping sauce they came with was fantastic.  I loved it so much I would order this again just for the sauce.  Also got some chicken soup for the sick hubby which I didn't try but he said was quite good. I threw in some pad thai noodles since that basic dish is always my test when evaluating a new Thai restaurant.  I asked for a four (out of five) on the spiciness scale and that was perfect for me.  I was very pleased at the heat level and overall flavor of the dish.  So many places hold back on the chiles if you are American, even if I insist I want it hot, and I have never understood why. The only thing missing was a squeeze of lime and garnish of fresh cilantro that I like on my pad thai.  Presumably you could get that upon request if you were dining in, it was no big deal to me since I had some at home.I still prefer Yupha's as the best Thai in the area.  But I will definitely be back here for takeout because of the friendly, speedy service and convenient location.  I noticed some wine bottles in the back when I was picking up my food so that may entice me to dine-in at some point as well.
other Sunridge Canyon has been one of my very favorite courses since I first played it 6+ years ago. I have to admit I did work here for a two-year span several years ago, but it was one of my favorites before, during, and since then.It's not as hyped as Grayhawk, Troon, and some other courses but it's just as great of a layout, if not better than some of the more popular high-end courses in the valley (definitely better than the overrated Grayhawk). The course has the rare distinction of being very playable yet very challenging at the same time. You'll be toast if you don't hit it fairly straight on most holes, but you won't be punished for hitting it where you intended like some of the blind-shot-heavy courses (i.e. We-Ko-Pa) here in the valley. I've shot in the 70s one day and in the 90s the next out there.Besides the superb and scenic layout, I also like the simplicity of the overall complex. It's not at a big resort, there aren't multiple courses, and there is no grand clubhouse (not that all those things are always bad). It's just the 18 holes, pro shop, and a restaurant that serves up some pretty solid food. The staff is friendly and helpful, too. It's like a neighborhood course albeit a high-end one. They have some great summer rates for locals this summer: Any day, any time for only $35. I recommend all valley golfers to enjoy that rate while it lasts. I played yesterday and the course was in good shape tee-to-green, and outstanding shape on the greens. It's been awhile since I've seen greens roll this well on a $3other course here in town.One last, but important, note: It gets WINDY out here. As in, it gets windy every day. The course plays through a canyon and the winds are swirling all the time. An early morning tee time is best since it gives you your best chance to take on the uphill back-nine without the wind gusting in your face.
other Very much my kind of a place, it reminded me of the places in Europe/Berlin that I loved so much. Its like a house setting & on the days that we went they had a live band playing great fusion stuff in the back rooms. Their Beer collection is amazing of course, one of the few places in Phoenix with such a huge beer collection.
other One of these days I will learn NOT to take out of town guests to places I haven't tried first.  I was pretty excited for one of my favorite people to come and visit.  Her only request?  Sushi!  While I have my list of absolute AZ favorites (Tokyo Lobby, Toyama, Sakana, Hiro, Dozo) foolishly I decided we should try somewhere new.  Having read many good things about Hana, the choice was made.Walking into the BYOB place with our Kirin Ichiban in hand, we were ready for a great evening.  Too bad that isn't what we experienced.  After being ignored for a few minutes by everyone who passed by and even the person behind the counter, I found someone to tell that there were two of us and we would like to sit at the sushi bar.  Although there were spots open, we were left standing there for quite a while.  Do you want to stand around holding a 6-pack and not even be offered a bottle opener?  Me neither.  Once we were finally seated, we weren't told about any specials, offered water or even glasses for our beer.  Deciding to make the best of it, we ordered:Yellowtail sashimi (good, the best item we had)Spicy scallop nigiri (good)Albacore sashimi (dry, not sliced through, leaving us top pick off overcooked bits and pieces)Freshwater eel nigiri (dry and crumbly rice, falling apart at the touch)Scallop dynamite ($15+ for 'krab'?  Really?)The female sushi chef was nice but our waitress was nonexistent.  Other tables and customers at the sushi bar seemed to be getting decent service (water, getting their beer/wine/whatever from the refrigerator) but we were left without water refills (once we finally got any at all) and don't even think about getting another of those BYOB beers we brought.  It even took a while to get the unused bottles back when we were trying to leave. Lackluster food and nonexistent service at a premium price.  No thanks.
other I told myself not to buy clothes at Macy's since I did not have that much room in my carry-on luggage. Darn you Macy's!! Why did you have a bazillion racks of clothes that was on sale!!! NooOOo.. I could not resist the temptation and bought other shirts for $60. I wanted to buy more too!! I have a love-hate relationship with this Macy's.
other this place is no where close to anything you can get in la or oc. It taste liked it came out of the bag. plain and simple
other Cheesy, beefy, greasy GREATNESS.   The burgers are made as you watch..  Sit at the bar and watch the grill cook (who also is the server, bartender, and cashier)  grab a nice fat ball of ground and pound it out on the grill to make your one of a kind patty.  NEXT comes the wine onto the grill and the patty... which gives the place it's name.  Finish it off with a fat layers of veggis.Pair this with some jalapeno bottle caps and a pint of draft, and your in BUSINESS!!!Don't mind the dingy early 70s decor....it is character.The only negative...you will be jogging for weeks to drop those calories...a very guilty pleasure.
3 Great food and awesome service! Even better that the Chef came out and personally checked on our experience. I will be back for more delicious BBQ
other Impossibly good Italian deli in the middle of the desert. Huge sandwiches on the most incredible bread you've ever had outside of NY. As someone who ate here 3 times in a 2other hr period, I feel especially compelled to tell you about their cheesesteak. HO-LY-SHIT. Easily the most decadent, flavorful cheesesteak I've had in a VERY long time - and I live 1other minutes outside of Philly. Im still in disbelief that they could pull something like that off. Ask for yours on the soft roll.I should also mention the sausage,  peppers & onion sandwich, which was really good. I suspect they make their own sausage, which elevates them to superstar status in my book. The chicken parm sandwich and dinner are both equally good, and the meatball sandwich deserves honorable mention as well.I dont do cold subs, but the ones I saw coming out of the kitchen looked huge and tasty. Perhaps I will try their pizza next time I'm in town.
other Had to bring my wife's necklace here to be repaired. Service was great, the pretty looking girls were very helpful. In all, we had a very good experience. Looks like we will be coming back soon. Wife had her eyes on something?
other Meh.  Service was friendly, and the atmosphere is bright and festive, but it's pretty Americanized Mexican food.  I had a California burro ($9.49), which was a large size, and tasted OK, but for about 1/3 of the price and for about the same size, I can get a better tasting burro with the same type of ingredients at Los Favoritos.  I've also had dishes with their Baja sauce, which tends to be too heavy tasting for me.
3 In the office, Fiesta Burrito is aptly known as "across the street."  Kind of like, "How about across the street?"  "Yeah, I could do across the street, today."  If I ever said, "How about Fiesta Burrito?"  I would get, "Where's that?"  Then I would have to say, "You know, across the street."  And the response would be, "Well, why didn't you say so in the first place."The primary reason we eat at "across the street" is because it is convenient - it's across the street.  And in the immortal words of my most quotable co-worker, "It is fast, cheap, and good -- no questions asked."  The part about it being good is debatable.  I could do with a little less greasy.  Fast, no question.  And despite that fact that "across the street" charges 60 cents for spicy carrots now, the prices are low.  I like the chorizo plate with a side of sour cream, although I might start branching out as we eat at "across the street" way too much, and I'm getting tired of always having the same thing.At just above a dive, I would call it a hole in the wall, but really, it is just a generic Mexican joint that hides in plain sight.  Even the name is rather plain as no one can seem to remember it.  There is a smallish, generic inside dining area, which is accompanied by a small, generic patio for outside dining.  Some high school students seem to come by for lunch leave.  The staff is polite.  Until they move or I no longer work across the street, I'll be a regular.
other Pita Jungle is a staple favorite of mine and my boyfriend's. Healthy, hearty and great service. It's too bad that a lot of their prices have gone up (as have other restaurants) but I'll still patronize this place. Read as: some things went up in price almost two dollars, but you can still have a meal and a drink for around $10, more or less, depending on what you order. I definitely like this place over the new one across MCC on Southern - there's something about being by the lake that makes it special. Even if there are stinky ducks there from time to time. ;)Ooh - and the gambas con ajos is my favorite appetizer! :)
other Been twice. Authentic, high quality & great price for what you get. Salsa de Chile de Arbol was the best!! Loved the decor. Orchata tasted fresh, which is a rarity in most Mexican Restaurants.
other MEOW! This place is great - super clean, loaded with an amazing assortment of natural foods for both pooches and kitties, and two fridges jammed full with raw diet selections!  My four-footed kids were in heaven going through the bags!Not wanting to offend anyone in my bunch (it's impossible to travel anywhere with three dogs and two cats, while simultaneously maintaining any level of decorum), I went solo this weekend to support the latest AzRESCUE effort being sponsored by the store. In addition to them sending me home with a complimentary Yoghund for each of the kids, I got some great insight to private training that my youngest is in desperate need of if he ever hopes to be socially acceptable, and some great toys for the felines. The staff was unbelievably nice, they have some truly unique items, and the prices range from "wow that's pretty cheap" to OMG do I dare?!!!This is a great option to the chains and big box stores, so grab your leash, wag that tail, and pad your way on down to the Noble Beast!!!
other I have been to many Thai restaurants in the Valley and this is the one that I aways go back to. Their roasted duck is consistently good. Get the Ped gang daeng (801).
other Easily the worst "burrito" I have ever had.It amazes my that anyone would choose to eat at this chain. I bet the rations they serve from the back of UN trucks to refugees is better.
3 I want to like Turf, but the food is just okay.  I've only been here twice, but it was not mind-blowing.I'm not fond of the shepherd's pie here.  It is the most bland version I have had... even in this town.  The wings, however, are pretty good.  I've eaten wings here with a couple Harps and have had a decent time.Surprisingly good is their seared ahi tuna.  It is pretty weird to think an Irish pub would do this well, but they do.  A friend ordered it and after shaking my head and saying there's no way it could be good, I tried a bite and I had to eat crow.  Turf is typically a stop on the pub crawl, so I will definitely be back again for boozing.
other I have to tell you....I had their Jerk Chicken Plate the other night, and it was yuuuuummmmmyyy! You gotta try it!
other How can something so simple taste sooo good? I wish there were one more on the west side. I hate going to the fair to get my fix of fry bread. There needs to be one of these on every  corner of the compass in Phoenix! As Rachel Ray would say, "Yummy!"
other Service is always great, and the waiters are plesant and nice to have serve you.  This is one of my favorite breweries to come too.  They have a good selection of beer that is made in house, and you can also get a growler of any type to take home (or home made root beer, which is also amazing)  I have never had anything less than a great meal in the around 60 times I have ate here.
other I really like this place alot. their pizza's are really different but really good! I wish i could say i had a favorite but ive liked every pizza ive gotten except the portabello mushrooms cause i dont like mushrooms but other than that they have an amazing beer selection! Major thumbs up!!
other So i'm not here to buy spices or shop for sheesha, i'm here for food. Lots and lots of food. Luckily for me, Haji-Baba is known for tons of food at decent prices so I have a promising evening of stuffing my face without breaking my wallet. God, I sound like a really cheap buffet commercial.But really, to be truthfully, super blunt, honest-to-go-honest truth, Haji-Baba's food is not the best in the world but it is 1) fresh, 2) good quality, 3) tasty and 4) cheap. I am sure you can find better Mediterranean food around town, but this place is really good on your wallet and fits my needs just right. And hey, 21other reviews can't be lying. THE PEOPLE LIKE IT. They like it a lot.I ordered the gyro deluxe (gyro with raw onions and feta cheese), a side order of hummus, Babaganoush (eggplant dip), tried my friends lamb tongue and a pistachio  baklava. If you are feeling adventurous and want to try the lamb tongue, lemme tell you: don't. Really, don't. There is nothing tasty about lamb tongue. It tastes slightly like roast beef but the texture resembles congealed liver patee and the big chunks are really scary. The only positive about eating tongue? Infinite pun jokes about talking about it forever. Get it?The gyro meat was pretty standard in the Gyro deluxe sandwich, the best thing about it was the creamy fresh salty feta cheese. Its the freshest i've ever had and they really DO slap it on that sandwich, like a boss. The babaganoush was also very very tasty with the pickle and the black olive- however- i would have liked bigger pieces of roasted eggplant than a hummus-like texture. The hummus was just A-OK, it needed more of a PUNCH of flavor. Last but not least, the baklava is my favorite dessert in all the land.. so obviously I enjoyed it. Heavy on the honey and not very crispy on the nuts, but pretty decent nonetheless.In conclusion, only use the tongue in your mouth and not the one on the menu, get as much feta cheese as your body can process and buy a desert to-go. BAM, lunch is served.
other Some buddies and I went to Scottsdale for a golfing boondoggle last week and a couple of guys in the know directed us to The Mission.DANG!We let our server, Jonathan, drive the car so to speak.  He quizzed us on our likes and dislikes and brought us our orders (we didn't specifically order).  We had 7 people in our group and every plate was spot on.  We started with the chicken (thigh) tostadas and the crispy cola pork belly tostadas.  They were great; particularly the pork belly ones.  MAN were those good.  My dinner was the Chorizo Porchetta which brought a big hunk of slow cooked pork that shredded beautifully.  Along side this hunka hunka porky love was a salt block carrying 10 small corn tortillas to build little tacos from.  Some tasty accompaniments: sauce, onion, & cilantro, finished the presentation.  It was a fantastic dish.  The other 6 dishes were just as great.  To note: the honey chipotle grits that my buddy got were super tasty.  Especially when you dumped some of their ghost chili sauce (forget what it was called).  Desert was the Pumpkin bread pudding (YUM!) and fried bananas.  All in all, a fantastic place.  Really good.
other You don't come for the run-of-the-mill pizza. Nor do you show up for the cheap pitchers of beer. No, you make it here for the show. A massive organ fills the entire building, incorporating dozens of intruments, and the virtuosos playing it take center stage. Sit back and watch then perform your favorite songs, from Star Wars to The Little Mermaid. Don't let the average food dissuade you from a one-of-a-kind experience.
other I will begin by saying that I've been wanting to try this place for months now, simply because they have a salad that bears my name. Which reminds me of my high school days, when the internet was new and I spent an afternoon with a friend visiting websites that also had our name. Most ended up being adult sites, but tonia.com* was an Asian company that had my name written in a fantastic logo. I wonder what it means. Anywho, not only does the salad live up to its given name, but Moto is now on my backup sushi rotation. Reasonably priced and of good quality, I was extremely full by the time I ate only half of my dinner. The Tonia salad I actually had for lunch a day later, and was very filling and delicious. I can only imagine what it would've been like eating it the same night. Had it not been as great, I would've never came back and written to the owners, demanding the salad change to a lesser awesome name, maybe one more common or boring.My to go order was ready exactly when they said it would and I was in and out the door in minutes. I'll be back.*I have no idea if this is still the same site anymore. I am not responsible for where the link leads.. now.. or in the future
other came here one night alone.  the hostess sat me down and kept staring at me as if there was a problem eating alone! i found that a little rude.my waiter, however, was nice.  I only got the french onion soup and chocolate souffle for dessert since i heard good things about their soup.  it came out in this cute little cauldron, piping hot, cheese all gooey, and several crispy chucks of cheeses were tucked near the edges.  it was good french onion soup, although i have not tasted enough different french onion soup to judge it as one of the best.  the chocolate souffle took a while to make but it was quite delicious.  my server brought it out and poured this warm choc sauce infused with some sort of liquor.  the etoh didnt evaporate so there was still a strong taste to me, which i dont prefer.  the souffle itself was soft and fluffy which was good.
other I hate food shopping.  Okay that is probably an understatement.  When I go to a big market I am so overwhelmed and usually end up with a million things I don't need, while forgetting the things I do need.  Fresh & Easy is small, but it has most things I need.  I like that they have meats and chicken that already have seasoning on it and are ready to cook.  This makes shopping extremely easy.  I also really like their brand of food, especially the pasta.  I think it's some of the best tasting store bought pasta I have had.  Don't go here if you need to buy kitchen supplies like cake pans or cookie sheets.  They simply have food, drinks, wine and beer here.
other The food here was really good. I ordered the sesamie chicken and the sauce was very good. The service was marginal at best but it didn't annoy me. I'd go back
other As much of a sweet tooth that i have (dark decadent chocolate is my weakness)..Toffee was never my thing ,never on my mind ..And then i sampled Goodytwo's toffee ..wowzer !Sweet and salty toffee is regoddamndiculously good ..seriously good !They have a toffee topped popcorn ..these gals are killing me ..oh ,oh the twozels sinfully delish magical pretzel mix with kettle corn ,nuts and chocolate .Listen ,you can't put a price on happiness ,ha ha Everyone i love is getting their stockings stuffed with a box of salty-sweet love from Goodytwo's.Nothing more delicious or sexy ,ya sexy then a salty sweet combo ..it is a heavenly pairing ..Goodytwo's has perfected this,worth every penny !Rock on ladies !
other I've only been to the bar here. They make amazing mojitos with an array of different fruits. I told the bartender to surprise me when I ordered my drink, and it was amazing. She put a mixture of fruit along with the mint and it was perfectly mixed. I also had their spicy shrimp appetizer which I didn't really care for. So many other places make a similar dish, but much better. They also serve really good rolls with butter that come out nice and warm. The texture of the rolls are a little unexpected. I think they use tapioca flour as their base. I will definitely be back to enjoy their main dining cuisine.
other From the moment you enter this place you get the feeling that you are entering some swanky underground restaurant, the lighting is dark and the decor is mysterious!!  I am in love with the fashionable staff who come to work wearing what they want as well as the chef in the back with the 1other inch mohawk. The drink menu is stocked with exciting choices such as "In Between the Sheets" and the "Dirty School Girl"! Not your average bar! The BEST thing on the menu in my opinion is the House Made Fettuccine. Honestly the best homemade meat sauce ever and I am hard to please considering I was raised on Bolognese sauce! A great place to take a date whether it be your first or 100th this place will never disappoint.
3 i love mac n' cheese & i love the dark.  these other facts make me like this place. the service was good. the prices were reasonable. they had a decent selection of craft beer & local wine. the dark colors and candles were comforting.  (however this atmosphere makes the headlights from the cars parking up against the windows somewhat more obtrusive)a solid 3 stars for me.. i wasn't blown away, but i wasn't disappointed....p.s. i think maybe i'll miss lisa g's..?!
other I didn't really "get it".I was expecting more Island style food, or more adventurous treats.*  Bar was great.*  Tuna Poke thing was fantastic.*  Cajun burger was terrific, but the bun was too dense and troublesome.*  Chicken CocoaJoe was a bust.  Chicken a little dry and under-seasoned, rice and beans were bland (needs a giant ham-hock and about 3 more days).  The Plaintain was overflavored, but underseasoned (they don't neem much more than salt and time).Awesome location.Menu will expand I am sure.Repaint the bathroom please.
other BYOB and you can get a flaming boat of sushi?! #winningThis is an awesome neighborhood place with reasonable prices and delicious menu options. Plus, it's BYOB - a rarity it seems.I attended with a party of four and we spent about $110 and were stuffed on tons of food. The noodle dishes and sushi were great and our server was a lot of fun.
other I've been to this place three times and have enjoyed it every time.  The service has been good.  No complaints.We really like the thin crust pizza's.  And the salads have been big and tasty.  Spliting one small pizza and a salad with my wife if plenty for us.We've also had the lunch special of a large slice of pizza and a salad.  Just the right amount of food and tasty.My wife and I think the prices seem fair for the good quality of the food.This is now our first choice for Pizza, since we aren't going to drive all the way downtown and wait two hours at Chris Biancos every time we want pizza.
other Delicious. With me, i'm all about frosting.  And Sprinkles delivers! Big, thick layer of frosting on every cupcake. I recently had the Mocha, dark choc cupcake with mocha frosting. Wow... It was so rich i had to take a break of about other min before i could finish it. I'm a big fan of the vanilla and banana. You just can't go wrong with cream cheese frosting, right?  OH!  And the best thing of all... You can get a "shot" of frosting!  Yep... A 1oz dixie cup piled high with a flavor of your choice for 75cents.  I usually eat my frosting shot in the store while waiting for my cupcake order.   ;-)  It's pricey, but its not an everyday thing... Its a treat and a good one!
other Went there for two games back to back days. The first was a night game and they had the roof open. The temp. inside was great and made for a real enjoyable evening. During the game was able to watch a 747 fly overhead, very surreal. During the day game they had the roof closed to keep the AZ sun and heat out. I personally thought it was a little warm inside even though they announced it was about 7other degrees, not sure if that was accurate or not. I know AZ spend loads of money on the AC, but I wasn't impressed.Overall the place is nice and all the amenities are very close by. I had sections 11other and 109 and both offered great views of the field and visitors bullpen. The service at the concession stands is great and the lines move by pretty quickly. Still not the #other stadium in the MLB.
other to make a long story short --- we had a coupon for this place.  We know its an ASU hang out but the coupon was for spend 50.00 get 25.00 off.  Ok service was not good --- when we got the bill the pizza and wings were charged separate -- not right -- it was a together order per the menu.  We had a pitcher of beer and a single beer plus food -- bill was almost 70.00 -- we gave the waitress the coupon -- she had to change the bill for the pizza and wings --- then she came back and stated the coupon had a 18% gratuity and service charge of 13.59.  Based on what ???  that actually ate up the coupon and we ended up paying full price anyway.  Never again --- and the food was fair --- not a good place to return to -- ASU take it away -- its all yours -----
other This is a GREAT place to eat! One of my favorite lunch stops as you can see if you follow my facebook photos "Lunch With Stew". My favorite thing there is the Buffalo Chicken Pizza. mmmmm, mmm. Kevin O'Donnell is from the Texas Hold'em family of final tables and occasionally will play the tour. Super great guy and he also has a super great restaurant and sports bar.
3 Since I work @ a casino, I'm always checking out the others...Plus, I like to gamble!! This place is nice, but seemed to be lacking personality. It's new, so it's very clean, w/all new machines. The few employees I dealt with, seemed extremely bored, and a drink girl was nowhere to be found. Because this place is new, and @ the edge of the Phx. area, they don't have to try very hard, and I think it shows.
3 Michael C is right. This place is very charming. I love the inside decor, with brick walls. I love the "No Sniveling" sign hanging behind the bar.It's a small place, but that's part of the appeal. There's a small upstairs patio, with a fireplace (wasn't on when I went) that could be a great spot to hang. It's not much of a view, but there's something cool about being at a higher elevation. Finding J. Chew was a little bit of a challenge. We ended up stopping at AZ88 to ask for directions. LOL! When we arrived, my friend and I sashayed up to the bar. Immediately we had a drink menu in front of us. I was more intrigued by the huge crystal ball-esque 20 Questions game. I wanted to play!When I asked about beer, the 'tender motioned to the shelf above his head. Ahh... Not a great selection, but it'll do. I went with the Honey Brown. $4.50. Great price. Okay beer. I'll order something else next time, if I can make up my mind. Stella? Fat Tire? Hmm... The whole reason for venturing to J. Chew was for a celebration. My friend was getting married, and this was her final Saturday night as a "single." So, the group of women sat outside on the small patio area. It was a cold, chilly May evening and they had the fireplace going. They also had a couple heat lamps working, but most of them were out of propane. Bummer. We Phoenix Dwellers were shivering our coconuts off, if you know what I mean. (Praise Allah for fingerless gloves, which were a big hit that night.) But, the bartender did try and keep them going, so we appreciated his efforts!Overall, I like J Chew. Yet I can't rate it higher than 3.other for a few reasons. Yes, one is the beer selection. While it's small, it's also doable. Yet, their mixed martini list looked disgusting. Then again, I don't do martinis. Nor do I throw down $1other on a mixed drink. But the real annoyance came from other patrons. From one guy in a hockey jersey throwing himself against the glass door (even hitting his head on the glass, when prompted) to a crazy D'Backs fan yelling in the face of a calm Braves supporter, those couple of guys just totally zapped the cool, calm and collected from J. Chew & Co. There's something defeating and sad about seeing another man yell "Lock it up!" at another man, during what could be a calm, mature discussion about two sports teams they individually love and follow. There's something even sadder about watching an aging man with a cigar hit on a married woman. He just wouldn't leave our group alone. Oh well...Maybe they won't be there when I go back... because I think if they are, I'm gonna have to say something. How obnoxious. If you're in Old Town and looking for a chill spot to hang, this is your place. Plus, I liked the music they had on rotation... From Modest Mouse and Postal Service to 90's grunge and alternative rock, I was diggin' the tunes, along with the laid back atmosphere, the great service and the knowledge that there was a chill place in Snottsdale to hang. Who knew?! I just don't think there's a strong enough draw to hang at this place all night. This is more of your "before dinner" or "before another bar" type of estabilshment. Only problem is there's not many other cool places in the area I'd be interested in going, especially on a Saturday night when Snottsdale is out in full force.
other ...NOW WE'RE TALKIN'! Killer Mexican Food! The chips 'n salsa kicks ass! You get a red, blue & regular tortilla chips with reg, spicy salsa & bean dip! Hellava start! A kick-butt margarita! Had Chicken Fajitas!...THE BEST! Cannot wait to return! Great ambiance.
other Delicious. Can't be the pricing on the lunch menu at a sit down restaurant. Great interior decor that doesn't scream Chinese restaurant. So far I've had the House Special Chicken and Sweet and Sour Chicken. Both were great.
other Free samples? One dollar churros? Cheap buys? Why not.
other R.T. O'Sullivan's really hit the spot! The service and the atmosphere were outstanding. We were put into the back room which was perfect for our large group of 4other plus. The server kept track of everything even as people moved around and socialized. The food was wonderful. We will be going back!
other I'd have to say that among the restuarants in the Tom Jetland suite (Fez, Ticoz, Switch), Ticoz is my favorite because of its dimly-lit lounge-like quality, which provides it a cozier feel than the other two.  Add to that, the hypnotic Mojito creations and Ticoz is one of those places I could spend an entire weekend late afternoon at, as long as someone else drives, of course.The tamales are fantastic and are more similar to corn pudding than to traditional hand rolled tamales.  If you get them with veggies, you'll find that the veggies are a little oddly cut for the dish, so I recommend some other topping.  The beef is fantastic (especially in the tacos).All in all, this is one of my current favorites.
other The staff here made the place awesome. They were friendly, on top of things (including when I lost my cell phone), and didn't really blink an eye at the crazy antics of the adult webmasters.I loved how close they are to food, bars, and even adult romance store on Mill -- I could just walk through the court yard and hit Rula Bula and RA.However, I had two things I didn't like as much. A) there wasn't enough non-outdoor, non-sunny space to hang out in. Yes, it's Phoenix and people come here to get tan...but I live here, and burn ridiculously easily. Yet everything was in the sun, because there was no large, sun-free area.  Also, b) while the lobby, courtyard and seminar rooms were nice, the hallways and actual hotel rooms seemed a bit outdated. Also, trying to find the pool with no signs? Not so much fun.All in all, a nice hotel and the perfect place to hold a pervert conference. I'm sure I'll be back at some point!
other I'm still feelin the love. A most wonderful combination found I today of simple delightful food, a laid back atmosphere, warm staff, dog-friendly accommodations, a vegan-friendly menu and... oh yeah... all day Monday Happy Hour.  Thank you TMI for the immediate bowl of water set down for my hound, the speedy $other glass of red, and a yummy manageably-sized veg sandwich. I couldn't have asked for a better ending to this much dreaded Monday. It was lovely winding down and enjoying the sunset while other suckers waited in traffic.I second Sarah G's enthusiasm for Sophie's salad sans mozzarella. Mmmm mmmm arthichoke. My next mission is the Cash Money sammie with house made cashew butter (wha?!) Cabernet jelly AND bananas. It's like Elvis met Sophia Lauren and decided to class it up. Soon will I be back to attempt such an adventure. Very soon.
other I had dinner at the True Food in Scottsdale on a Thursday a couple of weeks ago.  There is really nothing not to like here.  the restaurant itself is great looking and will be wonderful when the weather warms up as all the walls are glass doors.  I thought alcohol was well priced or least the wine was as you get glasses starting at $6.  we shared the lettuce cups as an appetizer and they were quite tasty although messy to eat as are all the dishes that use lettuce as a tortilla.  I had the puttanesca with a twist--no anchovies--instead with ahi tuna--it was quite tasty and was a right sized portion.  My sister in law had a tofu curry--that also was quite flavorful--even though I am not a fan of curry and can take or leave tofu.  head the chocolate cake for dessert which was just right.  I will definitely go back-all in all a pleasant evening.
other Everything about Coronado Cafe is charming and scrumptious.  It's my go-to place when I want to have a nice, but not fussy, lunch with a friend.  The menu has a lot of variety but not so much that it's overwhelming.  I've never been disappointed by the food.  The raspberry iced tea is delicious too! I like that they don't have any fried food, though my male friends don't so much appreciate that as they prefer fries with their burgers.  Conversations can be challenging when dining inside-- the acoustics in an old house aren't the best to begin with, and then you cram it full of people and it gets a little noisy.  If you can't tune it out, the patio is a really lovely alternative. All in all, you really can't go wrong here!
other What can I say except that Jodi is incredible. I had purchased an online deal because I've always wanted to do something like this and thought it to be a great gift for my other half. I sent her a message and she quickly responded. Almost everything I needed to know for the shoot was emailed to me. You have the opportunity to do your own hair and makeup or have someone she works with do it at a reasonable rate. I highly recommend that you get it done by her ladies. That day I saw Erica. She was really fun and got me into the mood (the glass of wine helped too :-) ) and she did an incredible job with the makeup and hair. For those who feel a little nervous I do recommend bringing some wine along with you. It really loosens you up a bit and allows you to be more comfortable. It was perfect since my first photos were the nude shots. Note: wear loose fitting clothing, nothing elastic and be sure that you do not have a sunburn on your body. Let your hair air dry and it is OK to put on your own serums and moisturizers prior to the shoot. Make sure nothing with sunscreen gets on your face and while it's not necessary, I made sure to use a primer. I thought it really helped out with how my makeup set. Be prepared to pose in positions that may be a bit awkward and also note that you will likely be sore the next day from the different twisting that you have to do. Jodi really knows how to make you feel comfortable and at ease. I don't make a habit of being in the buff in front of complete strangers and for me to drop my robe without feeling shy was a big deal for me. It helped that I had my own music mix on my iPod throughout the entire shoot as well. The overall whole experience was incredible. I felt sexy and confident. I went back with my honey to look at the photos. He really really liked them and had a hard time choosing which he wanted to go into the album. I can't wait to see everything finished. I can't wait to do it again :) Thank you Jodi for making it such a memorable experience. I highly recommend her and her ladies!!!
other Just came from there as part of my trip down the Apache Trail. My 9year old daughter loved it so much she insisted on stopping in again on the way back. The town is really cute with tons of photo ops. We picked up a few fun souveniers and some prickly pear fudge. We did this in 100 degree temps and still enjoyed it. For those curmudgeons moaning about this being a tourist trap, RELAX....the kids love it. This 40 something mom loved it. It's free to just walk around.  But definitely do the Mystery Shack. Weird and fun. I actually got dizzy in it.
other I don't often review places on Yelp because of the time commitment and because usually I am just looking for a good bite to eat. This time, though I feel I should if not to balance the ridiculous number of other and other stars bouncing around for this place.The food was decent, and the atmosphere OK but seriously, how can this place cost as much as it does ($60+ for two people eating light)?? And how are people fawning all over it? I don't like to complain about a good meal, and indeed this meal was good but I can't seem to justify the cost as compared to most any other place I have tried in Phoenix that would be considered in St. Francis' class. I ordered a Hearts of Romaine Salad and a bowl of cauliflower soup. I shared a plate of the baked goat cheese with my guest. Not one of these dishes would have tasted much different had I made them myself from ingredients at the Public Market. Indeed, I have had cauliflower soup at the market that tasted just as good for a fraction of the price.The service was good, I will say, and for that I would offer a higher rating. But the general ambiance of pretension was more than I could justify, again for a meal I feel like I have had 100 times before. In the end I guess I would say if they would knock about $10 off of each plate, and cut some of the pretentious attitude, I would probably be offering a much  better review. I am not planning a return anytime soon.
other The "Protein Pancakes" are always a treat, but the "California Eggs Benedict" was just awful today.  The biggest disappointment were the hash browns though.  They tasted like shredded cardboard.  I am tired of going to a restaurant 20 to 30 times and getting such inconsistent results.Shame on you US Egg!
3 Taberna and Ninfa's are owned by the same restaurant group out of Houston.  Is it a coincidence that the FTR for Taberna is by someone who has only reviewed both of these spots and gave each five stars?  I think not.Here's my objective review:Taberna is in the Scottsdale Seville where Roy's used to be.  They have a large outside patio that will be great when the weather is nice.I ate lunch at the bar and enjoyed chatting with the friendly bartender.  The menu is upscale Mexican food.  I liked the basket of chips they brought out to start.  It came mixed with chips and plantains and two nice salsas.I also ordered the al carbon steak enchiladas.  They were good and spicy served with what I believe was a mole sauce.Overall the quality of the food was good but a little expensive.  I would come back, but it's not at the top of my list.
other Since moving to Arizona I have selected Fry's as my new grocer and am very happy with my choice! I immediately signed up for their VIP card and love seeing the many savings listed on the receipt after every trip.I am especially happy that I have moved closer to this Frys as it is open 2other hours and even when shopping in the wee hours of the morning can expect to see some nocturnal ASU students.Any interactions I have had with the staff have been pleasant and enjoyable.
other NOTE: Ignore the reviews above. It looks as if there is some deliberate attempt by the Udupai owners to pose as members and bash this place. Yes, this owner used to own Udupai Cafe and Udupai Cafe is another dosa house that competes with this eatery.  If you read my other reviews, you know that I'm critical and  my attention to detail is there so I'm not one of these people who likes every place he eats at.PositivesI'm Indian and I can assure you this place is good. I have never been to Udupai Cafe but based on its failing health inspections, I would be scared to eat there. Woodlands is a nice CLEAN eatery in a nice part of Chandler.  It's not a restaurant.  It's basically a Dosa shop. They  specialize in Dosa and offer several types. They also have excellent Indian Chinese dishes.   The food is consistently good and I have eaten there on several occassions.  This is a lunch/light dinner place.  Don't think of this place like a restaurant.  There are several types of Dosa and that's what this place specializes in.  The restaurant is also modern and not is some ghetto strip mall so don't worry about failing health codes here...at least not for a while.NegativesTheir non-South Indian dishes are not so good. For non-Indians, they should be informed that this is a Dosa house so order dosa and other south Indian dishes.  Don't order your typical Indian restaurant favorites like palak paneer (it wasn't good here).   The owner also says every dish is excellent which isn't true; he is kind of a businessman so he doesn't really care about telling you which dishes stand out.  Stick to the Dosa and the Vegetable Manchurian.  Their mango shake wasn't very good. Their chiku shake is great.
other These guys have some yummy donuts and the prices are great.  Their donuts seems to be more authentic... they feel more hand made than machine made.   I'll be back.
other Love this place! I wasn't sure about it the first time, seeing that is in a strip mall, but like the saying goes don't judge a book by it's cover. I order the CHICKEN W/ GREEN every time and have not been disappointed. EGG ROLLS are wrapped in thin egg roll paper, spicy, & delicious. MANGO CHICKEN & CLAY POT DISHES are also excellent.Independent & yummy.
other note: the other stars i'm giving this place is for their happy hour menu, not the regular menu. if you order off the regular menu no amount of advice can help you.M&S has to have one of the best happy hours in the world, aside from Spearmint Rhino. $3 drafts and a rotating $other bar food menu, such as 1/other lb. burger with fries, hot wings, fish tacos, beef taquitos, etc. don't order the fish chilli though, it tastes like Aother sauce. they got a lot of winners on tap, like kiltlifter, guinness, bass, fat tire, pyramid hefe, etc.happy hour is from 3p-6p and then again from 9p-11p, which is pure genius. make sure you get your parking ticket balidated, because the Eritrean girl in the parking garage will make you go back in the restaurant and get that joint stamped if you forget. BUZZKILL.
other I love sakana. They have the best lunch time happy hour! Its always delicious and seriously reasonably priced. :)
other Finally a teriyaki bowl place that does it right.  Nothing against Samuri Sam's, but Yogis is a bit better in my opinion.  Yogis'  menu is strait forward and clearly lists the options available.  The place is clean and the staff is fast and friendly.  The food is also very reasonably priced.  I was very impressed with their different bowl/plate/salad options.  You are able to order some teriyaki veggies, chicken and/or beef pretty much however you want it.  Extra meat, over lettuce, over veggies, brown rice, white rice, etc.  Anyway, when I visit a place like this my desires are simple.  I want a decent portion of not-overly-sauced white meat chicken over a bunch of veggies.  That's it.  Yogis delivers this and then some.
other Walking in to Five Guys, I was rather excited, and was looking forward to my experience. I have never been to a Five Guys before, so this was something new. My first reaction upon opening the doors was the music was blaring. Too loud, at least. The music was classic rock, which I don't mind. After walking up and reviewing the easily understood menu and waiting in line for a few minutes, someone took our order. The order taker seemed like she was having a long day, not seeming very interested in the customer. While taking the order, one could clearly see the kitchen. It seemed kind of like In-N-Out, but everyone was moving much slower. It was as if everyone was moving in slow motion.Much to my dismay, they did not offer Dr. Pepper, my favorite soft drink. I was surprised that they offered other lesser known drinks, but not Dr. Pepper? Come on. After waiting about 6 or 7 minutes, my food arrived in a bag. A bag? Really? I was planning on eating inside, not take out. Even McDonald's does better than that. Digging through the bag I first took out the fries, which were in a cup, and I took a bite. My first impression of the fries was they were nothing special, and too salty. I like salt on my fries as it adds flavor, but there was simply too much salt. As a result, in addition to the fact that the serving was quite large, I finished only about half of my fries.Now onto the burger. I paid about $10 for my meal, so I was thinking to myself that this better be the best burger I have ever tasted in a long time. Unwrapping the product in its tin foil wrapping, I noticed that the presentation of the burger was sub par. The burger did not look appetizing, at all. Almost disgusting, as a matter of fact. The cheese was dripping over the bun, and I couldn't even see all the ingredients on the burger. Taking my first bite, it didn't taste bad. A pretty classic American burger taste, I must say. It did taste rather close to Wendy's. Upon finishing my meal, I was not impressed. My stomach felt greasy, and I felt the need to go hike a mountain a couple times, which I did, as Tempe Butte is close by. I felt my stomach almost on the point of rejecting it, it was that greasy. Seriously. Overall, Five Guys is way to expensive, unbelievably greasy, and makes your stomach cringe. The atmosphere is nice though, thus the two stars. If you had to choose between Five Guys and In-N-Out, INO is the clear winner in every category.
other I pass by it everyday and my son goes to the daycare in the same center so I had been wanting to try it.  I just recently started liking wine so of course I was excited about trying something new. We were greeted right away, and seated at a table that felt like we had to shout to one another - haha... so we moved to the cozy little couch in the corner which was a 100% improvement.  Intimate but casual and very comfy... and close to the tv (basketball).  They played Sade all night which I really enjoyed... I love her.Our waiter seemed kinda weird at first and he did "forget about us" a couple times... but he made up for it with complementary glasses of wine, so we forgave him.  We tasted an Ausi white wine but I didn't care for it.  Then we tried the Gewürztraminer which I really liked.  I guess I go for German whites???  But I'll be the first to admit I have no idea what the heck I'm talking about when it comes to wine :o)  But I do look forward to lots of learning!Anyway, we ordered the bruscetta for a little snack which were all very good.  *Smoked Salmon, mascarpone & taramosalata*Dates drenched in soy sauce with spicy Chorizo (my 2nd fav,mmm spicy!)*Fig, Prosciutto & Brie (both our favs)*Sun dried tomato, gorganzola & walnuts (we actually ordered the artichoke but got this by mistake, but we both liked it - and I'm not a huge sun-dried tomato fan either)I can't wait to go back and try more wine and more of the delicious sounding food!  Crocodile, kangaroo, panini's... YUM!
other Highest gas  prices in the valley!
3 3 and a half stars. I finally had my first ever Valley Oregano's experience tonight. You'd think I'd have gone to the one on Camelback ages ago, because, well, I live minutes away from it, but no, it was the Tempe location which sucked me in. Ok, not necessarily sucked me in. I drove my ass all the way out there to meet some friends for dinner, but still. Wait was an hour which kind of bit. We were tempted to just go to Thai Basil instead but as I never had Oregano's we persisted and stayed put. Once seated, we ordered things that I won't be eating anything close to resembling for the rest of the week: the spinach salad (ok, maybe I'd eat that), the cheesy bread, a large thin crust pesto pizza, and the pizokie for dessert. I'm a huge deep dish fan (I know, I know, thin crust is how real Italian pizza is) so I'm going to reserve major potential star wattage for when I actually have one of those. I thought the pesto thin crust was pretty decent - didn't blow me out of the water but it was good. The salad was flavorful and the cheesy bread was decent, but the pizokie dessert thing was awesome. Maybe it's because I I haven't had one of these since BJ's back in college (which is a longtime ago), but it was pretty damn delicious. Scene was pretty much college-y, loud, and full of "like, I was all"s, but duh, what else is it going to be.All in all, almost all stuff not good for me but whatever. Now that I've finally had my Oregano's experience I can go on with my life. Nothing like a local pizza chain holding you back.
other Great date place! I was worried that I wouldn't like what they picked for me because I don't like vegetables but the chef worked right around that. The cheese plate was very good but the bread that it came with was fantastic!! The short ribs were great. I loved all of my wine pairings as well.
other Hot Breakfast..........NOT, Again cold food when it supposed to be hot....people beware of this over price place and lack of care for the customer it seems that this is the way of doing business.*** Again a nice place to visit but DO NOT EAT HERE.*** And DO NOT CARE!
other Best pizza Ive had in Arizona hands down. My best friend lives in AZ, my friends and I stopped by this place and enjoyed surprisingly wonderful tasting pizza a must try. When I went here they were playing underground hip-hop which I am a fan of. It made it a great atmosphere to enjoy my food. I highly recommend this place I live in California and this place still comes to mind. Great for college students and the fam bam.
3 This place is consistant with it's good Chinese food. The staff is courteous the place is clean. Want Chinese take out in Tolleson come here. =0)
other You get a lot of food thats what I love! The guy was very very helpful although you know sometimes you just want a minute to think, that was noexisitant. The chicken is realld good, the ribs were better than okay, but not great. The beef was kinda salty. All in all though great bang for your buck!
other Had to update because we've now tried the pizza! For all the times we have visited we've never tried a pizza (too many other really good options to choose I guess...)We ordered the Italian Classic (veggies & meat). We ordered it a little well done/crispy and were not disappointed! It was hot, fresh and cooked perfectly! Service was great as usual even though they were completely SLAMMED with customers the day before Thanksgiving filing numerous growlers of their pumpkin beer which sold out in less than record time!We were there again last weekend for the football games and made it in time to order our favorite breakfast items - eggs benedict and the braised pork dish with beans, potatoes, two eggs and fresh warm tortillas.  It was fantastic! This dish, just like many others (possibly ALL others) is plenty for other to share. Service was exceptional and the crowd fun and rowdy rooting for their teams and AZ won - so there were a lot of happy customers that day!
other This place is a freaking joke. Expect an overcrowded waiting room and at minimum an hour wait. They see children but there is nothing in the waiting room to entertain them so they are all screaming and crying. There's not even room for a stroller. Horrible, horrible experience!
other First off nothing gourmet going on here at all. Its basically Subway with free delivery and they have to deliver it for free or there is no way in hell you would bother with the place. It's cheap, generic, flavorless food.
other One stop has one goal and that is to get the $80. diagnosis fee and split.  Francisco told me i needed to spend over $1300. for parts the manufacturer only charges $316 for. Stay away! I intend to file a complaint with the Attorney Generals office today, hopefully they will stop this nonsense.
other One of my top choices for downtown Phoenix. Always an upscale, posh vibe, but with very generous prices on entrees. Good looking people throughout this bar. The Kisras are VERY tasty and a good spin off the typical flatbreads at many restaurants now. Brunch here on Saturdays or Sundays-- great drink specials too.
other Excellent wings. I realized how much I miss this place when I ate horrible chicken wings in San Jose. It gets crowded Tuesday and Thursday because of special deal on wings, but definetly worth it. They do not have any Native NewYorker in CA :(
other Food was good, service was great! If I didn't eat at Chili's so much inn the past, I would definitely go back, but since coming back to the US, many more other restaurants to try.....
other This was by far the worst restaurant experience I've ever had.  I paid $20.00 for a show and dinner. I received the show only because it was from an outside source. The show was other hours long and by the time it was over half the restaurant I'd say 50 to 80 people still had not been served. They didn't have enough menu's for people to even order off of. Some guy in shorts walked around with buckets of silverware wiping them on his shorts then placing them on the table. The show started at 7:00, at 9:30 I still had no food. The people who did get food complained that it was terrible. Maybe I should be happy I didn't get any food. When I asked again about our order the waitress said she would take care of it. The guys in the kitchen were overheard saying "f---k those people no more orders! not only did we not get the dinner we already paid for they flat out refused to give us dinner or our money back. We ended up at Dennys eating eggs at 11:00 . Seriously I've never had such a bad experience in my life. Can you imagine paying for a dinner then being refused the dinner or a refund? unbelievable
3 Despite it's name (which gave me moment for pause when deciding if I wanted to check it out), Xtreme Bean is a hip coffee house with a college feel (they even have a "study room" with quasi-cubicles that is ironically placed in what used to be a bank vault). Further, for those of you that spend hours on end in coffeehouses, THEY HAVE FREE WI-FI :-DThe "coffee flavored coffee" and tropical ice tea are good (I personally tend not to stray into more interesting coffee drinks, so you'd have to check those out yourself) and the entire selection of both food and drinks is very reasonably priced (compared to corporate coffee).As of this post, there is ragtime piano on Monday nights as well as performers on the weekends.They have a drive-through window.Oh yeah, they don't appear to have updated their website in quite some time... most importantly, their hours of operation. The website says they are open 24-hours on the weekend... but I *think* they are closing at 1am in the summer.EDIT: Go for the pumpkin muffins... they are most excellent.EDIT 2: Due to the recent rise in popularity of this coffeehouse, I can no longer get my beloved muffins as they all sell out long before I arrive at night. *tear* Oh yeah... and all the employees probably think I'm that crazy muffin guy. *shrugs*EDIT 3: I'm officially downgrading my review from a other to a 3 as it's now difficult to get a table indoors and I have no interest in sitting in the smoker's lounge which is their patio area. *sigh*
other I just got back from an Arizona spring training vacation, and one of the highlights was definitely the Desert Botanical Gardens.  We came really close to skipping on a visit altogether because it was 5:00pm, but decided to give it a shot...it was worth it!  I was a little disappointed that the Butterfly Pavillion had closed for the day at 5:00pm, and several walking areas were being used for weddings/receptions (who could blame these people??) but still got to see a lot of beautiful desert plants and wildlife.  We managed to get in for free, not sure if it was because of the time of the day or all the people just walking in for the weddings though, which totally made the park that much more fun.  I am not sure I would have gotten as much enjoyment out of it if I'd had to pay $other to get in...The little desert rat-sqirrels, and rabbits were totally fun to try to find hiding in the many different plants and burrows.  I felt like a little kid ooh-ing and ah-ing at the different varieties of cacti and desert wildflowers, and have to give this place the ultimate rating .  If you're ever in Arizona, please give this place a try, it's very well put together and a beautiful site to see.
other great service, efficient bartender, the place was packed and he flew around that place serving brewski's nonstop...awesome outdoor patio and great view of camelback...happy to see this little gem and will be back
other This is the best mall in Arizona.  Lots of high end shops and nice restaurants.  Except during the holidays, plenty of covered parking.
other Greatness in the form of food, just like the other locations. The service was particularly good at this location. We sat at the bar,and while the other customers were mildly annoying, the late night bartenders were up beat, witty, and very personable.The atmosphere was par for the course.All in all, if you are reading this review, get your directions to this location, close the browser, and go eat!
other Awesome food and service!
other First time eating Chicken and waffles and it was the best time ever.
other Okay, it almost seems a shame to burst the bubble of the positive reviews of this place, but I just have to. I'm not an Indian food expert, but I am a serious enthusiast and I've eaten at dozens of Indian places on three continents, not to mention my family being from the vicinity of that area of the world and therefore having grown up on curry and rice and all things spice.We went here for lunch yesterday (Sunday), thanks to a Yelp/Aloqa recommendation after we'd had a romp at Estrella Mountain Park and were starving. The place was almost deserted at 1pm, with only one other table occupied - fair enough. We went for the buffet. And I have to say, it was simply "okay". The buffet didn't have a particularly wide variety of stuff - several items were cheap regulars such as the saag and the dhal - spinach and lentils for the uninitiated. They did have aloo zucchini, never seen that before - tasted okay, about as good as I'd have been able to make it (and that's actually not a compliment). No lamb dishes - disappointing, but unfortunately this is also rare.Flavorwise, I found it boring and unspectacular. Saag is saag, tandoori chicken is tandoori chicken, except their chicken was very light on the tandoori smoke flavour. None of the food left the slight zing on my tongue that it should have. Rice was okay, but then you typically can't go wrong with cooking basmati (although another reviewer's mileage apparently differed on this count). We had our almost-3-year-old along and he did have a little rice, chicken and beef - it was his first real curry and thus a pretty substantial milestone for us. Then the wife went to get a little kheer and a gulab jamun ball. The kheer was watery but tasted okay - compared unfavourably to the sabudaana kheer at India Palace. The jamun ball was almost completely solid - you had to press real hard with a fork to cut it, normally they're nice and soft and soaked. However, another one I got was normal - so it was just the luck of the draw there. Beef curry was nice, although the first piece I ate was mainly fat - whatever, you get that and I don't mind it. The fried pakoras can normally be cut through with a fork. These you had to saw through with a knife - not great, chewy to the point of almost being crunchy. No samosas in the buffet. The naan was unusual. I've had a LOT of naan before and this stuff was the uncommon kind, not thick and pita-ey but instead a little more like a roti. It tasted very fresh - we had plain and also garlic - and the wife really liked it. Kid did too. I personally prefer the other sort of naan - softer and a little more substance to it, but this one had merit regardless. However, it took at least fifteen minutes after our food was served before the naan arrived.All up, middle of the road as far as I'm concerned, although the wife quite liked it. Note that this is for the buffet only - we did not have a-la-carte and perhaps the to-order cooked food may have tasted better. I've had better buffets - the best one in Phoenix west of the 17 IMO is India Palace - a wider variety, a lot busier (as a result, I'm sure) and more flavourful food. Admittedly, I haven't tried any other Indian places south of Bell but west of the 17 except for Sutra. Bell appears to have most of them?I would normally have given this place a flat three stars, but I'm going to give it an extra half and round up for a few reasons. Firstly, the waiter was real nice and very attentive - up to the standard of a typical US chain place, rather than the silent wanderers with the Easter Island statue facial expressions at other buffets who do no more than refill your water and clear your dirty dishes every fifteen minutes or so. He was asking us how we were doing, offered refills of my wife's iced tea at appropriate times etc. Spot on. Next, there's a buffet discount where all kids under 10 are $other - however, we noticed that they appropriately knocked the price down to $3.50 for us, unbidden and I guess for the simple reason that he was set up in a high chair and obviously only ate 1/other of a breakfast bowl worth of food in total. Third, the place had nice decor (although I was a bit concerned there were no tablecloths, with my kid banging his plastic sippy cup and spilling sh1t all over the tabletop) and thankfully they didn't have sh1tapple wudda-wudda-waa-waa pretentious bhangra muzak playing in a cheap attempt at making you feel like you're actually in India.I'd eat here again, but only if I'm in the area and DYING for Indian food. It simply didn't measure up, either buffet-wise or flavour-wise. For first-timers, I can see how they would have enjoyed the experience - clean seating area, Americanized flavours and a good waiter. My experience, however, has been burned in over almost four decades and I've kicked the tyres of more cuisines from this area of the world than I can recount, especially Indian. Three and a half, rounded up to four, Seacrest out.
other The best Asaian store around. Love the selection. Awesome smoked herring for cheap. Everything is so much cheaper and better than any other Asian store I've been.
other When I think of Richardson's, I feel warm and cozy inside.  I've been on several occasions and I love the atmosphere... I always have a good time at this hidden little gem of the city.The 'Cuisine of New Mexico' is unique... they are known for their green chile potato as well as several other pork dishes.  I usually go for the fish or seafood specials... they have a standard menu and then specials posted on chalk boards around the restaurant.Most recently I enjoyed the blackened scallop appetizer as my entree along with a huge house salad.  The scallops were a little bit salty but cooked just right.  They were served on a tortilla with rice, beans, and a yummy spicy sauce.  Their salads are really tasty, and many of the entree specials come with a starter salad.  I went with a group of other and we had a couple of bottles of wine and a plain pizza as an appetizer to share.  Needless to say, none of us had room for dessert!Be prepared for a crowd whenever you go, but enjoy your company and the people around you.  Call ahead and make a reservation if you can...  if you do have to wait, sit at the bar or by the fireplace; you can't complain once you have a drink in hand and the scent of the fire mixed with hot food and good energy.  I'll be back again soon, Richardson's!
other Sub Factory is one of the better sub shops in Tempe - They have been around forever and have a reputation of using the highest quality, freshest ingredients. They may need to give this location a "make-over" soon though... it's getting a little tired. (FYI - their secret weapon is their bread)
other This place was AMAZING!  I have stayed in probably over 100 hotels, this one was the BEST hotel I have ever been to... staff was extremely friendly, I WILL be back!
other Dinner for four at the soft opening.The food kept us talking about the tastes and combinations far into the night.Small/shared plates will fill you up quickly.  The Hamachi Crudo was a fresh, light starter with peppers, fennel and sea beans to fire up your appetite! Grilled asparagus and a delicate, cheesy risotto were great sides but the smoked beef rib was a taste sensation.  Sweet and savory, smoky and succulent, sticky and sumptuous! Bleu cheese grits and grilled peaches were the perfect pairing.  ahhhh, sigh.  I think I'd pass up the tater tots and save room for something else.  This restaurant is just what Phoenix needs.  Close to the ball parks or walk off your dinner in an invigorated downtown, Blue Hound Kitchen is a great addition to the energy.
other double-double, protein style, with pickles and spread only please. and a medium iced tea. in-n-out gets it. i like my burger the way i like it, and they don't mind serving it my way. they have never screwed up my order. they have the best iced tea, and fresh lemon wedges that aren't pathetically small. they pay their workers a fair wage, and you can tell - they're all nice and happy. love me some yummy, cheap eats and service with a smile!
other I cannot say enough good things about this place! The food is amazing and the customer service is probably the best I've ever experienced. Every time my boyfriend and I dine here the owner visits with us and asks how we are, etc. I've only had Pho at a couple of places in town so I can't speak to the authenticity but it tastes amazing and fresh every time. Places that make good food and offer the kind of customer service these places do (and family owned is always a plus for me!) are just priceless. UnPhogettable is always worth the drive to Mesa.
other Inspired by recent Talk, this rating simply must be updated.Fatburger has a QUALITY-quality that places it in a wierd limbo between other fast food burgers and places like Fuddruckers.If you are a fan of the king, either of the two clowns, or the red haired girl, then Fatburger is likely to feel too expensive and that it takes too long.However, 'you get what you pay for' and 'good things are worth waiting for'.  Freshness, a multitude of assembly choices, and overall quality are big standouts at Fatburger.  The employees at this location have always been friendly and courteous.Tuesdays: buy a combo, get another burger free!
other We went out last night to the movies, and with an hour and a half to spare, we thought we had time to stop at this newish restaurant on the corner of Indian School and 24th St. It was a family owned place, baby in bassinet by the cashier, and absolutely no explanations of what the food is. Just strange names. We ordered and sat down. 35-40 minutes later, we realized the food still hadn't come and we'd never make it out to Scottsdale for our movie. So, disappointed, we took the food when it finally came and brought it home and ordered something up on Amazon. When I dove into the "to go" boxes, I stopped complaining. Man, that food was delicious. I ordered the Chicken Tikka, only because I pretty much knew what it would be, and it far beat my expectations. Our Chicken Kabab (ordered again because we knew what it would be) was delicious as well. To the owners, thank you for being here. We'll be back. Please develop something that describes the food, and make a non-egg version of the Naan bread please! Lots of vegans and allergies out there who don't expect food from  your region to have heavy eggs included. Readers, as long as you set your expectations correctly about time for food preparation, you'll be very happy with Khyber Halal. Get in there and support this neighborhood gem!
other My wife's work had their Christmas party here last night. Although the customer service was slow and average at best, the food was outstanding. I had a burger and my wife the steak salad. I was the DD, but my wife said the margaritas were excellent. Dessert was tiramisu and sweet potato cheesecake. Great little place with a nice vibrant ambiance.
other Time flies when you're having fun...It's been almost a full year since my initial review of Bacon, and I've been back probably ten times or more.I've seen a lot of transition with the employees but I can say that their service has gotten much better since the beginning.  The casual atmosphere is right up my alley for a weekend breakfast, and my yogi omelette / protein pancake orders have stayed consistent too.  I was there earlier today and while the service was spot-on, I did find a piece of ham in my otherwise veggie omelette - but I overlooked it and enjoyed my meal nonetheless...My husband has been to Bacon even more than i have, and he told me he recently sampled what's to come on their new lunch menu (think pastrami sandwich).  So, go for breakfast, go for lunch, go for a Bloody Mary or a Mimosa... just kick back and enjoy your meal!
other Sorry for my lateness but I wanted to update everyone that after my review I was contacted by management, apologized to, and asked back for another chance. I WILL be back just as soon as it cools down and update my review then.Everyone deserves a second chance to make things right.I appreciate the professionalism and attention to customer service. I'm looking forward to it.
other Unprofessional, disorganized, and extremely low end care.
other My wife took me here on my birthday for breakfast and it was excellent.  The weather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their grounds an absolute pleasure.  Our waitress was excellent and our food arrived quickly on the semi-busy Saturday morning.  It looked like the place fills up pretty quickly so the earlier you get here the better.Do yourself a favor and get their Bloody Mary.  It was phenomenal and simply the best I've ever had.  I'm pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it.  It was amazing.While EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious.  It came with other pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete.  It was the best "toast" I've ever had.Anyway, I can't wait to go back!
other yuk! service and food sucked never again!
other I've been a bunch of times for takeout and took a seriously picky foodie friend this past weekend.  Everything I've had here has been excellent and I mean, excellent.  In the past I've had the margherita pizza, eggplant parm and fried calamari.  All good.  This weekend we had the comp tapenade, beef carpacchio, lasagna and one of the pizzas (can't remember name -- had olives, art hearts, ham and ?).  All delicious.  The lasagna was so delicate but melded perfectly with the sauce.My very particular picky friend LOVED the place.  Seriously loved it.
other I've eaten at this Smashburger a few times and I'm always pleased with my food and the friendliness of the staff.  On my most recent visit, I called ahead to pick up my family's order and we were not disappointed, once again.  We ordered a variety of menu items (and in typical 'When Harry Met Sally...' style) - a grilled chicken spinach and goat cheese sandwich (subbing the goat cheese for American & changing the multigrain bun to egg), a build-your-own burger with an egg bun, spicy chipotle mayo, pickles and onions, an order of Smashfries, an order of french fries and an order of fried pickles.  Everything was made perfectly to order and plenty of extra sauces (ranch, etc;) were provided without having to ask.  On weekends, this shop is jam packed and it's a wait to get a table, but worth it.  During the week, everything flows very smoothly and the vultures "circling" for booths is at a minimum.  I highly recommend this Smashburger location whether dining in or taking taking your meal on the go.
other Heard about this interesting steak house from Lindsay, my Yelping 'go to' and I am grateful. What a fun night, feeling "Mad Men' ish as we walked through the kitchen when entering the restuarant. Atmosphere was amazing and the food.... WOW. My fav had to be the amazing steak and bean chili/soup.... fantastic.Steaks were our of this world and the mushrooms... devine.When entering the restaurant we greeted by helpful eager staff ... with each one adding input into our experience.... especially Patti, our server. She was helpful, informative, fun and sealed the deal of a fantastic night. Thanks
other I visited Smeeks this weekend as part of Carmelpalooza. Amazing! It's a fun little store with darling treats and trinkets to drop your cash upon. Bacon belt? Yep.Women's mustaches? Of course!Butterscotch Peanut butter cups? Yes!Very fun. A bit pricey, but I couldn't resist buying some monster finger puppet key toppers.Yay Yay Yay!
other Ruth's Chris, the only steak house I can fully endorse.  500 degree plates make the sizzle a memorable experience.  The Ahi tuna appetizer is also a must have to start the meal off right.  While every salad they have is a can't miss, I'll go there just to get the Chop Salad.
other Finally had a chance to watch a game here! Just moved to Surprise in July, and have been waiting for spring training. Very easy parking, and the seats are great! It does not matter where you sit. The diner have great food. I will be coming here a lot!
other Pf changs is pretty good, there changs spicy chicken is a really good dish, the service is great! I go there almost every two weeks.
other Best noodles in Phoenix. This place is hands down the best chinese food in Phoenix. PF Changes has nothing on these guys, they are fast, friendly and food is hot. Its also excellent for leftovers too.
other I don't get it. Not the concept of a good vegetarian restaurant but the need to create mock this and mock that. The word mock appears on the menu no less than 30 times, and that made me want to flee pell mell at mach other out of there, sonic boom be damned. I understand it from a  marketing strategy to appeal to and or convert the carnivores and omnivores I suppose. Do meat eaters feel better about eating something vegetarian as long as it is shaped like a chicken wing? Has anyone gone to a steak joint and had mock carrots made from pork medallions?  I am also aware that we eat with our eyes, have preconceived notions of certain types of cuisine etc. However, I firmly believe that if an establishment uses veggies, legumes, tofu and such and gets creative instead of trying to reinvent the meat wheel, the end result would be much better. For Example the Mexicali burger, no mock meat reference here. How about listing something as "whatever the hell it is" served Parmesan style?  I stopped here for lunch yesterday as I was in the area. Cool space, it was open colorful and inviting. A couple of organs line a small space up front. Nice mild funk flavor to the decor. Ordering is done counter style and they bring it out to you. You pretty much go behind the counter to get ice for your beverage which I thought was a bit of a weird queue. I ordered the spicy Thai peanut, a dish that offered mock choices, but I went with the crispy tofu. The brown rice that was the bedding here was ok, lukewarm at best. the dish lacked any real flavor and there was no spice whatsoever.The tofu tasted as if it was freezer burned, which really dumbfounded me. I think it may have been crisped long before it was served to me and microwaved, the texture was just off. Copious amounts of cock sauce, err... Sriracha saved it from blandsville.I am not saying I would never return, as I tend to give places more than one chance. I love well prepared vegetarian dishes, just don't mock me.
other I liked this place...it's a little dark.  I went in the middle of the day so there was probably more workers there than movie goers.  And the staff looked pretty bored actually.3 bucks ain't bad for a movie.  I thought the place was clean and a decent selection of movies and refreshments.  I come from a small town so even this theatre is an upgrade for me.For three dollars I will most definately be hitting this place more often.
3 I think the lady behind the counter didn't like me.  Could've just been me.  I don't know.  It's just how I felt.When my boss first told me about this place, I thought he said "Al Molina" and I was like, "You mean the guy who played Doc Ock in Spider-Man II?"I've been here a few times, today was the first time I'd been to El Molino in about 8 months.  I happened to be in the area, popping in to buy a backpack at Staples an decided to get a burrito to go to munch on when I got back to my office.One thing I really didn't like was that you had to ask for the key to use the bathroom.  That's something very typical of, like, a gas station that bums use to shit on the floor.  I went to the bathroom and it said I had to ask for the key.  I went back to the counter and the woman disappeared in the back so I kinda just did a little pee-pee dance until she came back.It was a little too expensive for what it was.  A thing of chips was like $4.50.  That's crazy.  Granted, the chips are really good and you get a lot of em, but... don't you have a thing of chips I can buy for a buck that comes with a much more reasonable portion?  I got all these chips in the fridge at work that won't be edible on Monday, probably.The burrito I got was very tasty.  The salsa they gave me was also super good.  Nice and smokey and spicy.  Seriously.  Man, that shit was spicy.  I kind of have a soar throat today so that spiciness felt super good to me.I had to laugh when I opened up my to-go back once I got back to work because I actually thought maybe I didn't get ANY salsa, but when I took a look they gave me soooo much.  I made a small tower beside my meal, like a Stonehenge of heat.Three stars:  Good.  Not great.  Weird bathroom.  Unfriendly lady.  Good food.  Too expensive.
3 We got the Wiseguy with Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, and Fennel Sausage.  I was very underwhelmed.  The pizza was really greasy and just not all that great-tasting.  Also the crust was burnt in several places, making it taste even worse.
other I was definitely expressed with their buffet! I had been craving Indian food for quite a while, but since it can be a bit expensive having to order all the dishes separately I was determined to find a place with a lunch buffet nearby to give it a try. I was lucky enough to find this place, which I noticed had fairly good reviews on Yelp. This place is definitely nicer and bigger compared to other Indian buffets I'd been to. It has a wide seating area and nicely arranged tables. The buffet had a great selection and I was able to try new dishes that I'd never tried before. Everything was delicious. Tandoori chicken was dry, but then again I've yet to experience it moist and juicy at a buffet. The garlic Naan bread was soft and warm, SO good! Service was excellent! Server was attentive and polite - my glass of water was never empty. Will definitely be coming back!
other This review if for their happy hour because that's all that I've experienced.  Love that they have happy hour all night on Sundays and Mondays.  I live close by and used to frequent Wildfish often for happy hour.  I usually get the crab cake and lobster bisque.
other I returned to this place a couple of times, most recently was this week. Somehow the coffee hasn't tasted as good as the first time. What I really like about this place is that when I'm near downtown Phoenix on a week night, and need a spot with good coffee, a very clean restroom, not too crowded, decent current magazines to read,  and definitely good funky yet nondistracting music that is turn on at a decent lounging volume provides an overall comfortable experience.
other Love this place.  Bring some patience because the wait is sometimes long and there is little seating.  The outside patio is excellent in the fall and early spring!But I gave it other stars for a reason - and that is because the awesomeness of the food absolutely outweighs the wait time.  I acknowledge that this is a personal choice - but if you go and try any of the sandwiches, you'll likely agree.
other If you want bruschetta, you cannot go wrong here!  You get to pick four. Request to have them cut in fours, much easier to eat!FAVESProsciutto with Figs & MascarponeBrie & Apples with Fig Spread Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios Salami with PestoThe green picholine olives ARE SO GOOD!Raspberry Chicken Salad is good.  It's a little sweet, but I always ask for the dressing on the side and just use a very small amount. We usually share this as well. The Brie and Prosciutto panini The pieces of paper  with 'your gum here' So cute!Mon/Tue after 8pm $20 bottle of wine AND bruschetta! Awesome!Cons-Loud. Really loud. Acoustics in this place are terrible when it's busy, and it usually is.  It's a little better when the doors are open.  I guess they can't really do anything about it since it used to be a post office.  Hence the name 'Postino'  Desserts are mediocreCrazy busy parking lotIf you don't want to valet, you will have to park down the street on campbell near the residential streets.
3 The Jury is still out on this cleaners. Took in 6 pieces, I expected to pick up six pieces the next day. They did a nice job of other out of the six garments, ranging from mens slacks to sports coats to dresses; but destroyed one dress. Shouldn't have run it through the dryer - who knew - I expected Catalina to know. Still don't have the problem resolved. So - this is a mixed review. Very happy on 5/6ths of the job - never have had a sports coat done for $2.50 before - but still looking for closure on the last item. Who knows - they may delight me.
other I have heard about this place for couple years before I actually get to try it out. Their guacamole burger is my favorite, and the Peanut Butter Malt was just amazing!! First time I tried, I ended up getting another one to go. They also have corn beef sandwich on Thursday, which I haven't get the chance to try yet. Only thing I dislike is that they close at 8 pm which is a bit too early for me.
other I was contacted by the manger at this location cause of my bad review, I am really for proactive owners. I really need to go back to this location to give them another try since the first time I went there it was really good. I was given a gift card to wipe out what I paid for the last meal as kinda of do over. I will be back Anthony and I will let you know how my next visit is.
other Delicious salad, pizza, and wine. We got the Padre pizza which is not on the menu, but fig, prosciutto, arugula, and ricotta... so delicious!! The crust is perfect! The best part is they have several BOTTLES of wine under $12. Yes, you could usually barely get a glass for that amount. Sold... ! We had the Four Vines ZIn that was amazing for only $10.99.
3 Same Majerle's menu as the other locations.  Decent food (especially wings), but high prices for both food and drink.  Good service -- even overattentive on my last visit.  Great setup for watching football games.
other Best seafood place I have found in the Phoenix area.Everything from the crap dip to the crab legs and oysters is delicious. They have a wonderful fish selection as well and even their steaks are good.Service has always been excellent every time I have gone.Can get very busy on nights so try and go early if you can.
3 This is a really fun place to grab some cocktails or beers before an event or game. My friends and I have a tradition of drinking here before DBACKS games and we always love it. Drinks are reasonable, especially if you ask the specials, and way cheaper than beers at BOB. As for food they have an awesome menu, but the food came off a bit cheap in quality to me so I don't think it's worth ten dollars a plate. But if your hungry it will get the job done! Although...one of the days I want to try and eat one of those One Pound hot dogs they have. It is a personal goal. I recommend:Fox Sports MargBeersGrape Bombers
other Celebrated my anniversary here. Everything was amazing. Enjoyed the filet mignon and the lobster with prawns. Luis was our server and made our experience truly amazing. He made everything perfect. He gave us our space, but at the same time entertained us when appropriate. He recommended a great wine to pair with the lobster, and made sure we were well taken care. We capped our meal off with creme brulee and a dessert wine. We will definitely come back here and ask for Luis again.
3 As Target's go this one is standard fare. That consistency is part of their brand recognition. However, as a part of the Up-Scale Desert Ridge Shopping Center, I'd expect a bit more than a Standard Target. Don't they have some sort of a Flagship Target?Also traffic and parking can be atrocious at Desert Ridge. I drive to Target's and WalMart's much further from my house because the round trip time is less when I don't have to negotiate the teen packed Desert Ridge lot. Probably safer too.
other I have not liked one bar at all in Scottsdale, AZ. This was the first one! A semblance of a normal crowd. We ended up talking with some weirdo local chick, thought they were trying to do some kind of bizarre swinger plot, and they kicked rocks. Some friendly people in there though, all enjoying a good time singing and dancing. Maybe it was because I was inebriated, but the Karaoke was outstanding. These two chicks really belted it out last night. I had a really good time drinking here with my friend. They sell Heineken 2other oz bottles here. I thought that was pretty cool. My friend said "Headband is the best" about this place, I have no idea what the means though.
other OOOOOWWWEEEE!! Have yall tried ATL Wings yet!!! If not what are you waiting for!  They are the BOMB Diggity!I don't know why I haven't updated my review either, so here I go! The honey habanero are still my #other but I also love the Cajun Hot!  Holy Crap!! Get some of the Cajun Hot wings and some ranch and their hot sauce on the side, dip your wing in the ranch and then the hot sauce and watch out!! The only time you really feel the burn is when you're no longer eating, gums & tongue just be blaze hot and mouth just be water for more, yes my friends that's the heat I love!!Luv me some wings from ATL!
other Just had my first hot dog at Short Leash Dogs and quite honestly, I can't call it a "hot dog" because that just conjures up images of, well... a hot dog. And Short Leash Dogs are so much more and better than "a hot dog" the way most people know hot dogs. Know what I mean? No? Well, go have a Short Leash Dog. Really unique combinations, various dog options (all local meats and produce) - bratwurst, beer hot, veggie... My friend and I shared an Aiko (we chose the brat as our dog), with mango chutney, red onions, cilantro, mayo and jalapeño on a naan (you might have read that in other reviews, no traditional buns here!). You can find the Short Leash Dogs truck at the Phoenix Public Market on Wednesday evenings and Saturday mornings, and if you follow them on Twitter (@shortleashdogs) you can find out when/where else they make regular stops... scottsdale, central phoenix... Track 'em down and eat their food. And talk to them - Brad and Kat are smart enthusiastic folks with a great sense of humor and offer superb food and service! What's not to love?
other Great food, great service, very nice ambiance!
other They served us stale rice.  Average main dishes, not as flavorful.  Not enough meat in the lamb dishes.  Overpriced.
other Angel sweet is without a doubt the best gelato I've had outside of Italy.
other The Montelucia Resort is home to Crave Cafe, and the fact that I was blown away by how beautiful the resort is has nothing to do with how impressed I was with Crave.What are you craving at the moment?  Perhaps a cup of coffee?  a scoop of gelato?  an empanada? gourmet pastry?  homemade tomato soup?  perhaps a panini sandwich filled with turkey, cheese,  grilled eggplant, and cranberry compote? red wine? magazine? fresh fruit? Diet Coke?Whatever your 'crave-ing' - Crave has it all!In addition to pretty much anything your heart desires, Crave also has an extremely friendly staff and offers limited seating (in and outside) with gorgeous views of Camelback mountain.After a full tour of the resort, we were hungry for lunch and decided to have a quick bite at Crave... We shared a sandwich, slice of quiche, and tomato soup - all of it was delicious!  I am sure I'll be craving a return trip to the Montelucia sometime soon, and when I do, I'm sure I'll pop into Crave for whatever I need at that time.
3 went there for sunday morning hangover breakfast. the mariachi band, while maybe nice outside or not so loud, was so overpowering that we could not talk... the trumpet was terrible for hangover ears... not peaceful or calm at all- so we sat outside. food was good. service was decent. a little pricey but okay because thats what every downtown restaurant has to do. i would go back... just not near that mariachi band.
other Saketini opened not too long ago, so they're still having grand opening specials.  Get 'em while they're hot!I haven't had their food yet, but I have partaked in their fantastic drink specials.  They have $other well drinks for happy hour.  Woo hoo! Plus they have a reverse happy hour too, which scores them another star.  Any place that offers late night drink and food specials is alright in my book.  Once I try the food, I'll be back and I'll update the review.
other I went to this place after seeing a segment on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives (Food Network).  I thought that the fusion of Chinese & Mexican food would be good.  I was a bit disapointed.  The food was okay, but nothing too special.  The establishment itself was clean and the service was quick, so kudos to them for that.
other Ok so wanted to try this place out since I heard they were really good so I did and man I should have gotten the whole scoop on how long there wings take. After 4other minutes I asked what was wrong with our order especially cause there was only three other customers in there the employee went ahead and told me they threw my wings away cause the other ones were too small. I was like really I would have taken it by the end of the hour we finally got our wings and compensated by giving me one wing extra. Needless to say we ended up going to another restaurant and getting served fast. Call ahead an hour and you'll be ok there wings are good but an hour for ten wings maybe not...
other This place is very cool! I went here after work with a sorority sister for drinks on a Friday night. Ended up staying for like 3.other hours.Fantastic atmosphere with outdoor and indoor seating. Lighting is dim and intimate indoors with rustic seating areas and large booth perfect for groups getting drinks together. The outdoor patio is sectioned off in a covered area with tables and smaller seats while an uncovered area hosted seating for peeps who rode their bikes in.The drinks are pretty yummy. If you're into fruity, girly cocktails there isn't much to choose from, but for a more mature, grown-u beverage, you're in luck. Hit the happy hour (which sadly ends at 5pm).It gets a tad loud and it difficult to tell the wait staff apart from the customers because they're all in street clothes but they're very attentive and sweet. We ordered the fondu plate and it was great. Pretzels, sausage, apples and the cheese... perfect for sobering up a bit from those yummy cocktails.
other I can only comment on two of the smoothies because I am on a banana kick and I choose from one of the two: the Bananrama or the Peanut Butter Chocolate. Oh so good! And now they do offer more than one size!  I have started getting this for dinner versus food! I love it!
3 Pleasant and beautiful. Feed the koi fish cheerios. Bathrooms are out of a catalog...I want that! Walk at a snail's pace, because it's not terribly large. When you're done, walk down to Pita Jungle or Lola Coffee!
other I like these sort of "mom & pop" spots, small and intimate setting.  Great pizza!  I always enjoy the veggie pizza with jalapenos, oh so good!  And mu hubby loves the suicide wings, but we've tried almost everything off of the menu and you CANNOT go wrong.  Prices rock too!
other Nice views of South Mountain, lots of elevation changes and some tricky par 3's make this a very solid muni and probably the toughest in town.  First my two complaints: the chipping area should have a few more holes with a slightly larger green, and the neighborhood is atrocious.  Aguila has four features not often found at municipal golf courses:1) You need to drive the ball well to score well here.  From a lot the tee boxes, the driving area often looks smaller than it is; so, confidence with the big stick is key.  2) Absence of generous flat lies in the fairway; even if you drive the ball well, you are not always rewarded and are sometimes faced with side-hill lies.  3) Very tough holes #9 and #18.  Hey, I like to score low as much as the next guy, but the thing about city courses is that they often give you easy closing holes with a good birdie chance; NOT the case here.  Rated 3 and other handicaps respectably, #9 and #18 take advantage of the same water hazard (similar to the closing holes at Karsten @ ASU) and put in play some penal, deep fairway bunkers that require precision drives and good approach shots.  #18 plays 470 yds+ from the tips, so if you hit a bomb, you still don't have a wedge in your hand.  4) Two true risk / reward par 4's - both with water, both greens are drivable from the tee.  #8 is not a guaranteed birdie from the greenside bunkers, but they're a good bailout.  #17 is longer and is a slightly more daunting drive with a more generous bailout option to the right, these are great holes.A tip: Take advantage of the par 5's; all but the last one is reachable in two (at least, that's been my experience).  There are only two par 3's that I would consider good birdie chances (#13 and #16), so if you can roll in a few putts, you're set.Go past Tent City, drive further south towards South Mountain, and you'll find a nice municipal course in South Phoenix.
other It seems to be a constant challenge to find a bar and restaurant in the east valley that is not only NOT a chain but that also has a great atmosphere, an attentive wait staff, a fabulous wine list, and a unique food selection (without being too out of the ordinary).   Vintage 9other has all of these!  Not to mention how refreshing it was to deal with a hostess, Jocelyn,  that wasn't 16 years old and actually knew what she was doing!  When we were seated our waitress, Emily was friendly, knowledgeable, attentive,  and never rushed us.  The wine list is extensive, however, I think they should add more low range wines in the $25-$3other range to their list.   The warm and cozy decor of the place makes you want to stay and eat and drink for hours.  The outdoor patio in the back has a great fire pit and romantic lighting.  I HIGHLY suggest making a reservation or you could be waiting a long time for a table.  There was a problem with one of our entrees and the manager took care of it immediately.  I look forward to my next visit to Vintage 95.
other Sushi is not just a meal, it's an experience...Everything from the way fish looks to the crisp green of the seaweed is art.  The smell of the sake and the sound of crisp sizzle on the grill create an environment conducive to stretching the palette.  Yasu's does this like no other sushi place...The fish is pristine, the rice like air, and the flavors intense and varied.  My wife and I live a stone's throw from this place you would never see it if you didn't know it was there.  It's like a little secret that is starting to get out...All I can say is that it is hands down the BEST sushi in Phoenix, period.  Get the fried oyster rolls, get the grilled mackerel or trout...just try it!
other Good food, if all the Taiwanese comes here that means this is really good.
other I actually haven't had any of the cocktails here yet but the menu looked really amazing. There are lots of sake cocktails and yummy-sounding martinis and they have a pretty good beer list, too.I had the tofu with red curry sauce and it was really good. I also had the oyster mushrooms which were also really good. I really like tapas as an idea, the small, inexpensive plates so you don't feel like you're spending a bunch of money even though you end up spending like fifty bucks. My friend happened to know the guy who was our waiter and he was very sweet. Overall I'd say it's a really great place to get a quick bite and have drinks with friends if you're feeling a little bit fancy.
other the folks at national car rental were very accommodating and even helped me upgrade my rental at little cost to me.  if the deal was right, i would definitely use this company again when visiting Phoenix!
3 Decades ago when this festival was up and coming, and I lived in Tempe, I would go to this street fair as we called it then two or three times while it was going on. Today I went with a friend. The festival has grown by blocks now. It's pretty big, I think they claim 400 vendors! That has to include the food vendors. I had my fry bread taco. It was super good and $9 bucks. I looked for something to buy but left with nothing. The things I liked most were huge home items and big ticket prices. I saw a few handbags of interest but not within my budget either. It use to be that this festival would have jewelry, matted photography and pottery a college student could afford. That's still my budget this year, unfortunately - but such priced things could not be located here this year. So I'm disappointed with the festival offerings. Parking covered & uncovered was $10 if you could not find free street parking. There wasn't enough ice cream vendors in my opinion but there was plenty of food vendors and the neighboring eateries were also busy and offering variety. The entertainment was very limited. I hope they will seek more entertainment in the future especially since they claim its one of the top 20 street festivals in the country.  Otherwise there isn't much to stick around for unless you have deep pockets or want creative ideas.
other First of all, the hours, this place keeps the most absurd hours for a restaurant serving 50,000+ students and faculty.  I cannot tell you how many times I've walked over to get a sandwich and Sacks has been closed.  They open sometime in the morning and close at about other or 3 in the afternoon, I can't report definitively what the hours are because they do not list them on Sacks' website, apparently they are trying to keep it a secret.  I understand a sandwich shop in downtown Phoenix keeping these hours, but here is an update for the owners of Sacks: ASU students and faculty do not keep bank hours.The quality of the food is substandard but the sandwiches are priced reasonably.
other If you desire true Chicago deep dish pizza, then Nello's should be at the top of your list! This is a staple pizza location in the Valley- and my family has been going for years. Nello's offers a great menu, drink list, and atmosphere. They offer an excellent Mon-Fri lunch special - a large drink, salad and 2-topping personal pizza for $8.99- what a steal! Don't pass this place up, it's worth it.
3 After all the raving I have heard about Matt's Big Breakfast and the long wait I was so excited to enjoy my food. The quality of the ingredients were high; however, the service was not so great. I felt that the waitresses were attempting to rush us out of the restaurant. I realize that it is a busy place, but their overt pushiness was not warranted. Overall I would not go back again. The food was made with great ingrediants, but it just didn't "do it " for me.
other I live down the street from Casey Moore's. I have been here a total of three times. The first time a group of us just ordered drinks, and the margaritas my friend and I ordered were so terrible that we sent them back. The second time I went with my husband and ordered a crab salad sandwich. Again, it was so awful I had to send it back. I am not a picky eater, nor have I been known to complain about food or service when dining out. There has only been one other restaurant I have ever been to where I sent food back. So, this place was already two for two. Alas, my husband begged me to go back once more. He was craving oysters and since this is an oyster house, I figured it wouldn't hurt to give them one more shot. It was last Thursday evening, and the place was hoppin'. This time, the food was decent. Not good, but decent enough where I may have given Casey Moore's a fourth chance had I been impressed with the service. But the service was HORRIBLE. Our waitress got us our drinks and didn't come back to take our orders for another 20 minutes. We sat there awkwardly waiting for her to stop by, and though she passed us quickly several times, she never even acknowledged us with a simple "I'll be back with your orders." When she did arrive 20 minutes later, she asked if we were ready to order without even an apology. I am not kidding you when I say she acted like she wanted nothing to do with us. She was very monotone and never smiled with us. I would like to pass this off as her having a bad night, but when she went to her other tables (all full of men with drinks) she suddenly lit up, laughed, and had a blast with them. It was so awkward to the point that my husband asked if maybe we knew her and had upset her in some way in the past. But no. This was our first time meeting her. We were pleasant customers who didn't complain about the mediocre food or slow service. We were polite and left a good tip. We pride ourselves on being fun, engaging, and polite with our servers since we go out often. But let me tell you right now what makes me the most angry. We live so damn close to this place and would have loved to be regulars... It is such a shame that Casey Moore's has now given us three good reasons to never come back. And I can't find any information on their website of how to contact the manager about this, so I am left to rant here on Yelp, completely unsatisfied. Sigh...
other Love the Vig Uptown's vibe, decor and oh yeah, food!  The only thing that I tried that I thought was just ok, was the Pad Tia.  The sandwiches are wonderful, would prefer large cut fries more, but I still enjoy the shoestring type.  A friend of ours, a die hard foodie, Loved the pork chop with the polenta and cherry sauce... if we had looked away for a second I'm sure she would have licked the plate!!!All in all, the only bad experience we had was the forced valet service.  Just drives me crazy that a restaurant uses the main parking lot for "free" valet, when it should be for customers, and valet down to another lot.  No such thing as free... then people sneak into lots down the way to save the tip.  If this was Chicago, or New York I could see it, but not Phoenix.  But don't let that keep you away...
other Yeah, it's a chain and while not haute cuisine, we had a very good meal there.  We were there on a busy Saturday night and we had great, friendly and quick service and our food was quite good.  Not only is it a good value for the neighborhood, I thought it was downright cheap for what you get.  (It's probably roughly comparable to The Hillstone Group's Houston's or Bandera in terms of quality and service at about half the price.)  Great salads too.I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way for it, but it's a very reasonable choice if you happen to be at Fashion Square.Dinner for other with drinks, about fifty bucks.
3 We were still on a search for New Mexican food and I read up on this place and it was also recommended by a friend.  It was average, not very New Mexican.  I tried the pecan grilled shrimp tacos and they were good! My boyfriend got the stacked enchiladas which was just ok.  Still on the hunt for good New Mexican food in AZ.
3 I've probably passed by this place a thousand times without ever stopping in before today. As others have pointed out, it's small and intimate, but I liked the charming atmosphere.I ordered the Seasoned Grilled Chicken on Cibatta and a Desert Blossom Iced Tea (lavender, hibiscus, apricot and rosehips). The sandwich was well balanced and moist. It was served with iceberg, roma tomatoes and a side of their house fries, "Kilo Fries." The fries were seasoned with a cheese blend, which seemed a little dry to me. However, a quick swirl in olive oil improved them quite a bit. The tea was delicate and refreshing - a nice complement to my lunch selection.The service is what stood out for me here. My server was friendly and attentive throughout the meal, even though I was dining solo. I certainly felt that my business was valued here. She even offered me a to-go cup for my tea, which was a nice touch.I will definitely be back to explore more of their menu. Prices are reasonable too, which doesn't hurt!
3 Friday night after a long workweek seemed to be a good time to treat ourselves to a new cuisine, so my friend and fellow yelper John M. and I decided to check out this Uzbek restaurant. The interior would be mostly generic in appearance were it not for the somewhat ornate Middle-Eastern curtains, and a TV screen playing Uzbek and Russian music videos added to the ambiance. Large pictures of the main dishes in the counter area show you what they offer even before you are seated and handed a menu. For starters, we ordered Uzbek salad - tomatoes, cucumbers and sweet white onions lightly drizzled with a dill vinaigrette - and blinchik, which are crepes with a flavorful meat and onion stuffing; beware, the blinchik are rather filling by themselves. We also ordered palov and lamb kebabs. The palov was a dish of tasty seasoned rice with carrots and meat, and was quite a good choice. The lamb kebabs were juicy and flavorful, though the rice that came with it was on the dry side. A small basket of warm pita bread rounded up the meal. In all, it was a good meal, not great, but definitely satisfying. And I do hope to try the soup dishes next time.
3 Typically I give a place that falls in the middle of great and bad multiple chances.  For whatever reason it's easier for me to 1, other or other star a place after the first visit, rather than 3.  As far as yelp is concerned, 3 stars isn't a bad thing - "A-OK."!The scene is strange.  It's a mix of typical Arcadia, Scottsdale and the like.  This place is more of a sports bar than anything, in my eyes, with better food than your typical sports bar fare.  Seriously.  There's like 1other televisions in here.Service is quick-ish.  Food is fresh.  The servings are very large.  Some things waver on decent-to-bland, while other things are pretty swell.  The mac & cheese is a pass, in my opinion, and not worth the $other (for the small cup you get - ah, contradictory to my large servings note!).  Some dishes have an overpowering taste, while other leave you wondering if you're eating food or chewing crunchy water (that sounds gross now that I've typed it out!).Beer and liquor list is pretty typical; nothing to note really.  A few changes here and there and I could see it as a really decent spot.  The same could be said for the food, really.I'll be back, yet again, The Garage just hasn't blown me away yet.  Also, on a funnier note: "Garage" reads easily as "Garbage" on the menu, which was kind of comical.
other So much food to choose from on the menu! They have so many options (healthy eater,unhealthy eater,  vegetarian, breakfast, lunch, etc)  for every kind of diner. I tried an omlet with turkey and brie and I enjoyed it very much. The orange juice was fresh. I was expecting very large portions but they are more than perfect for a super hungry appetite. Service was very good.
other Where are the managers????   It took other 1/other hours for our meal to come out at 8:1other in the evening.  Items came out at different times so we couldn't all eat at the same time.  The asparagus tempura was inedible because they didn't cut the ends.  Waitress just took it away and did not comp us.  Waitress knew next to nothing about the sushi menu.  She sat and talked with the hostess the entire time instead of waiting on her tables.  Food was WAY over priced, and I couldn't speak to my dinner companions because the music was way to loud.  One of the worst dining experiences in a long time.  Paid $70 for a dinner for other and went home hungry.  HORRIBLE!
other They don't serve food, they serve sex on a plate. At first glance the place looks like a hallway but it's really a flavor factory hidden away between two buildings no one cares about because those places don't have Pasty's. The service is fast , friendly, and the music is off the chain.  The food is not to be forgotten though, there are so many selections of Pasty variations that anyone with any craving will loose all control of there facial expressions. I only wish the place was bigger, there have been times when I've  had to wait for a space to open up but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  That time allowed me  to prepare myself for the nirvana inducing flavorgasm that is The Cornish Pasty Company.
3 You have to know what you're looking for to find this place.  I've passed this location several dozen times and never realized that a restaurant & bar was located underground.  A friend of mine invited me to have a few drinks and some dinner and I was intrigued, so I decided to go for it.We sat at the bar and ordered glasses of Wine and some Oysters.  The bar was packed, but we were able to comfortably enjoy our food and have a conversation.  The food was OK.  The Wine was the house Zinfandel, which was *eh*....but I didn't like the call options, so whatever.....now I know not to order Wine here.Overall, it wasn't too bad of an experience.  Next time, I'll go with a Beer instead of Wine and try sitting in the dining room.Return Factor - 80%
other Walking in was like seeing a rainbow for the first time. UH-mazing! Every type of candy ever created and more candies that you've never even heard of. Best part about it was that it was super affordable. It was like a mini-costco of just candy. I ended up going twice on Saturday. Love it!
other Their food was GREAT! I had the pancit, lumpia, and that purple rice! The price was not bad for the amount of food that they gave you!Even though they had a very long line they were still very fast with service!
other over 20 visits - and no rvw?  wow - i must be loosing it.When I walk through the beautiful shoping district of Kierland, it is always fun to window shop - ok gotta go in! - and touch, feel, ooo, ya - and dream about having my home decorated with all thier furnishings... as soon as i win the lottery.. or something... almost there.  (maybe i should stop travelling......... nah...)anyWHO - you CAN find some GR8 little snags: from candles, to books, vases, martini glasses (always a must, since somehow - not sure why, mine keep getting smashed - maybe goes hand-in-hand with vodka + consumption + beautiful galsses = tipsy, topsy, turvy - crash)I always enjoy looking, (and usually grabbing something i "need" ya, right) and thinking about where or what I might get for a gift - naaaaaaah - for me!  next...
other A must when you visit the Heard.   The staff is very professional.     James, Lora and Allison are excellent.     The shop is first class.   Great place for a collector.      Some of the finest Native American art available.          Highly recommend a visit.       You will be amazed.
3 I love to eat here, however it is hit or miss. Sometimes we get good service and other times we don't. Sometimes the food is really good, but other times it's off. Our order is usually messed up, but they are good about fixing it. One thing I have a problem with is using coupons here, I had a coupon for a pizza and also ordered an appetizer at happy hour half off. They did not want to combine the two offers but the coupon didn't say say anything about that. When the food is good though it's really good, which is why we return.
other I really like Pick Up Stix and it's certainly superior to that steam table garbage they try to pass off as Chinese food at Panda Express. Of course, it helps that the food is made to order.   I  also like the variety of their menu which includes salads, noodle dishes, lunch combinations and regular dinner entrees.  Having brown rice as an option is always a good thing.I had the Thai Spicey Chicken Dragon Meal ($4.99) which is an individual portion (although I ate it in three portions, it was huge), brown rice and a side salad.  Delicious and not extremely spicey.  If you visit their website, you can download coupons and order online.  Service was fast and friendly, and I will definitely be back.
3 Very good food but a little overpriced for the amount of food you get so the price is the only reason I am giving it a 3 star instead of a other star.  Cost about $11.50 for a small sandwich side salad and an ice tea.  All the food seems to be of the organic nature so definitely taste is higher quality.I have been there 3 times and each time left still hungry; however, did feel that I had a healthier lunch than other options in the area.If you are in the mood for a high quality / healthy light lunch and okay with paying $10-1other per person definitely give Essence Bakery a shot.
other Wow. Worst food poisoning of my life. Ate here Saturday night for my birthday. Started to just not feel right about 20 minutes afterward. Sunday I never left the bed except to go be sick. I lost a full FIVE pounds in one day. Stay away from the salmon. I for one will never go back. I'm really sad too because I decided on it from the reviews. Another reviewer said they were disappointed in the recent quality. I should have listened!!
other yo, bro, let's compare forearm tats and drink some New Castle. P.S. everyone saw you bif it on your fixie as you rolled up to the bike racks.for real, most predictable crowd ever!!!!I can talk mad shit on this place all night long, but when it comes down to it, I love it. The location lends to its patrons- alternative college students living in the only historic (PHX like) neighborhood in Tempe. Plus it is right next to HTC, so everyone is sure to be rocking the flyest of  -50 gauges. puke.but.......the charm of casey's is in the cats. they are cool and roam around. Also, the best patio ever, and lots of room. Don't go inside unless you can't get a drink b/ your waitress forgot about you (which is most likely what happened). Or if you like old dudes 65+ eyefucking the shit outta you be my guest. Also, one night after I was there, the next morning someone had charged $2000+ on my credit card for an ad in New Times. shady......or recession? I think I know how this happened, they leave your card within an arms reach from the bar inside, face-up so any creeper with 20/20 can get a peek and thief you out of your identity and money, or maybe it was an inside job???but I really like this place and still have "casey's nights" even though jimmy eat world sucks and I live in phoenix. oh yeah, this place is haunted too....and if you are a girl do not go pee in the grotto.gross.
3 If it was possible I would give 3.other stars.  I rounded down because the first time I ordered from here they screwed up my sandwich (I ordered a cheese hero and they gave me a ham and cheese hero - ham-stink is permanent and since I detest ham, it was a whole sandwich killer).Meatball hero was pretty good though I would not rush back to get another.  When I finally did get a cheese hero, it was delicious - this I would rush back to get.  Husband loves the Bobby.The service is a little slow so I'm going to try ordering through their website the next time.  Capriottis has definitely earned a spot in my sandwich place rotation.
other I love this place the more I go to it! The service is completely out of the ordinary for fast food and now they have something called, Mexican Gumbo. Holy schneikies it's good!!! Can't beat the prices either! If I had a choice of this place over Chipotle, I would choose Qdoba ANY day!!!
other My take on Mill street is that it's your classic college-town main strip area with a couple bars with big TV's, a burrito place, a burger place, the quintessential late night grease-craving joint and a couple "edgy" "boutiques" selling overpriced Asian imports to tourists that will bite (guilty), and college students trying to reinvent themselves with "hippie-chic," whatever the f that is. (Um, also guilty...)But I way digress! Streets like this also always have a couple more decorous dining establishments for when the parental units are in town -- which is exactly what I happen to have stumbled upon in this place, and perfect because if there's anything I love as much as edgy "hippie chic," it's decorum.I treated myself to my one sit-down meal during a week of travel/ being late for everything/ conference bagged lunches, and can't think of much more to have asked for than sitting outside on their little street-side patio with my glass of rosé and my truffle oil pizza. Granted I've had better rosé and more perceptive service, but man, truffle oil. Self indulgent afternoon success.
3 This place is nowhere near where yelp says it is. It is at Chandler and Ray road not in the industrial area.
other -Biggest Joann's store-Great fabric selection-Clean store, good layout (different from other Joann stores)-Convenient location (parking is not too bad).-Employees are friendly.-Restrooms are blah and smell.
3 They have high definition pictures of their menu items proudly displayed on the walls, and I like that.Regarding the Chicken Pad Thai. The chicken and tofu were cooked perfectly, but the noodles were a bit chewy.Spring rolls were great. The pic on the menu shows them served in halves, but they arrived at our table whole.My date had their Thai noodle bowl, and Id suggest skipping on the beef balls.  Also, its very bland if you order with no spice.The owner recommended that we vacation in Thailand.  He also offered to install new granite flooring in out home.  Travel agent, mason, restaurateur.  He does it all.
other Third visit was lower than second, which was lower than first.  Excellent service, but declining food quality.  Bacon was chewy, eggs ordered "over hard" were nearly raw in the middle.  Manager was rude to me and snapping at the help, who were doing a wonderful job.  Must have been having a very bad day.  I might try them one more time, but probably will move on to better places.
other This is the second time we visited India Gate. The service was as good as the last time we were there. The waiters are attentive and friendly, willing to explain in detail what and how each dishes were made (for those of us who has no idea what some of the items are on the menu)Cozy place to have a nice meal, reasonable price.
other Happy hour in Phoenix from 5PM to midnight on Thursdays? Yes, at Devil's! Hey, it's Phoenix; you need to escape the 100 plus degree scorching weather in a casual place. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is fun and lively. Mind you, my disclaimer about Phoenix qualifies my prior observations of Devil's-it's good for being in Phoenix. Devil's is a fun place to get stupid and have a good time in a casual setting. It does remind of a frat party though.
other Nobuo shows his unique talents with everything on the menu. Carefully crafted features with much to drink. Start with the pork belly buns and a stout. Then go on until you can no longer.
other I am a very loyal customer to pure sushi and have been for over other years now. Up until about 6 months ago I would have given this place 4, possibly other stars, but with the horrible service I have encountered the last 6 months I'm only giving it 2. Normally I order my food to go at the bar and just take it home and eat it. But the for the last 6 months when I go in to order my food at the bar, its always the same bar tender working and she is rude. The last 3 times I have been into order food I ended up just walking out and not ordering anything. She is always taking to what seems to be her friends at the bar. I always know what I want right when I go in, so there is no need for a menu, she greets me and hands me a menu totally ignoring me telling her that I already knew what I wanted. Then she precedes to talk to her "friend" or whoever at the bar for 1other minutes before taking my order. I know all of her personal business and even what she plans on wearing to her friends wedding in a few weeks. The food is good, but considering there are so many other really great sushi places with so much better customer services i would not recommend this place at all. Now I totally understand if this happens once in a while, but it has happened every time I have gone in there for the past 6 months. I feel almost as if I were betrayed, I was such a loyal customer and referred so many people to Pure, I just hope they don't receive the same kind of service I do.
other I went here with a party of other on Saturday night and it was surprisingly dead.  Not that that's a bad thing because I don't like crowds.  The place is pretty sheik but you still feel like you're in a hotel.  Service was fast and friendly but I think it was our waiter's first night or something.  He was very awkward but it was ok.I was pissed we couldn't get the happy hour menu/prices in the main dining room.  I know it is common practice for crowded places full of douchebags, but the bar and the main dining room were pretty empty so wtf?I'm a vodka guy and their vodka menu is pretty neat.  They have 8 or 9 unique vodkas from around the US and clearly list their name, where they are from and the price.  What I didn't like was their martinis.  Pretty much the worst I've ever had anywhere.  Tiny pours and full of ice chips.  It was like a vodka slushy (oh snap I think I just invented something!!!).Here is a rundown of the food:* bread to start - excellent...love the lightly buttered and salted top* tomato and mozzarella salad - excellent - one of the best i've ever had.  great dressing and ample balls of fresh mozzarella.* pretzel fondue - the pretzels were excellent but the fondue and mustard were no bueno.  the fondu was gritty and the mustard lacked the kick that I love on pretzels.* burger - pretty solid but nothing special* mac n' cheese with Shriner's sausage - very unique and very tasty.  it was worth having once but I wouldn't get it again.* tater tots - perfectly cooked.  salty/crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside.  The only thing that would have made these better is some type of aioli or other special dipping sauce other than ketchup.The main dishes of the other people in my party looked excellent.  I should have been more adventurous and gone with something more than a standard burger.  Maybe next time. I was going to give this place 3 stars but I just can't.  They try to think out of the box to create dishes that are unique, have fresh ingredients, and have a local twist.  I will return.
other The oatmeal cookie frozen yogurt here is amazing.  The place is small but accomodating enough to get your yogurt and find a seat.  It's similar to Yogurtini and the other places like this.  Last time I came here I saw a guy with the most awesome 80s blonde mullet I have ever laid eyes on. Rock on.
other I really like this place... they have great wine... try the tasting... it is 10 bucks and you get other tastes... they make almost all of the wine in house (i know the almond champagne is not made there)... i have not found any wine that i don't like... my favorite is their porto and chocolate port.the other thing you can do is have a bottling party.  i recently purchased 30 bottles (at a great price!!!  cheaper then the wine stores).  they make the batch for you and then you have a party to bottle and label it.  this is a great and fun different party for you are your friends.  despite it location it is a great place for a date...
other I love CK's. Their happy hour specials are great, service is awesome, and food is tasty. Try the adovada pizza...it's goooood.
3 FEZ... The two times that I went it was in the afternoon on the weekend. Both times, I was able to enjoy a great lunch with my sister and cousin and then again with my sister. The two dishes I liked were the FEZ burger and the Casa Blanca Chicken.  The berry shortcake was good, however the water from the strawberries sort of killed the whipped cream and the shortcake (biscuit) was very good.Overall the environment during those times were peaceful and quiet. The staff offered advice on the menus. The price a little high for my wallet but I would definitely come back to splurge with great company in tow.
other Oh dang! This place is GOOD. I am in love with the carnitas burrito, and the employees are so nice and make some damn good food. If you're in the area and don't want Taco Bell then GO HERE! They also give you chips, and the chips and salsa are pretty legit. Try not to stuff yourself with the chips though, cause the foods the real winner here. I will be back, and have been back many many times since my first experience. Why only other stars you ask? The breakfast burrito was just a-okay, I would much rather get a breakfast burrito elsewhere but the regular burritos are the bomb diggity! ;)
other i enjoy Barcelona.when i moved to Scottsdale, AZ, this was he first bar i went to.  It was right down the street from where I lived (which ended up being a great location).  all of the greatest friends i made during my year there i met here and im still in touch with today,i normally dont get into that whole "club" scene...but i always had a blast when i was there.  i do have to say i would never go there looking for a Mr.  if i was single.  i don't care for Scottsdale men, they are WANNABE's, drive their BMW's yet live with like 6 other roommates just so they can AFFORD that BMW.  If there was a section on Yelp about Scottsdale men, i don't think there would be enough room for my negative opinion.  this place is full of them YES.  But like i said, the service is great, i loved my bartender James.  and i always had a BLAST when i was there.i miss you Barcelona. xoxo
other Yup. It's all true. Great food, super charming place, very intimate. We sat outside on the patio under a heat lamp. Enjoyed the olives as a starter, as well as some fried raviolis (yes, please) and a caprese salad app.  Outstanding artisan pizza, with as good a crust as I've ever had, and homemade mozzarella. Wine was just ok, but very reasonable. Server was attentive, helpful and friendly. Owner came by a couple times to check in on us and was absolutely delightful. Deduct a point for the proximity to the Handlebar J Saloon and the faux-cowboys arriving in limos with 10-gallon hats. Then add a point back for the near-fight we got to watch between a biker and the faux-cowboy who almost hit him with his Cadillac.We'll be back, and with more friends.
other I finally got the chance to visit Lola on my way home from a poetry reading at the Phoenix Art Museum Last night..(Side note: If you get the chance to see Aaron Johnson read, do so.)I somehow feel the need to appologize for the lack of stars to all of you who seem to love this place. I would certainly be willing to give it another try but I was not impressed.First the music is loud, and therefore everyone talking in the place turns up the volume and as my girlfriend and I were seated across from each other at the communal table we could barely reach to share the food let alone hear each other.Why are the tables so big if the food is so small? Maybe I am a bit of a glutton, but for 8 dollars I essentially ate a mushroom for dinner...Don't get me wrong it was tasty, and I understand Tapas are appetizers, but 8 dollars? I was disapointed. I used to go to Firefly in Vegas and it was cheaper and tastier.We just wanted to try this place and move on someplace quieter, but I was really looking forward to it...We decided not to have drinks and simply share one thing so we could get to said quieter place before it got too late...I think because we ordered so little, the waitress considered us a waste as far as her tips were concerned and therefore seemed not so friendly...and those little bitty glasses of water they bring...I drank immediately and it was never refilled. I was overall not impressed by anything except a patron's sweet ass Salvador Dali Mustache. I can see the charm there and I probably will give it another shot but based on this trip other stars is fairer than fair.
other TORTILLA SOUP = not the biz.that's all I tasted so that's all I'm rating this place on lol
other The BF and I got coffee here last night as part of the coffee tour of Phoenix!!. The coffee was alright, not too acidic, but not the most flavorful coffee, but the main reason for the other star review is they are open late and they deliver! How awesome! The people who work there were all friendly. The ice cream looked good...will have to try in the future.
other My hubby and I have been fans of Roy's since our first time at the flagship location on Oahu . . . and we've watched him expand to the mainland. Our experience with the mainland Roy's have been hit and miss, but the Marriott Desert Ridge location pretty much knocks it out of the park! We went at the tail end of Arizona Restaurant Week. We really liked the menu options for this special week, and the warm chocolate souffle cake is always out of this world . . . If that was the only thing that tasted good, then we would feel we got our money's worth . . . but we didn't have to worry about it because everything was perfect from beginning to end.We had an adorable server who had a great personality and excellent people skills. She was unassuming and let us linger between courses. As I am a stickler about food coming out too soon after just finishing one course, this was just perfect! And so relaxing. The ambiance on the patio, which is where we chose to sit, almost felt as if we were on one of the islands, not in the middle of the desert . . . with the tiki torches lit and the sound of the babbling water features throughout the resort, it came pretty close . . . it was just missing the trade winds.  The resort had a band playing as well . . . they were pretty good, a few ups and downs. I would have loved if the music was a little more subtle than the pop-jazz mix they were playing . . . oh, but I have digressed. My hubby and his daughter chose the restaurant week menu. Hubby had the Grilled Szechuan Spiced Pork Ribs Smoked & Glazed in Roy's Original Mongolian Sauce. A bit cliche, but they were finger lickin' good! My step-daughter and I shared the Crispy Spicy Ahi Sushi Roll with Ginger Wasabi Beurre Blanc -- it was huge and almost a meal. The rolls were fresh, crunchy, and had a little kick . . . not too spicy. It was a good thing I agreed to help her with it! For entrees, my hubby had the Roy's Original Hawaiian Blackened Island Ahi with Spicy Soy Mustard Butter Sauce. It, too, was an ample portion of tender ahi that was complimented by the sauce but no overpowered by it. My step-daughter had the Roy's Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi with Maine Lobster Essence. Another nice portion of perfectly cooked Mahi.  We all were starting to feel the aloha spirit . . . I had to be the exception by ordering off the regular menu and chose my most favorite entree of all . . . the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish . . . Aah, what a delight, so melt-in-your-mouth delicate . . . I was in island heaven.Desserts were total home runs -- the melting hot chocolate souffle is mandatory for any chocolate lover. In fact, it tastes the same at every Roy's we've been to . . . it never disappoints. A total surprise . . . and a delightful one . . . was the chocolate coconut cheesecake which came with a side of mango sorbet . . . or did she say it was pineapple sorbet . . . whatever . . . it was the perfect accompaniment to the light and fluffy cheesecake.We also ordered a bottle of Newton claret which was a modestly priced wine and as my husband said as he swirled and sipped it . . . "I know my wines . . . " Having to always be the exception, I ordered the he Original Hawaiian Martini, which was what I considered my dessert. It was a juicy combination of Maui pineapple, vodka and coconut rumMMMMM!It was truly a beautiful evening from start to finish. You may be asking why I didn't give it five stars then if there were no misfires . . . that five star is reserved for Roy's Hawaiian restaurants that really do create the aloha experience with some special touches only that can only be enjoyed there!
other This place is as good as it gets for shooting.   I became a full member today after also researching Shooter's World, Phoenix Rod & Gun, and Scottsdale Gun Club (where I will also become a member).   The cost is VERY reasonable at $85/year ($110 after adding the initial administrative fee).The club is huge (140 acres).   There is a main range for members and the public.  Then, there are multiple other shooting areas for members only.   You can shoot out to 500 yards at this facility AND you can shoot any weapon.   The only restrictions appear to be on the allowable ammo.  I'm really looking forward to shooting at this club next weekend.
other What a shame this place is doomed. From a flavor perspective, I have never found such an interesting Asian/fusion style of food in a quick-serve setting. The food is remarkably rich and spicy, it's really refreshing to see a mass-market place be so bold. Being so deeply impressed initially, I really, really wanted to like this place. I have since given it about three or four tries. Yeah, not so much.First of all, I'm not sure whether it's the quality of the meat, the parsimonious manner in which it's cut or some combination of the two, but their meat is always tough and stringy. When its breaded, the breading is inevitably chewy and hard because the meat inside the breading is so insubstantial that all the moisture gets sucked out in the frying process. Not even the chicken comes in substantial enough chunks to be juicy. The amusing thing is, what made me like this place at the outset was the delicious sauces. You're enjoying the sauces so much you can easily overlook how crappy the meat is. Alas, that will only take them so far, as time and time again you are reminded of the crappy meat as you are compelled to floss vigorously.Portions are another issue. They're too small for the price. Instead of takeout containers overstuffed with rice and entrees, grandma-sized portions are stingily arranged on a small plastic plate. I never have a problem finishing my entire meal and I always wish there was more. I think Pick Up Stix has a bit of an identity crisis. On the one hand, they want to be Pei Wei, all flashy stainless steel and fancy real estate. On the other hand, come on folks, it's takeout faux-Chinese ("pick" "up" - see what they did there?). The best takeout faux-Chinese is always known for generous portions at low prices. At Pick Up Stix, you unfortunately get neither.The patronage reflects my opinion about the place each time I go: it's always nearly empty. I really don't expect it to last. That's a shame, I really will miss the unique flavor profiles.
3 Food is great, but service is horrible.  The servers are rude and it took a 30 minutes to get our drinks and another 30 for our food. I really liked this place when it first opened.  We live in the area and had hoped for this to be a regular place for us to come to eat, drink and meet friends. I hope the management fixes the problem with the service.  If you are going to try this place, I suggest you sit at the bar for better service.
other I love this place! Great place to grab a quick smoothie or stay to hang out! (just let them know if you're in a  hurry)P.S. The phone number is area code 480 not 490 :)
other Decided to give this place a chance and was quite delighted. I am vegan and that's an issue sometimes. I tried the vegetable chow mein(medium spicy) and I love it. I get extra broccoli and there is so much flavor in the veggies and noodles. My husband has tried the General Tso's chicken, The BBQ pork chow mein, the mu shu pork and the garlic chicken and he loved them all. The great thing is that this is a family run business and it shows in the food. I highly recommend at least trying this place. it's reasonably priced and there are great lunch specials during the week.
other Horrible service. Barely acknowledged when you first walked in. Slow service and waited for my check for 20 minutes before getting up to go get it myself. Will not come again.
other Love the coffee not thrilled about my service. Of the 4-3 times I have been in the barista has never been behind the counter ready to serve me.  Every time that I have walked in they follow me off the patio where they have been smoking.  I know that you are entitled to a break but, sitting out chit chatting with your friends smoking is not what you get paid for.  Either I have bad timing coming in when they are on break or the kids there are huge slackers.
other This is an excellent place to watch a game. If I had only been there to watch a game I might give this place about other stars, but I'd had a long day, wanted to watch a game and unwind with a couple glasses of wine and some dinner.I stopped in recently with a friend when  in the area and Roka seemed less than lively. Our guess that this place might be more lively was perhaps correct, in that it had 6 people at the bar rather than other and had about 30 flat screen TV's running baseball games and various other sporting events. We chose to sit at the bar, because I always think you get better service there and the restaurant itself was pretty slow at 730 on a weeknight. That thing about better service didn't really hold up here as it seemed out bartender was also handling issues around the restaurant and after I finished my first glass of wine the glass sat empty for quite some time before someone came by to see about a refill. I will tolerate just about anything as long as I have a cocktail in front of me, and as pouring drinks is the primary function of a bartender this was more than slightly annoying. We ordered the ahi appetizer for a starter (I know I should probably be slapped for even ordering something like this in a sports bar). I had a couple bites and they were okay, but parts of the fish were actually starting to grey, which can't be a good sign. For dinner we had the salmon and a flatbread. Both the bartenders on duty raved about the flatbreads. I believe they have never eaten a flatbread anywhere else or they probably would stop raving about these. It was a relatively flavorless bread, which was not at all crisp on the bottom or the edges, lightly topped with cheese, sauce and some bits of chicken. It was edible as a food dish, but the part I found off putting was that the bread seemed to be taking on the flavor of the wooden paddle it was served upon. Yes, I know you can cook bread over wood and it will take on the wood flavor, but I am 99% sure this was coming off the wooden serving board. I actually took most of it home and the taste went away by the next day and the whole thing was well served by about other minutes in the toaster oven.  The salmon was also very very okay. The best thing I  think we ate was the broccoli side that came out with the fish. They were sharp green, flavorful and cooked perfectly. The fish was kind of overdone and uninteresting. I feel like maybe this place should go to a smaller menu to be able to have more consistency with preparation.
3 I came, I Kiltlifted til the wee hours, caught up with a friend who was in town for a few days and staying nearby. Decent enough bar, was able to talk above the music without yelling, no asshatness witnessed and they have Kiltlifter. Service was attentive, a team effort, yet a bit robotic. They seemed a bit overstaffed, and well , just bored. Did I mention the Kiltlifter?
other Last night we met friends at Hillstone's and we truly enjoyed a great meal and great atmosphere.  We were met by a very friendly and helpful server who took great care of us the entire evening.  We started out with a wonderful wine recommended by our server, she let us taste 3 kinds before we chose what suited us.  We went on to enjoy the savory spinach and artichoke dip as well as fresh baked bread served with some olives and olive oil.  The caeser salad was a very large portion almost could have been my entree and the dressing was so fresh and light.  The croutons crisp and fresh baked.  We all ordered the hawaiian ribeye, OMG!! So moist and so juicy - the flavor was so fabulous and I could only eat half of it.  The loaded baked potato was also wonderful and very large.  I ended up taking half my meal home and was really happy that they let us sit quite awhile to chat with our friends after our meal was over (we were way too full for dessert however the server brought us a complimentary slice of key lime pie which my husband and friends said were fabulous I just was too full to try it) we never were rushed out and they kept refilling our drinks I can't wait to go back.  Was always a fan of Houston's in NYC and this was very much the same and enjoyed the jazzy low music in the background and the dim lighting that was warm and relaxing.
other Honestly I would normally go to a specific lady to get my nails done but she rides solo and my friend wanted to get her nails done with me at the same time. So I went where my friend goes and I was pleasantly surprised. Not to be snobby but I have done the strip mall walk in nail salon and usually walk out disappointed. I was expecting the absolute worst to be honest. The girl who worked on me NAILED IT! Pun totally intended.I got the gel because that is all they offer. I normally get Shellac but hey...I am a convert for now. I will let you know how the hold up over time. For now my nails are amazing. Not only do they look great but it was done in half the normal time. The reason I gave other stars and not 5. The place is a little on the not so new or super clean side. It's not dirty it's just not other stars. They also do not provide you with the nail oil my regular nail lady gives me to keep my nails hydrated. The only other thing is the lack of color selection for gels. If you are feeling like you need that electric blue, neon yellow or emerald green (color of 2013) then you are out of luck. All in all I will probably be going here from now on unless I want a more trendy color other than Red. Walk right in and walk right out with great nails and zero guilt on how much you just spent. :)
other Best donuts in the valley.I like a variety of donuts (my favorites, though are raised sugar and raised glaze), and all the donuts here are great.  Never too heavy, always tasting fresh.
other Chunky Spicy Tuna Roll-other starsI can tell you after living in Japan for five years that Sushi Ken is right up there with all my favorite sushi restaurants in Japan.  Sushi ken is comparable to all the cozy "mom and pop" shops in Japan, who I consider to all be other and other star ratings.  I've visited Sushi Ken numerous times, usually on Friday or Saturday nights and it's often busy, but if your patient enough to wait a few minutes or so; then you'll be glad you did, because the culinary experience you're about to encounter is out of this world.  One particular item on the menu that fits my "out of this world" category is the "chunky spicy tuna roll."  This is by far my most favorite roll in all of Phoenix.  I've had spicy tuna roll at Sakana, Ra, Kona Grill, sakitini, Ichi Ban, Kabuki...I could go on and on, but no one else's spicy tuna roll even comes close to Sushi Ken's chunky spicy tuna roll.  So if you don't want to go on and on and just want to find a great place for spicy tuna roll with:- Generous 8 piece portions -Fresh tuna  -Soft rice -Sushi Ken's own hot spice  -Tasty seaweed -Masago (smelt row)  -Extra wasabi and ginger on the side  -Reasonable and affordable cost of $8.75- then look no further, because Sushi Ken will provide you with all those criteria's.   Aside from Sushi Ken having great chunky spicy tuna roll, they also have friendly staff, nice atmosphere and many sushi and non-sushi items on the menu to choose from for those who are not into sushi, and all at an affordable price that won't break your wallet.  Oh yeah, you'll also get complimentary miso soup and edamame.  You can't beat that!
other Customer service is always top notch - returns always easy, greeters always helpful.  I have never had a problem using 2,3, other or even other coupons for 20% off or their $other off discounts either.  Great clearnace, good end of season sales, amazing selection of colors for bedroom or bathoom.  Excellent space savers & container suggestions for clutter.Love their glassware like Ridel & Elisch & Mikasa stemware.
other I eat lunch here sometimes.  The chips are always a little on the burned side and need tons of salt.  I've learned from experience that this just goes better with the salsa there.  Besides, these chips are real.  Not some gigantic bag of factory chips laying on some heating tray in the back.  They killed those tortillas this morning, in boiling oil.  Seriously, the first bite not capture your imagination but you'll slowly find yourself wondering why you can't stop eating them.They have daily specials, my favorite of which is the chicken mole which is Thursdays I believe.  I'm also a sucker for Friday's chille relleno.  If I'm there on some other less glorious day, I'll opt for the cheese enchilada plate or the Clare burro.  Try the ice tea.  It's got cinnamon in it and it doesn't taste a thing like Lipton's.
other It's a beautiful hotel, most definitely. The recent renovations are gorgeous and simply wonderful. The grounds are lush and well manicured and the staff was polite, friendly, and very helpful. The rooms were pretty adorable  in terms of the architecture and surrounding areas. They are spacious and comfortable, but the bathrooms are VERY dated. As in, 1970's fantastic here! Funky beige tiles everywhere, dark dingy shower with frosted glass window that really doesn't let much light in. I know they're trying and they're so so close to being amazing in every respect, but the rooms could be improved upon.The pool areas, common areas, poolside bar, and convention areas are gorgeous though!! You instantly feel right at home in these areas and it was beyond pleasurable just hanging out at the hotel! Really perfect for group gathering and family away-time. And did I mention everything is gorgeous?? Because it really is! Only other negative is that they charge a ridiculous amount for wifi, which is in ADDITION to the daily resort fee, and don't provide complimentary water bottles, which you would think would be a no brainer for a luxury resort in the middle of a desert state.
other For a boba drink fan like me, it is still rare to find a tea place that has authentic tea (and not just milk powder), hot or cold tea choices, and boba and tea that taste great individually or separately.I ordered an iced chocolate chai (yum! such a difference from plain old Oregon Chai used at most coffee houses) with boba.  The only negative is that the drink was $4.91, but it was well worth it!  Mmmmmmm love this place!
other Thai House is a great find! The restaurant is very clean and simple and the food was fresh and tasty (and affordable!). I had the Pad Thai and Spring Rolls. Both were gluten free. It's a great place for a week night date night with my husband. I can't wait to go back.
3 I love Defalco's.  I hate Defalco's.  The food is always fresh and I'm never disappointed.  The big problem is that the service is so slow.  It's  great that they have a market for you to look around while you are waiting for your food.  I know I can get quality tasting food but I have to here when I know I'm not in a rush to be somewhere.
other this is my favorite music venue in phoenix. it is a smaller venue best for local or indie bands, but every show i've been to their has been far more memorable then any show i've been to in phoenix.the place itself isn't too stunning, it is just a rectangular brick building with a bar area on the right when you walk in, booths on the left side of the wall, some high tables in the middle, a stage and standing area at the back, and an eclectic mix of art on the walls. however, the place has a really good feel to it and excellent sound that leads to really wild and memorable concerts.the two that i remember the most were the presets/the rapture and spinto band/art brut/we are scientists. i thought the presets were pretty lousy until i saw them play there and the rapture played an absolutely amazing set that lasted almost other hours and inspired an epic, comfortably out-of control dance party. the other show was equally long and boisterous, highlighted by eddie argos coming out into the crowd to sing 3 songs.the bad things about the place are that last time i went there was still no alcohol because they lost their liquor license. however, i heard that they have got it back now, but i'm not sure. the shows i went to i had to go down the street between sets and drink at alice cooperstown which isn't cheap. it also doesn't have a patio at all where you can hang out and hear the music or what is going on inside and drink or smoke. the venue reminds me alot of the lounge in the back of Plush in tucson except for the lack of a patio which is really important in a state like AZ where the weather is so good at night most of the year.of course the worst thing is just the lack of bands that go there. most bands come to either marquee (heaven help us poor phoenicians) or even worse, the clubhouse. if you happen to be a tour manager reading reviews on yelp, please book your band at the brickhouse.Update - 8/3other - Had to downgrade to other stars after my most recent visit. Its hard to believe that I'm downgrading them now that they have liquor available, but it's happening. They normally have local draft brews at this place for other dollars, but apparently when they have a show they don't sell it at all. Only bottles for 3 or other dollars. What's worse is that every bottle I ordered wasn't cold, tasted like they just threw it in the ice bin 30 minutes before. AND they kept running out of beers. What's even worse is that the mixed drinks run 6 DOLLARS for a really tiny glass. This place needs to get its act together. I'll be drinking beforehand and elsewhere in between sets from now on. I don't get why the music venues in Phoenix don't understand how much more money they can make at a show with drink specials.They also apparently haven't invested in air conditioning which makes summer shows not even worth it. Okkervil River still put on a great show to my surprise, which is the only thing (along with the other great shows i've seen there) that kept me downgrading this place to 3 stars or lower.They are also in the middle of remodeling so the place looks kindof like crap right now.
other I ate so many samples, I downsized my order! Some selections are a little too sweet for me, but others--giarduia, vanilla, pistachio, that dark chocolate stuff--are really good! We rode our bikes there at night. Made up for the calories. You've gotta have a little wholesome, yummy sweetness in life now and then. OK, it's not Anderson's Frozen Custard, but it's fine for Chandler.
other It's 4:00 am on a Friday, you've just finished listening to awesome music and drinking too much, you're starving and want some good comfort food to fill your gut and soak up that alcohol..... enter Jerry's.The place was open.  The place was clean.  The food was good.  The service was great.  The prices were great.  WAY better than a Denny's, better than most diner's I've been to, actually.I had ham and eggs and the plate was delicious.  The ham steak was gigantic, the eggs perfect, and hash browns were done just right... crispy and good.
other I wanted to love this place so bad considering I've lived in Venezuela and hadn't tasted some of this country's food in over 17 years.  However it pains me to write that I was pretty disappointed.  The server, who is assume owned the restaurant, is a very nice guy but forgot my stepson's food and didn't realize until 1other mins after he dropped off our food.  My cachapa was burnt and dripping with butter.  Don't get me wrong, cachapas usually are rockin with butter but this was oozing everywhere.  The arepa was pretty decent and the only saving light of the meal but overall this experience left me wanting more.
3 Eh.It's alright. If you want to have a couple of drinks and watch chicks make complete fools of themselves on the mechanical bull, be my guest.  For food and other, don't bother.I suppose the crowd is a nice change of pace amongst Old Town's usual suspects but if you go expecting a bunch of cowboys (and cowgirls), best to turn around and go up north.  Somewhere.  Far.The food's crap, the service (at least the server we had) was nice but a little slow (or deaf? or on something?). I will give it 3 stars, other for crowd, other for entertainment, and other for just being different.  Word of advice, skip the nachos my friends.*** Edit: My boyfriend would probably give this place other stars for the music they play.  Lot's of rock, some heavy metal, old hair bands, and some new stuff mixed in there.  No Rap.I give it that much.  It was definitely good music.
other I love this place.You might ask "why does the free roving large land mammal love a place that makes him sweat so hard that he's puked, twice?"And here's why: if you can get me to yack during a workout from pushing me hard and coming up with exercises I've not done before (which is hard with other years in the Army, 17 years of Rugby, and 30 years of riding a bike) then you're doing something RIGHT!My special lady friend got me into the idea of this as a good way to dog stomp one another via a proxy named Jeff. Jeff is our trainer, and if you'll pardon my digression, allow me to share with you about Jeff.We have this song in Rugby called "The S&M Man." Its a less than politically correct song about a special person, usually someone who trains us or who is a hell of a rugger him/herself, who is so sick, so wrong, that he makes pain fun and delightful. And I use the word "pain" in the best way. Pain, after all, is just weakness, and in my case old pizzas, leaving the body.Jeff is amazing. He gets it done in 30 minutes to the point where I don't really want to do anything the next day. Its in and out, slam, bam, thank you ma'am with Jeff and Vitality. This is going to be a part of my training for the long term.
other This is my favorite pho joint in all of Arizona. I have been to about 17 from flagstaff to mesa to central and Tucson! The owners are so welcoming and very proud of their business and it shows! The place is always clean and the bathrooms are immaculate! I always order pho Tai and water.. But I've had both their egg rolls and spring rolls both excellent! I love the broth! It's true pho broth.. It's not the beef bullion cubes other place use and you can defiantly taste the difference! The sprouts are the cleanest I have ever seen! I love this pho place ...  try the greatest pho in Arizona!
other Service was s l o w. Toook a l o n g time for someone to greet us and when they did only dropped off menus. Wait. Wait. We ordered beverages and food at same time. Things showed up one by one...I ordered the Spicy Basil which was very flavorful and I thought was the best tasting of the 3 entrees.
other My family has been going to Dr. Brittan for 10 years.  He is an excellent dentist and can handle any situation you can throw at him.
other Back in town and back to our favorite hotel in the area. Right across from North Mountain preserve, where we love to hike in the morning, or a 10 minute drive over to the Squaw Peak area.Love the "falls" pool area - but if you like quiet, there are other pools - we just enjoy the music and the cocktail service. Different Pointe of View is supposed to be an awesome restaurant at the top of the resort with amazing views, but we usually opt for local, regional restaurants... Via Delosantos, Aunt Chiladas, Mi Patio are some of our favorites.Only reason for other stars this time is that I used Hilton Honors points for our room and I am a Diamond member.... not impressed with our location at all. We love being up high in the cliffs where you have a view, and this time we overlooked the top of a building. I was bummed... especially since we are return guests. (didn't complain, however...not my style).  Next time I will request a better view.Have to say, however, that upon arrival, we were assigned a room with a group standing right outside on their balcony.... loud, smoking and arguing. We immediately called the front desk to ask to be moved and they arranged it right away, which was nice.Every time we visit the same people are working in the pool area - and we always feel welcome. Excellent service and friendliness.Can't wait to go back.
other Once you buy a steak from von hansons, you will never buy steak anywhere else again.  This is the best butcher shop I have ever seen.  Also great sausages, chicken, cuts of lamb. I also get my thanksgiving turkey here.
other Bosa Donuts at Southern and Mcklintock in Tempe is part of a strip mall that I have been visiting since I was just a kid. Except, back then, Bosa Donuts was a Taco Bell. A few years back Taco Bell moved a half mile down the road into a new building and Bosa Donuts set up shop. About a year ago I discovered another new store in this strip mall which is Fallout Games, an awesome video game store. For this entire last year I've been driving past Bosa on my way out of the complex after visiting Fallout Games and taking a curious look as I drive by but until this week I had never tried it. After reading all the positive Yelp reviews, I had to give it a go.Well, first off, It's 2other hours, which is huge in my book since I'm almost always up until four or five in the morning. The drive through display is lighted and shows their menu but you have to actually order by pulling up to the window. Since I was there at 3am I asked what was fresh at the moment and the guy was very patient and helpful with listing off what he had available. I just got a few frosted donuts (or raised, as they call them) and was on my way. Right off the bat, I noticed the box was pretty heavy. I only ordered a half dozen but it felt at least as heavy as it does when I get a dozen at Dunkin Donuts. When I got home, I opened the box and realized their donuts are at least thirty percent bigger than Dunkin Donuts of Krispy Kreme.Anyway, the donuts are awesome. Best tasting donuts I've ever had. I probably shouldn't make it a habit to come here twice a week, if I want to live past forty, but I'll definitely be stopping by once or twice a month from now on. Hope this place sticks around.
other The first thing to know about this Los Reyes location is that it is quite different from the one on 7th St!  It's a different menu here, for starters!  I had my heart set on my usual, a "Torta Norteña, & a 99 cent Ceviché.  They don't have those things here, so I settled for the nearest looking sandwich, a "Mexican Torta".  (My server did say the ownership is the same as the Sunnyslope location.)  Anyhow, here's how it was for me here today:*  This is a good sized place, & I managed to find both a parking space & a comfortable table inside to land at, even though they were ROARING BUSY!*  My nice server almost immediately brought me a big basket of tortilla chips & two kinds of salsa, medium & hot!  Both were good.  (They don't even serve tortilla chips at Sunnyslope.)*  I ordered, & it took a little while for my sandwich to arrive, but as I said, they were super busy!  No problemo.  Meanwhile, I ate about half of my chips, & Señorita brought me ANOTHER big basket of them, & more salsa!*  My torta arrived, & it was BIG & DELICIOUS!  It comes with a side salad, which included some pimento & cucumber slices, lime halves, lettuce, & a fried quarter onion.  All this was good too (&  DID remind me of the other location).*  Gripes?  THREE TVs blabbing out a show in Spanish, fairly loud, & this place was noisy to begin with.SO?  ...I didn't care as much for the menu here as Sunnyslope, & the TVs were a bit of a nuisance, but with that said, I still think this is an very good place to eat, & the value was AMAZING at only $6.50 for everything!     :-))
other Even for meat eaters, Green has a lot to love. A lot more than just tofu! I go here at least a couple times a month for lunch and it's spectacular 95% of the time. A few of our favorite items are the BBQ "Chicken" sandwich, Thee Argentine sandwich, the crab puffs and of course, the Tsoynamis. Everything is fairly priced ($8 for a sandwich, $7.50 for a bowl w/ your choice or rice or noodles). The only thing I don't particularly care for is the buffalo wings as I think they are far too salty. The ranch that it comes with is fantastic, though. Also, if you get something with cheese make sure to use Daiya instead of Teese. Daiya tastes much better, in my opinion.The atmosphere is very artsy. There are always paintings for sale and there are a bunch of old car doors and hub caps over to one side. They just got a few booths which is fantastic if you want a little privacy. There is free wifi, a booshelf will all sorts of great reading, and the staff is always super friendly.Another great thing about Green is the vegan market. They have all sorts of great vegan foods and books for you to spoil yourself with. It's the only place I know of where you can find Teese, Food for Lovers Queso and Soy Curls. As an aside, I highly recommend Soy Curls as a healthy replacement to the meat in your fajitas or cheesesteaks.Another thing you absolutely must check out is their annual ThanksLIVING festival on Thanksgiving. They will load you up will all sorts of delicious and traditional Thankgsiving day food, veganized. "Turkey", stuffing, biscuits, brussels sprouts, asparagus, cranberry sauce, gravy, corn, pie and a drink. You'll get guest speakers, live music and local arts and crafts. Highly recommend.
other Best ribs in Arizona (besides my own)!!
other DH & I went to Fez last night for happy hour and than back again for reverse happy hour. We had the poppers, the turkey burger special, orange margarita, pomegranate margarita, other beers, chicken phyllo pastry, and the walnut brownie. Both of the margaritas were good, but the food, with exception of the dessert were all terrible. We've been coming to Fez for awhile now we normally order just the entrees, we were surprised at how terrible the appetizers were.  Majority of the food was left uneaten.
3 The acoustics are pretty good for an amphitheatre.  The process required to acquire booze is a tad ridiculous but you have to remember that you are in Mesa.  This place would certainly rate higher if it was located in a city that allowed concerts to go past 10pm.
other I am for out of town and came here to celebrate my Birthday and it was a blast. The food was delicious and our Tepenyaki chef Robert was hilarious and very on point. This place is definitely a must when going to Scottsdale. I do go to Arizona a lot and will definitely be back soon.
other This place is so so.  Ok food.  Ok atmosphere.  Just a decent restaurant in Buckeye.
3 So I ventured in here today for a quick nosy hoping to see what was on sale. I figured nothing in these economic times could be TOO expensive...They had a lot of their items FULL PRICE much to my disdain, but I was pleasantly surprised to find a large bin on throw pillows for 75% I personally was in need for some and bought some super cute ones for $6.00 each originally $35.00 yeah great deal!!! So I was a happy camper...I even found two that matched that weren't damaged SCORE...They were setting up for Christmas so it was a little jumbled, but they had some cute Halloween stuff out but it was weird half the stuff was marked down and half wasn't, it was so confusing I just passed. I don't like the guessing game, either mark down the season or don't KWIM?All in all though a typical Pier One except for how disjointed everything was it was hard to find things, and they just don't have the cute sets of furniture like they used to :(
other Definitely come for Happy hour! Prices are amazing, sake bombers for $3...Great atmosphere and wait staff was incredibly nice and right on to all of our needs, didn't have to ask for a thing They were always spot on...Place gets crowded in the evening especially if you plan on sitting outside. I only wish there were one in Apollo Beach or Brandon!
other This is a family owned local restaurant at it's best. If you like to explore and support locally owned businesses, you should definitely give this one a try. They have a big menu and I have tried breakfast and lunch and both were excellent, but the breakfast is particularly good. I love the breakfast burrito. (to the reviewer that complained about the greasy chorizo...hello, it is chorizo, chorizo is sausage). I would go out of my way to stop and eat here whenever in the general area.
other I love the Tempe Library. The Culture Pass is a great program, the audiobook selection is good, and the seemingly unlimited resources are wonderful.
other Food middle of the road... The staff is rude.. Seems like it starts with the owner. I think she makes the staff pay for everything that goes wrong so in turn they dont want to fix issues with poor, wrong food etc.  I think she tends to forget the customers are actually what keeps a business open. For a long time it was the only choice in the area. Now there are multiple choices.  If your in the area Chili's or Connolys is much better choice in my oppinion.
other girlfriend and i always stop here on our treks to lee lee market.  If you haven't tried pho (pronounced fuh) , this is a great spot.  Basically its a beef soup thats a thousand times tastier than campbells.  its served with a plate of crisp and fresh veggies, like bean sprouts, jalapenos, basil, etc,  that you can throw in the soup.   i recommend using the spicy sauce that has roasted garlic in it instead of sriacha.   we also had the lemongrass beef salad which was equally good.  Everything is fresh and tasty with great service.  make sure you take dobson for the easiest entrance as pho ao sen is facing west!
other Big craft beer selection, in bottles and on tap. Not for those who go to a bar looking for mixed drinks (don't think they even sell liquor) or people who want to drink bud light. You're likely to find something you like, even if you're a picky beer drinker, you just might have a hard time narrowing down from the huge selection. The coolest thing about his place is the liquor store style fridges, filled with individually and six pack priced beers. You can just walk up to the fridges, pull out what you want and either drink it there or take it home. Definitely a unique place. They also sell food, which we didn't have, but was available. Next to food poses outside, and other bars and clubs.
other Very disappointed!!I picked this place because of the reviews that I've read here.  I feel compelled to give my other cents worth.We started out with jalapeno hushpuppies along with their remoulade.  The pups were very tasty (good start).For our main course, we ordered the fried green tomato salad to share, my wife ordered the gumbo with a side of fried okra, and I ordered the fried catfish with double okra on the side.The lag time between our pups and meal was LONG......outrageously long.  When they finally brought our meal, my wife didn't get her okra.  They explained that it would take a few more minutes.  Keep in mind, my plate had okra so I guess they must have forgot about hers.  It was no less than 10 minutes before they brought hers out.  When we finally received our meal the bartender apologized for the wait and explained that everything they have is fresh breaded and not frozen which is why it takes longer.  I can understand how fresh breaded takes longer but you should find a way to do it faster or take it off the menu if it's going to logjam your kitchen.All this being said, even after the wait, if the food was good I would be writing a positive review right now.  The problem is, the food was just so so.  The okra had NO flavor and was not fully cooked to a nice crisp crust.  My catfish flavor was ok but the breading was pretty thick.  My wife's gumbo was a little bland....almost like the roux was a little weak. I really wanted to like this place.  After our first experience, I won't likely go back.
other This place was old school when it old school was in session.  I can't spot any changes since it was one of the original Cork N' Cleavers - maybe new carpet, but that may be it.The salad bar is so old school, it still has jello - not jello shots - jello.  And since, I'm old school, I'm a fan of the salad bar.Monday other buck burgers with 2.50 salad bar is the only food you'll require for the whole day.  Decent burger too.Good barkeeps - they remember your name or call you hon (old school).The food is pretty basic, but they start with decent ingredients and prepare them well.  Had the prime rib a couple of weeks ago and my view is that the only way to eat prime rib is to have it breath it's last on the way from the kitchen to the table.  It was early enough in the evening that they were able to deliver a tasty hunk of meat that was as requested.If you're into modern, contempo kinds of joints, Feeney's won't be for you - but if you're in the mood for dark, old school, slightly seedy (in a good way) - then Feeney's  might just fit the bill.
other We live by and love this place! Happy hour is most def the biggest bang for your buck! Try the shrimp boil but only if you like your shrimp a little spicy!
3 This Mimi's is near the Reach1other complex where we were attending a tournament.  So, afterwards, we came here.The short version is that this is just like the Mimi's in Chandler.  The food is fine.  Not great, but fine.  The service was OK too.  Everyone enjoyed their food (I had the chicken pot pie).  None of it really struck me as "French", which is Mimi's motif, but it was good.  In fact, the kid had chicken picatta, which is Italian.  Not French.  They do have quiche, so maybe that's enough to claim to be a French-like bistro???  (Not in my book, honestly.)Anyway, I'd call this place average.  Really, I should give it 2.other stars, but that's not an option with Yelp.  An OK place to stop if you're in the area and looking for food.  You could do much worse.
other What's better than some refreshing, authentic Italian ice on a 11other degree day? Not much. Good variety of flavors, friendly owners, and a nice space. Enough said.
other These are some great cheesesteaks. I have come here multiplier times and have never left unhappy. The staff are nice and the food is delicious.  Also try the 'Cheesesteak Fries' they are freakin amazing! I am glad I work next to this place, always a great lunch.
3 3.other stars. Needed a place to avoid the rain before going to see Tron with my mom at the movie theater next door. We didn't order food, just drinks. There's an OSF in Seattle, and having gone a couple times, while not super familiar with the menu, I know what they serve. Our waitress was actually really awesome- she got us our drinks quickly and was super friendly with our touristy butts. Yeah... it's a chain. I know the food isn't the best and the service can be hit or miss. But the stars are all for our waitress, whose name I (of course) can't remember. I got the OSF version of a Jack and Coke, which had a cherry infused whiskey (it was dangerous, and at 7 dollars, doubly so), and my mom got a virgin Daquiri- our waitress put extra whip on it. A little touch, but one my mom really appreciated.
other I've always said if the guacamole, chips and salsa aren't good, the food is not likely to be good either.  I was right, Guacamole was not very good at all, same with the salsa.  Rest of the food was just okay but for a restaurant in the Biltmore I expected so much better.  Just as a note, when it comes to Mexican food, I'm super critical.  This place will probably get a higher ratings from people of the Midwest.
3 Not a bad sub which I find to be something I can eat almost daily.  Prices are a little higher than a Subway but their meat is freshly sliced to order and they do a much better job with their bread.  They are still lacking the hard crust french/Italian bread that I crave since leaving the East Coast but this is something I have learned not to expect out here in AZ.  The girls that work behind the counter are excellent and a few have been there for years.  They know service and are fast and great at keeping the lines at bay.
other I had the best culinary experience of my 8 years in Phoenix tonight. First time at Switch. Started off with some appetizers; pesto & sun dried tomato risotto, marinated chicken breast, Mac n cheese. All delicious!  Next my wife orders the blackened salmon. I looked at her with my wtf scowl. We don't even eat seafood. "It looks interesting" she says. Whatever. It gets to the table and it's the biggest hunk of salmon I've seen. We simultaneously stab into it with our forks, take a bite, and we look at each other like the first time we fell in love. The combination of the salmon, bacon and sautéed greens was out of this world. Coupled with the bread pudding and sweet tomato concoction put me over the top. We let the waitress know what we experienced and to thank the chef. She brought him out and he spoke with us for about 1other minutes. Jason is touched by the hand of God. He proceeded to tell us what he had planned for tomorrow's dinner menu and we made reservations on the spot for tomorrow night. I never knew food could profoundly affect your mood but I was driving home singing my heart out to my iPod. Got home, plugged the iPod into the stereo and continued the concert, danced with my dog and made me a latte.  Perfect night.  Thank you Jason and Switch.
other I moved from Philly this past summer and I've searched all over the Valley for a "GOOD" Pizza. After eating lots of tasteless and cardboard pizza, I found Momma Mia when I moved into Arcadia! I love the hole in the wall vibe! Just like home :) The sauce is great and super tasty! The dough tastes slightly sweet and is fluffy..It's what makes the pizza so great and there is a brickoven!! I love it! My husband and I order the pizza/wing special .The wings are so hot and spicy ( we order the hot, but it comes in buffalo and mild) They have an extensive menu of pasta, sandwiches and salads. I want to try their Philly Steak next, but for the time being I still make mine at home. Every pizza place likes to say its "New York Style", but this place really does a NYC pizza. Well the best nyc pizza you're gonna get in AZ, Something about the water.
other I went here for happy hour with a long time friend. I wanted to try something new and Switch totally fit the bill.First off, their happy hour is A-mazing! I had two glasses of white sangria that were just perfect. My friend and I shared the cheese and fruit plate because it was on special. It was nice to try everything, and since it was on special it made everything taste better.For my meal I had your traditional cheeseburger, and it was very good. I had half to take home which made for an excellent lunch the next day. The only thing about the place that was a little strange was the crowd. I expected for having such an awesome happy hour it would be busier, however it was kind of dead. I even saw a group of people be seated and abruptly leave. It was kind of strange. Perhaps it was just an off night. This is definitely a place I would go to again!
other Had a family style meal and everything was delicious.  Rigatoni in a cream sauce with chicken was outstanding, as was the pound cake dessert.  Appetizer stuffed mushrooms were also really good.On the pricey side, but nice for a special occasion.
other Wife and I had the large burgers. Many options as to toppings, whole grain bun is also an option. Store is spotless and staff is young and cheerful. I had sw style w/guacamole and jalapeno, spouse chose classic american cheeseburger. We ordered sweet potato fries to split. They are awesome and the single portion was large enough for other 1/other people. We were advised (in advance) that burgers would be pink inside, which we prefer. If you want yours well done, ask. You order at counter, and the food is brought to your booth. This was our second visit, and we would return. Store is nnear movies in food are of Tempe marketplace, so expect to spend some time looking for a spot.
3 Fine. Just fine. C+/B- average-- all around.    The decor was rustic and lodge-like, yet still open and modern.  No complaints here-- aesthetically pleasing and lacking the bright colors and loud mariachi music of more traditional Mexican restaurants.  The table we were sat at seemed to have been haphazardly wiped-- not totally clean. Our server was okay as well-- friendly enough, but seemed generally disinterested in her job and us and was not very knowledgable about the food she was serving. The food was fine.  The salsa served with the chips was totally fine-- fresh enough but not very flavorful-- a theme we would soon learn would repeat itself throughout our dining experience.  We started with the avocado egg rolls with cilantro honey dipping sauce.  These were the highlight of the meal-- the sweet sauce complimented the creamy avocado taste nicely.  My only qualm here was the $10.50 price tag for other standard sized egg rolls.  Seems a wee bit steep for what it was, but still very tasty.  I ordered the vegetarian tacos and they were good-- not wow, but good.  I appreciated the variety of vegetables and the fact that they had veggie tacos in the first place (many more standard Mexican restaurants do not).  I do wish they'd had more spices. The side of rice was pretty good, but not as flavorful as I'd like.  The veggie tacos are also served with some sort of pickled cabbage onion slaw (because the borracho beans that accompany the other dishes are cooked with bacon).  The slaw was also fine.  In general the food was acceptable, but a bit bland.  I should also mention that the portions are quite reasonable-- two smallish veggie tacos and a bit of rice and slaw.  Sometimes the portions as more traditional Mexican restaurants are absurdly gargantuan-- it was nice to see a normal sized and relatively healthy-seeming Mexican(ish) meal.Full disclosure here-- our visit to Black Chile was prompted by a card we'd received in the mail good for $20 off any meal.  So we figured it was worth a shot-- and it was, but maybe not a return visit.  Our bill (pre-discount) for the appetizer, other entrees, and two sodas came to $40.  If it wasn't at the Biltmore, I'd say it was a little steep, but considering its location, it's probably right on.  I'd go back if the food had wowed me, especially since it's in my neighborhood, but it didn't, so a repeat visit isn't likely.  There are enough solidly other and other star places in the vicinity that 3 stars doesn't generally make me a repeat customer.
other New Taco shops seem to be opening at a fast clip and America's stands out as one of the best. We absolutely love the quesadilla and the  tacos. The corn is also a must have. If you go with two people, don't miss their meal for two deal that includes two drinks. We can't wait until their 7th Ave store opens in January. Hopefully the quality will stay the same.
other I will tell you exactly why this place is so great.This place will blow your mind.  Not only is the service good, but the food is amazing.  Here is the rub, your friends are drunk and they start babbling on about wanting to go to some Mexican food restaurant that inevitably ends in the letters ____berto's.  It does not matter which, they all are basically the same.  You go and get your gut injected with evil and then are forced to deal with that for 10-1other hours. Talk about regret. Don't do it.  Like a child of abuse, you have the power to stop the cycle.Say "Nah" Like the famous sunglasses kid, "Let's go to Mi Patio and have some fantastic food, amazing service, and keep drinking to boot."  You will be a hero. You will make Ironman look like AquaMan (He's a Chump.  "You sir, command that fish into this taco."). Short list of amazing things to be had here:1. Margaritas.2. Mi Patio Taco. Not a taco and not a burrito. What is it?3. The Chips and Salsa 4. Chicken Tacos.  5.  Ice Tea. 6. Pacifico
other Amazing selection of beers with great tabs educating you on them and often ratings.  Wine and booze selections are great too.  Killer store like candyland for adults.  Prices are excellent and so is service if you need help finding something.  Great place!
other Wow. Best breakfast I had on my recent trip to Scottsdale. Ordered the eggs benedict with a side of corned beef hash. Waitress sweet talked the cook into making a side order since they typically don't do side dishes. That sweet little angel of a waitress made my day! Best corned beef hash EVER! Have I mentioned how awesome the waitresses were? And damn pretty as well. Double score.
other I would not recommend this place to anyone.  I went there looking for a gift.  I received no help.  The girl was too busy helping the wives of the baseball players.  I guess you need a large bank account to receive help in this store. Also, they did not have a very good selection of items. I think I will take my business to other stores who care about their customers.
other Meh.Maybe it was just that we decided to dine in 10 minutes prior to closing, but I was definitely not impressed. I had not been here in ages. Probably 10 years, maybe 15. No exaggeration. I remember nothing but good things about Miracle Mile. I remember being excited to come eat here. So one night while shopping at Arrowhead with a friend, I got a sudden craving for a pastrami sandwich with coleslaw and Thousand Island dressing. I was very excited to walk in and find that it was on the menu! I didn't have to special order it!It was a good size sandwich.  Big enough that when cut in half, you still have to use both hands. I took my first bite and was immediately disappointed. Not that it was bad. It's just that I had fond memories of this place and I was really expecting something near the level of perfection of the #19 at Langer's in Downtown L.A.....or at the least Like Gandolfo's in Tempe. Nope. It was nowhere near as good as either restaurant.  It was just okay. The bread had a slight toughness like it was day old bread. The meat was chewy and lacking flavor. The coleslaw was really good and had the perfect crunch. The flavor of the coleslaw was not strong, but still masked the flavor of the pastrami. I will stick with Jason's or Heidi's next time I have a hankerin' for another deli style sandwich.
other Although I am limiting meat in my diet, I went to the Keg for a date.I had only been one other time for drinks with a couple of friends and it was nothing worth writing home about really.I think what I really loved this time was the salad.  Yeah, I know, a steak house and I'm blown away by a salad!!  It was the spinach salad with walnuts and cranberries.  It was soooo good.  Of course my little girly sized fillet was incredible too.Oh ... and the date ... yeah it was good too!! ;-P
other GET. THE. CIDER. Just do it. I'm a huge cider fan and this is the best I've ever had. Not syrupy sweet, and nice and cloudy so you know that it's been brewed from actual fruit and not some secret sugar concoction. Their master brewer also brews all of their sodas. Grab a taster for the sodas and see which one you like best. My favorite is the vanilla. The staff is ridiculously friendly and willing to answer any questions you have and will have a nice chat with you if they're not busy. The sandwiches are quite tasty as well. I've had the Mario's Monster Mill-wich, and my boyfriend has had the tuna and the French dip. All have been really good, but if you don't like a lot of feta on your sandwich I would suggest letting them know because they really pile it on (Mario's)! I love it so it was no problem for me.
other I am always on the prowl for a good burger so when I heard there was a new burger place in Tempe I knew I had to try it out.The boyfriend and I went to Lobby's on a Friday night. It was not busy but the location doesn't really lend itself to busy. So we were able to walk right in and order. It's an order at the counter and grab a seat kinda place. We both ordered cheeseburgers and got an order of fries to share. I liked that the burgers were not pre-made frozen patties. They threw down two hunks of beef on the grill.The burgers were tasty, a nice size - not too big, not too small - and the fixin's were fresh. So was the bun. The fries were crinkle cut but they were crispy and good.The atmosphere was fine, good for a quick sit-down and the staff was friendly.I hope they can survive in this location because they are worth a repeat visit for sure.
3 One of the reviewers said this owner wants to run a restaurant - I completely agree.  That has good sides and bad of course in short it isn't Palette  ... We stopped in for brunch last Sunday - the French Toast is Challah [which I love] restaurant-baked I think - and seemingly not fully baked - the center was dough.  The scrambled eggs were adequate - the restaurant-made salsa verde was excellent; the Schreiners sausage as expected.  That was all we had - quality not a compelling reason to return ... until the service is factored in - crisp timely and friendly.  I'll be back to try dinner.
other I continue to give Golden Egg Roll other stars.  I love the house chicken and schezwan chicken (I'm sure I misspelled that).  I did not like the Hunan chicken; however, I despise bell peppers and didn't realize they were in this meal until after I got it.  Golden Egg Roll became a regular place for me to go to because it was cheap and better than decent.  Now that I've moved, I'm going to miss this place.
other Awesome, awesome, awesome....everything was fantastic. The innovative drink menu, the pizza was out of this world and the bartender was very personable. A++ I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Ban't wait to return!
3 Took my family here for dinner.  The hamburgers were really good.  I had the regular charburger, and i liked it quite a bit.  It was better than most of the fast food chains, but I'd rank it below the higher end burgers from places like Fuddruckers or Red Robin.   For the price though, I was very satisfied.  My 8 year old really liked her charburger with cheese, but my other daughters did not like the grilled cheese at all.  I was not impressed by either the regular or sweet potato fries, but the onion rings were good.  We did not get any dessert, although the sundaes and milk shakes looked really appealing.  We'll try those next time.
other We went to "THE PLACE" for breakfast/lunch today. It must be a popular spot and was very busy. There were other specials of the day, Eggs Benedict and a French Toast stack. Both came with a choice of potatoes.I went here based on the reviews from fellow Yelpers. My daughter ordered the burger, it came with fries AND salad for under 7.00. The burger was very well done, but it was 1/other lb of ground beef. The fixings were on the side and it arrived on an unremarkable hamburger bun. The fries were crisp and the salad was fine but it was DRENCHED in a watered down thousand island dressing.My eggs benedict was fine. Nothing to make me want to order it again, but not bad either. I would try their pancakes next time. They looked pretty good!My husband's french toast stack arrived. 3 pieces of french toast with ham,egg and swiss cheese between the layers. Kinda like a Monte Cristo sandwich. They bring out warm maple and berry syrup. My husband liked it. But, said he would try something else next time.I ordered my hashbrowns extra crispy, my husband ordered his "burnt", his order came out exactly how i wanted mine. Crispy dark golden and cooked well. Bummer I had to just eat the top of mine. We also wanted to try the biscuits and gravy. What a big let down. Quantity does not equal quality. The biscuits were large, and the gravy bland. Our service was ok. The people working there seem nice enough. They were giving out free THE PLACE frisbees.They will be closing 7/2other and will re open 8/other at the new location right up the street at 51st ave and Bell rd, in the old 3 Margaritas building.Hopefully I will be able to update this one day and give a better rating. But for now, I will stick to Ronnie's Cafe on Cactus rd. as my go to breakfast joint.
3 Enjoyed dinner on the patio - I had the Pad Cha Seafood dish rated "Thai hot" - the so-called hottest dish on the menu.  The person I was with ordered the ginger fish - mediocre at best, although it looked great with a variety of vegetables and pineapple.  I felt the dishes looked better than they actually tasted.  The seafood (mussels, calamari, salmon, shrimp) in my dish was very fresh but it wasn't Thai hot at all.  The ambiance of their patio was enjoyable and the Thai iced tea was very tasty although a little too sweet towards the end.  Overall, I will probably give this restaurant another try in the future but I wasn't very impressed with the taste of the food.
other I have been looking for a great therapist for a long time.  Someone that takes the time to read my body, to see the synergy of the muscles and be able to do the work.  Finally, I found Robert.  He has been an LMT for more than 1other years in the Valley and continues to educated himself often.  His studio is located conveniently just off of the 5other about 10 minutes in a quiet residential neighborhood.The massage intake questioning was thorough, but not invasive.  His set up is calming and the room & table were warmed by a heater!  The massage lasted 90 minutes or so, I didn't want to go back to the real world.  He does offer Gift Certificates and has Pay Pal set up on his website if you didn't plan ahead with stopping for cash.  I will definitely visit him again when I need the work!
other part of a social event, we only had app's here. quite delicious crab cakes and a shrimp fritters with mango sauce. the portions were gigantic and actually big enough for a meal. i was slightly full afterwards. part of the roaring fork, wildfish franchise, they also offer a great happy hour. seems a bit high priced but our bill was taken care of, so i'd save this (for the middle class foodie) for a special event.
other I can't believe I haven't yelped about the place yet. Several months (maybe over a year?) ago my husband read a newspaper article about the Clover coffee maker and the one place in town that had managed to procure one. I was skeptical (as is my nature). It can't be that much better right? You're just saying it's amazing because you want to talk about the new hot coffee shop you discovered, right? Well, maybe. But I love this place. And I don't think it has a whole lot to do with the Clover. They roast their own beans and they roast them way differently than that other ginormous coffee chain - all a light or medium roast. Never bitter, never oily, never yucky. The coffee they make there is, obviously, the best. But I send my husband in every week now to buy a pound of beans so that I can approximate the same coffee at home. Add an edgy (though sometimes intimidating) seating area, great local art (which we bought off the wall), and smiley service...I'm sold. Can't wait to try out the downtown location.
other When you specialize in something, then you should know it and do it well. This is the Zinburger approach to burgers. Our server, besides being very attentive and friendly, was also extremely knowledgeable about the preparation and ingredients. It showed me that Zinburger really knows their burgers and takes the time to educate their staff. It also served to heighten my expectations...which weren't let down.The quality of my burger was very apparent. The bun was fresh, the meat was high grade, and the other ingredients were also well thought out. I love when restaurants are meticulous with their creations. This is a superb burger, expertly prepared from the creation of the patty (not too compressed) to the cooking of it (a perfectly pink in the middle "medium" is what I ordered and received). Simply great.The milkshakes are over-the-top rich and delicious--like eating whole pint of Haagen Dazs. We all shared one, and it was still overkill. Great tasting though.The fries were a little "meh" to me. Not sure why. They were hot & fresh, but a little bland. I tried the Truffle Fries as well, and they were also a little boring. Maybe they should try a different kind of oil or potato...or both. They were decent fries, just not as "top notch" good as the burgers.Lastly, for a "burger joint," the service was excellent...to the point of fine dining type pampering. Very nice. Overall, I'm a fan. I'm looking forward to returning.
other We checked out RnR on Sunday (just a few days after opening.) In all fairness, I have to agree with many of the other reviews. Even though they are new, these things are fixable so hopefully the feedback will be taken in the appropriate vein. The building is very cool and the vibe was energetic on a sunny Sunday morning. There was an abundance of waiters but they seemed to be confused and frenetic without a real focus on the customer. The menu is very limited and our server had not eaten most of the items. He was struggling to explain. Our drinks took more than 1other minutes to arrive even though we saw them sitting at the bar for the entire time. Our water had just disappeared. Then the food. I ordered the grill cheese ( a rare treat and when I order it I want it good!). It was cold and overwhelmed by heavy bread. The cheese wasn't melted. I sent it back and they simply nuked it and brought it out. Icky. Our son wanted a kids cheeseburger and the staff kept coming back and forth not sure if there was a single burger or sliders for kids. It became comical after the third person came out. My husband ordered a salmon omelet with several additional fixings. The eggs tasted like box eggs and it was lackluster and flavorless. We even took the time to provide feedback to management but we got a weak smile and "come back and try us again." He made no effort to "make things right" either by comping something else to taste or providing an incentive to come back. There are too many restaurants in town to have to go to one that is less than mediocre. The young crowd may enjoy it for the bar vibe it gives but the majority of the tables on Sunday am were families or middle aged and we saw similar responses at other tables.
3 The restaurant has 6 tables which make it possible for you to eat-in, but this place is definitely more suited towards take out or delivery.  Just don't expect service if you eat-in.  You order at a counter and if you choose to eat-in, you will get your soup in a take out container, eat on paper plates and styrofoam cups, but get your entrees served on platters.The house special won ton soup was pretty tasty and was loaded with a variety of fresh veggies, as well as chicken, pork, and shrimp pieces.  However, one key ingredient was missing - won tons!General Tso's chicken was fried and served with broccoli and sufficient sauce.  The Mongolian beef was more Mongolian and less beef.Overall the food was OK, except for the disappointment of the missing wontons, and I would probably consider this place again for delivery.
other We had a very difficult time finding trail 20other which was noted as one of the more strenuous hikes. We took trail 100 and came across some extreme mountain bikers, several other hikers and a couple who gave us confusing directions on how to reach one of the highest sections of the mountain. We got lost and ended trail busting which is highly discouraged but give us rules and we will break  em. During our run back down the trail I took a pretty hard fall face planting into the dirt, stabbing my right hand into a rock and banging up my knee. No broken bones or teeth, thankfully. We had just passed a couple of hikers when I took the fall so they saw everything. I laid there for about 10 seconds, jumped back up, noticed the blood, my torn tee and just continued on with the hike. We came across a park ranger who was standing outside his truck and asked if he had any medical supplies. Unfortunately, his first aid kit was about 20 years old and didn't contain anything that would help any of my wounds. We found a CVS on our way home and picked up some medical supplies and my wounds were washed and bandaged in the parking lot. Probably my most memorable hike thus far.
other Found this place from yelp and had to check it out based on the great reviews. All I can say is wow! This place is super yummy! I have a new favorite! Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed. My only downfall was they don't accept Amex cards.
other A new breakfast option in old town Scottsdale. The decor is superb and the weekend crowd is minimal. Juevos Rancheros and the Skirt Steak & Eggs are both fabulous. Prices for breakfast are reasonable.
other Amazing food. Great date night place with an impressive wine list.  Definitely come her again and more often.
other I can't add much to what has already been said....BUT I'll try, haha!Um, don't come here without a map, or some sort of gps device (NOTE: some spots in the mountain do not get good reception, so a map on your phone may not always fully come in). It is VERY easy to get lost!There are many trails, I look forward to getting to know them better. So far, all I have really done is Mormon Trail and the Hidden Valley Loop.....Fat Man's pass is probably my most favorite spot...OH! AND there are some really cool rock formations on the way there (including a natural tunnel) look for the rock that looks like a big mushroom!This is a good area to do a hike in the dark....but don't do it until you've done the trail a couple times in daylight. You can see what seems like the whole valley from up there! If you do the night hike, make sure the moon is full.....you can actually see pretty well with that and the city lights. Plus, it's GORGEOUS! (if you did mormon trail at night, you could start about an hour before sunset, then head back as the sun goes down)Don't forget water, it is a moderate level hike.....and flashlights would be a good idea too, just in case :)
3 Had lunch here a couple of days ago.  Place was dead.  Only one other table had people at it.  Service was quick.  Reuben sandwich I ordered was delivered promptly.  Meat was tasty but not exactly plentiful (I'm used to a New York style Reuben - with loads of meat).  Potato salad that came with the sandwich was very good, a pleasant surprise.  Outdoor seating was nice, though the birds did get tiresome.  Place seemed clean.  Plenty of seats.  Upstairs deck area would be great in the evening.  Seems like it would be a much more fun place with a group of people for happy hour  or dinner than it was for lunch.  Bottom line - it was okay.  Not bad, not great.  I'd give it another try but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again.
other I can't believe I hadn't been here before yesterday!  Talk about a hidden gem!  I was taking a friend around to cross stuff off her "List of Stuff to do Before the World Ends" and smoking a hookah happened to be on it.  Therefore I googled places nearby us and Oasis popped up.As soon as we got there the guy at the door welcomed us in with a smile and opened the door for us and once inside the waitress/bartender helped us pick a table and took our drink orders.  We decided to get the peach hookah and an order of the Hummus and Pita Deluxe with beef.  The food was delicious and the hookah was great!  The staff was awesome the entire night as well.  Everyone kept checking on us to see if we needed anything and they would just stop and chat with us as well.  One guy was even helping my friend try to make smoke circles!  I definitely love that they're open until other am on Fridays and Saturdays too because it's always nice to have somewhere to wind down after all the bars close!
other Great place. Sushi was not wrapped up tied enough so it tended to fall apart. Also the roll was a bit thick that it is hard to fit it in your mouth (yeah, that's what she said:)
other I could spend hours in this place. In fact, I know I have. There are so many things to look at and it's way more than just books. They have a ton of cards and stationary as well as fun trinkets. If you're into used books, this is the place to go. I've found nearly mint condition vintage books here and they've made the perfect gifts. The people who work here are great as well. They're more than willing to help and offer good recommendations. This is a go to if you're looking for a good read or just want to pop in and explore.
other Tried Bombay Spice last night. After reading the website and reviews, it seemed like it would fit perfectly our combined need to finally find good Indian fare in Phoenix AND not blow our calorie budget (husband and I are trying--and succeeding!-- in losing weight). Success on both counts!It was Saturday at about 6:30 and we were seated immediately. The place was almost full. We sat on the patio, which was lovely, but might get too hot during the summer (I didn't see any misters--You're Welcome, Mother Earth!).  Service was attentive, and our waitress gave us several recommendations. We ordered:Somosas (baked, I think, not fried, which made them a little messier to eat but still very very tasty).Naan (chewy, moist, naan-y...yum)Grilled Shrimp skewers (a little on the skimpy side, but very tasty, and served with grilled peppers and onions and a delightful mint sauce).We each ordered individual entrees with basmati. They encourage you to order the two-entree choice, but we were trying to avoid over-ordering, and it turned out to be exactly the right amount of food. I ordered the Cauliflower and potatoes, which was moist, savory, a little spicy, and very tasty, albeit lacking a little in the sauce department (I would have liked a little something to spoon over my rice).Husband ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, which was exceptional. They claim that they don't use cream in their food, so I don't know how they made the masala sauce so creamy and good, but they did and I'm not going to question it any more! I would have licked the bowl if we had been at home. Next time I think we'll get some apps again but try the Bombay Plate to share, which is other entree choices and rice. That way we can try a whole bunch of things. $3other before tip for naan, two appetizers, and two single-choice entrees. Not bad for a Saturday out. We'll definitely be back, even though it was  kind of a drive for us.
other It's a nice newer gym with a good amount of amenities and a relatively friendly staff.  I see cleaners in the club every time I am there which I dont see a lot of at other gyms.  They have a stretch room, full wet area with steam and sauna, free aerobics classes,  a large number of equip,etc.The evenings do get crowded even with all the equipment, so I try to get in and out before other or so.All in all a nice spot to get a work out in the area.
other "You want a piece of me?" said the gargantuan mango tango eggees cup. I said "YES, I DO!" and give me a big ol veggie samich and some fries to go with my brain freeze thank you very much. Todays order is same ol same ol 1other inch whole wheat extra veggie grinder with extra crispy fries and a bigee flavor (mango tango) $6.50 w/ the captain card. How can you beat this kind of scratch for two people. you cannot.It was Yuuuummmmae!Unfortunately there is not much choice for vegan here but its all about the eegees!I now will add eegees to Best vegan for the money! and to Best far away vegan. Check it! you will be glad you did!Review timeCurbage: 10 I really like the fancy shmancy new eegees,but I like all eegeesP factor: 10 very clean as usualOrdering: 10 no wait at allMeal arrival: 10 even with extra crispy fries it was fastTaste test: 10 yummy today and the mango tango is now my second fav to cherry ciderSummary: 10 Thank you eegees! see you next month.Late gordo
other i go to debon every 3 weeks for aki the hairdresser.  she's very nice and asks you a lot of quesitons to make sure you get what you want.  she is reasonably priced.
other My favorite Mexican food.  THE BEST BEAN BURRO ENCHILADA STYLE IN THE WORLD (yes I've tried them all)  Get the red enchilada sauce, and a tortilla on the side.
other Waffle Houses are bomb but this one is my favorite.  Not only is it 2other hours but it is super clean and well lit.  There are totally some seedy people who go here but their conversations just make for very interesting background noise.  As far as the food, the prices are cheap, the menu is semi-a-la-carte and the the waffles are amazingly crisp and perfect.  This is THE Waffle House to visit.  Go now, do it.  How good does a waffle sound right now anyways?  That's right, Pretty Damn Good.
3 I went to Five Guys for the first time (North Scottsdale) to see what all the hubbub was and why everyone was comparing it to In 'N Out burger - a place I love and have been eating at for over 2other years (CA and AZ).  Pros: wider assortment of toppings and menu items, including the veggie sandwich (not a soy pattie - just veggies and cheese, if you want; extra menu items like jalapeños and hot sauce, grilled mushrooms, etc.; Cajun styled french fries (their small size is enormous).Cons:  more expensive than In 'N Out. Neutral: Thick burgers are more like your home grilled burgers, all well done and crispy on the edges - not like In "N Out's thinner patties.I don't know why people compare the two places since the prices are not similar.  Five Guys is good, but should be compared more to places like Fat Burger, regarding size and price of burger.I still prefer In "N Out for taste and value.
other Delicious gourmet crepes. Friendly staff. Awesome environment. Price is right. Eat here, it's good.
other So, clearly the musician's make the night.  Our night was not so hot.   Half of the bad that we caught wasn't worthy of stage time, the other half was.  The horn players were exceptional, the Keyboardist wasn't.  I'll stick to the facility.  The Rhythm Room is a Phoenix, classic on the music scene, or so I'm told.  This was evident when Paul Reed showed up with his horn and just joined the band on stage.  That was cool and made you feel like you were in the right place.  Beyond that, I'm can't really claim that this place is worth the time.  We'll have to try it again to confirm, yet my urge to do so isn't high right now.  The neighborhood is questionable.  The entrance is not obvious, the bar and the service are not inviting.  The music area of the building is excellent.  You sit very close to the band.  The one thing they need to fix within that is two sets of band doors would allow for a much faster setup/teardown between bands.  We waited for an hour between bands.  The Rhythm Room is missing an opportunity here, they need a comedian or something the fill the gap.  Some fresh eyes on how this place is run could really make some simple improvements.  Just because it's a known classic doesn't mean that it can't change for the better.  The one thing they have right is that the sound is good and if they're getting good bands, then it makes for a great night.  The annoyances only become obvious when you have an hour to descern them between bands.The musician's interaction with the crowd before and after shows is really cool.  This makes everyone involved feel like they're in the scene.
other This other star rating is mostly for their boba! They are cool about how many flavors I put into my boba (usually about 4!) unlike other boba shops that only allow like 2Their ramen is pretty good and decently priced. However, I don't like coming to this place much ONLY because I don't like coming out smelling like an Asian restaurant.
other This is my first time trying this place and I had a wonderful experience. The place was packed and yet they got me in right away. A young man gave me a pedicure and did a spectacular job. They even put on a timer for 1other mins to ensure I got a full massage during it. They offered the other services but did not force any on me. I will definitely use them again and recommend the place to others.
other The service was slow, the server knew nothing of the wines on the menu and knew nothing of proper wine service.  Boo.
other Nic-nacs galore!
other 6.30 on a Sunday and there was a line snaking through the small shop. We took turns sneaking peaks at the day's options and by the time we got up front we were ready to order. We got the salted caramel and chocolate marshmallow. The 1st was so good, the 2nd kinda boring.Can't wait to try more.
other Door clearly says drive-thru open 2other hours and lobby till midnight. Drove up at 10:30 and was told the lobby was closed...lame...
other Okay...this was very surprising since it was just voted Best Southwestern food in PHX mag's Best of the Valley issue...and thus, it made us want to have a visit.I LOVE southwestern food...and I was very let down by this place.  I feel like I should give it 3 stars...but as an "A-OK" rating, I just can't.  If 3 stars were for "OK food" then I'd give it 3 stars.  But truly, I have...I have had better.PHX Mag said to try the crab cakes, which we did, and they were delicious.  Very happy with them and therefore expected the entrees to be just as great...but they weren't.  : (  I had the salmon, which the waitress recommended and it was such a bummer.  It had way too many conflicting tastes going on that didn't seem to blend at all.  I lost my appetite after a few bites.  My boyfriend had the shrimp tacos which were just...average.  We were really disappointed.  Again, the crab cake appetizer was great and the two margaritas were as well - the Tontorita and the Prickly Pear - both very, very yummy.  But overall, if PHX Mag continues to recommend more lame-oid meals, I'm gonna have to start using it as wrapping paper instead of a go-to guide for great meals in this town.
other This is a tough one.  It's probably the best Filipino restaurant in the Phoenix area.  But that's not saying much, because the few there are here are really not good.  Compare Jeepney Bistro to one of the places in Filipino Town (Los Angeles), and they get blown away.And, for the record, my wife is a Filipina.  And she cooks MUCH better than the chef here.  No contest.  A lot less grease/fat/oil, that's for sure!!Also, their portions are a bit small.  Bigger than a few other places I could name, but still small.If you really want some Filipino food, and you don't know my wife to beg some from her, this is probably your best option without driving to LA.  But don't form your opinion of Filipino food based on this place.  Go to LA and try Bahay Kubo Natin, or some others, and you'll get a much better idea of what the cuisine is about!
other We went to American Junkie after we found a 50% discount from http://www.restaurant.com. They couldn't pay us to go back.If you like velvet ropes, not being able to talk to the person next to you because the music is so loud, and being around people who are really into themselves, American Junkie is your spot.
3 I was up for a cold sugary drink before getting onto my flight so I walked over to the Wendy's next to this place. The guy at this place looked bored so I walked over to his counter to buy the drink. He was quite friendly and very prompt to charge me for the drink, which was quite a bit cheaper than the same drink at Wendy's. He also said I could either use the Coke machine or the iced tea dispensers. He had two kinds of iced tea, regular and a green blackberry. I took a little bit of the green blackberry which was very refreshing and tasted pretty good. I then went over to the Coke machine to get that. The sign on the Coke machine basically said once you buy a cup, you can refill it again and again the same day of purchase. I'll remember this if I ever have a layover in Phoenix. The prices at the Starbucks in this airport would drain my wallet fast if I had to be in the airport for any amount of time.
3 The banana pecan french toast was great - order a 1/other order and split it with someone else for "breakfast desert"!Rest of the food was definitely better than ok, but dropped my review to 3 stars because restrooms weren't clean and had no hand soap -- where are employees washing their hands???
other A couple of us came here Friday and had a good time. I liked the off-the beaten path location and the fact that there was no cover. They have 2-4-other drinks 8-10pm, too. I thought the music was good and drinks weren't too expensive. The thing that almost ruined my time was constantly being bumped by people. It is hard to get into the groove when you are being shoved and pushed by people who think they have an entire dance floor to themselves. But isn't that every place, though?
other Now open on Saturdays!!!! Yes!!!!!
3 Excellent food, top-notch service, exorbitantly priced.  Not for budget minded diners...
other I can not believe that pizza could be this good. I had good pizza on a recent trip to NY, and this really is the closest that I can find to the pizza out there.They say that its the water, but I am skeptical of that. I guess it doesn't matter what they did to make the pizza, it was really, really good.
other If I was on death row and had to choose a meal for my "last supper" I would include the New Mexico Skillet (hold the chorizo) from Butters. I have searched high and low for any other breakfast place that compares to Butters and I cannot find anything. I thought that I had found a close contender in Perk Eatery in North Scottsdale but a second visit proved that they were not consistent.Butters is consistently amazing. The service is strangely fast but you'd have to be crazy to complain about that. Their menu is creative and there is a really great variety of food. I always want to try the crepes or french toast but I just can't bring myself to get anything other than the New Mexico skillet. Maybe one day I'll branch out.
other Sakana is one of the few sushi places that I return to. There is usually always a wait (no reservations, which is a PITA), but the sushi is fresh, service is quick (so it's not always super friendly), and the calamari salad is SO effin good. Their lunch specials remind me of something I'd find in So. CA-- tasty, filling and reasonably priced. It's lively on the weekends with several tables doing sake bombs so it's a fun place to celebrate birthdays.
other If I were ever to be executed, I'd want a Meat & Cheese pasty for my last meal. With two red wine gravy.It's *that* good.
other Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner, love Wildflower. For breakfast the stuffed french toast is awesome, lunch any of their sandwiches are good. I don't really care for the salads but I love the Potato cream cheese soup. The ice tea is so good and the desserts are wonderful. My favorite thing is the Salmon Alfredo, that they serve with yummy garlic toast. I like the order at the front and they bring it to you, very convenient and I don't have to tip!
other I love the Starbucks in the Safeway here. Marissa...the girl who is normally the barista...is so nice!
3 Better than rubio's or filaberto's by a long shot open late and has a drive through. When i walked in it was packed and i noticed how cheap the beer and Margarita's were. Wait... I don't remember having ever seen a hole-in-the wall Mexican spot serving booze before (wonder if they sell it via drive through). The menu is like a Jewish Torah being that it has a 100,000 words and is very hard to read. The tacos and burritos also come w/ a side of toquitos that is buried under chiuaua cheese and guacamole. Shrimp and fish taco's are made on tortilla's are made in house. Food is super cheap and tasty. Its too bad that all their locations are in the middle of nowhere.
3 I like the idea of Sidebar, but I don't really love the place. The drinks are decent, so I would go there for that- though I just have never found it to be very fun. Once I went in and had an amazing bartender from Sanfrancisco- I really enjoyed that visit, but then the next time I had this bartender guy and he was really uptight and condescending whenever anyone asked him a question. It really bugged me, and it made it a less fun experience. I have never gone back.
other I know my other girlfriends that absolutely LOVE this place will balk at my other stars instead of 5. But honestly, I think this place is slightly overrated. Don't get me wrong, I like this place, and I oblige them every time they want to go, but I think other stars is just right for the rating. We went there this weekend, and the typical scenario went down. Parking was cramped (lucked out to get a "valet" spot which I parked into myself as it was right out front by the entrance - no I'm not waiting for you Mr. Valet Dude to get into my car and pull it forward into the spot right in front of my face, thank you very much), and there was a short wait (maybe 10-1other minutes). We sat outside, which wasn't ideal since it was cold and drizzly, but we had patio heaters on both sides of our table so it was OK. Sadly we didn't make their $other wine special, which ends at 5pm, so we were paying full price for the glasses of wine - ranging from $8 to about $12-13. I don't know about you, but I really am not a fan of paying $10 for a glass of wine when I can pay that for an entire bottle. But alas, I had other different wines through the course of the night, both on recommendation from the servers, and both decent. We ordered the infamous bruschetta, with the other choices being: smoked salmon (YUM!), warm artichoke (tasty), roasted red pepper (still good), and white bean with tomato (OK, but nothing to write home about). For dinner, I had the half & half combo (where you get to choose other different items), and I chose the mixed green salad (REALLY delicious, with an awesome combination of greens, pears, grapes, gorgonzola cheese, pecans, & poppyseed dressing) and half of a turkey/pesto pannini. The pannini was QUITE boring. Didn't have much flavor at all. I think it was lacking on the pesto. And honestly, this is what I come to expect at Postino. Some things are just unbelievable and you want to lick your plate clean, and other things are simply boring and tasteless (like the white bean/tomato bruschetta and the turkey/pesto pannini). And hence my rating of other stars rather than 5. If the parking was easier, the wines were always $other a glass, and the food was consistent, I would give it other stars. Fair enough?  :)
other Visited the restaurant tonight and was very pleased.  I found the decor charming and elegant.  The atmosphere is amazing sans the hustle and bustle of most of the local chain like restaurants.  The place was devoid of the stereotypical Scottsdale element we prefer to avoid.  I found the prices easily justifiable in fact I though them quite reasonable.  We had the three onion tart appetizer, which was spectacular. For entrees we had salmon, filet, and a pair of lamb shanks.  Everything was wonderful.  The presentation was clean and the freshness and quality of the proteins, produce and accoutrement's was immediately evident.  Everything was cooked skillfully.  Had three of the four desserts on the menu.  The chocolate raspberry tart definitely stood out followed closely by the berry tart.  Delicately prepared and presented these were really an unexpected treat.  The environment is wonderful for Dining and chatting with people you actually like. The interior is intimate and it lends itself well to the cuisine.  I found the staff courteous, knowledgeable and professional.  We will be frequenting often and I encourage others to visit.
other So I e-mailed East Maryland the same afternoon as my visit, explaining that I was disappointed that the coupon I had given them was not honored, and they e-mailed me back before the end of the day, apologizing and letting me know that my Visa would be credited the amount of the coupon. Then they called today to see how the boys were all doing after their shots, and acknowledged the bill issue again, and hoped that everything had been settled to my satisfaction.This kind of immediate and friendly follow-up redeemed them and gained them another star.
other Love this place. Quaint.  Nice owners.  The meatloaf is fantastic.  Reminds me a little of home in Mn.  .. . old house.
other I didn't realize that this store was very close to my home. I used to go to "Musician's Discount on Southern and Alma School Road. However, I had went there Saturday and it was closed, so I decided to check out what other stores are around. The customer service was good, and they were also helpful regarding some questions that I had regarding electric guitars. I didn't really compare prices to other places, so I cannot honestly respond in price comparison. I had noticed that they had a lot of novelty- shaped guitars. they also seemed to have a large quantity of replacement strings for guitars. They also appear to have a large selection of sheet music.  I recommend checking them out if you are looking for a music (instrument) store near Dobson and Baseline Road in Mesa, Arizona.
other I didn't think my experience staying there was as bad as previous yelp reviewers...my stay was short, but, quiet and nice...service was good, and I had a restful night, the only thing I probably will suggest is,turn off the A/C before you go to sleep, that helps a lot (not summer season I mean)...
other 3 1/other Stars.Girl's choice last night.... and we (my sister, my niece Carol, and myself) ended up at the Famous Dave's in Chandler. These Famous Dave's look like every other one... typically bright Orange and Yellow! At night, you must have deficient eyesight if you can't find a Famous Dave's! In the evening, Famous Dave's is just a lighthouse beacon in the middle of a drab mall!On the menu...Blue Margarita (** 1/2) made with Blue Curacao - It's disconcerting when the last time you saw your niece she was just drinking Cokes... now it's Blue Margaritas. Must be getting old. In summary... not very toxic. Could have drank this in one gulp and wouldn't have had an effect! Machine mixed and made. Looked cool, though, with an Aquamarine Blue color.All American BBQ Feast (****) Gimmick is that all this stuff ( Full Slab of St Louis style SpareRibs (*****), Whole BBQ Chicken (*** 1/2), 1/other lb of Texas Beef Brisket (*****), Famous Fries (*****), other Baked Potatoes with all the Fixin's (*****) replaced the Coleslaw and Wilbur Beans, other Corn on the Cob (***), other Muffin Style Corn Bread (****) ) is served on a bright, shiny, galvanized Garbage Can lid. Some of the items definitely lacking in BBQ flavor.Hot Fudge Kahlua Brownie (**) Warm, Walnut covered Chocolate Brownie, soaked with Kahlua Liquer and topped with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Hot Fudge, and (loads and loads of) Whipped Cream. Ice Cream and Kahlua was no-where to be found!Total tab: $82.08. Not bad for the amount of food.Service (****) This is a total generalization... but what the heck! The wait-staff at Famous Dave's is totally opposite from the previous evening's robotic lifeless performance from the wait-staff at Olive Garden ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/olive-garden-italian-restaurant-chandler#hrid:l6HajH2UNtb1EZMTj19Ccg  ). I really don't give a darn if it's just a performance... the attitude that the wait-staff presents will be passed onto the customers... whether bad or good.Typical of all Famous Dave's you sit at a booth or table covered with Red and White checkered table-cloths. At the front entrance is a display of all the BBQ awards that Famous Dave's BBQ items have won.... mostly in the MidWest. Check out the lead-pipe utilitarian interior design... Cool!Very colorful and festive atmosphere! Kids or adults with a kid's attitude will love Famous Dave's.
other Hey Thai Elephant! Stop sucking! You used to be so good. Why is my egg roll cold? Why don't I get a fork with my food.... after asking!? Why won't you make me the Tiger on Fire for lunch when I got it last week for lunch?... AND it's on the menu! When did you decide to cut my curry portion in half almost? When did your service start sucking? Hey every person that decided that my two top was not important enough to attend! Why did it take 10 minutes to order my drink and then an additional ten minutes to actually get my drink? By the way, Tiger beer is on your menu. If you are not going to actually offer it, then you need to take it off your menu. I can't believe it's come to this... I used to love you. You broke my heart for the last time.
other I had never heard of this place until some friends from out of town brought us a bottle of the olive oil. So when I had out of town company visiting, we made a trip to the Olive Mill and signed up for the tour. The tour is not really much of a tour, but more of a 20-2other minute lesson on growing and harvesting olives, and then a look at the equipment used to press the oil. Our tour guide was very entertaining and funny. While there was a long period of standing, there is very little walking so really anyone can get their $other worth.While waiting for the tour to start, we wandered around the store and then enjoyed the wine and cider tasting outside. They also have live music every Saturday. After the tour we filled several sample cups with a variety of olive oil flavors, and bought a loaf of bread, and enjoyed figuring out what was in each cup. The line to order food was too long, so we didn't stick around for a meal, but everything looked wonderful. The only less than positive thing I have to say is that they really promoted the Pork Shop down the road, so we went there hoping to load up on ready made food (since we had opted not to wait in line for Olive Mill food). It's actually a butcher shop that also sells a few cooked items. There were BBQ pork burritos, green chili burritos, and spare ribs. The pork burrito was alright, but the sauce overwhelmed the meat so that's all you could really taste. The ribs were really a disappointment. They are around $6-7 a pound, and although they were meaty, it took way too much work to get the meat off of the bones. Perhaps a few more hours in the oven, and they would have been better - but I don't recommend going out of your way to check this place out.
other Put it in the baby book.  Baby's first AJ's.  And you'll always have a special soft place in your heart for your first.  I love that while this location is in a nice part of town, it's not quite the same level of frou-frou as many other spots.  That means rather than dealing with the Scottsdale types who have to dress up to go to the store - you're dealing with a greater range of folks - but they are all willing to pay a bit more for the good stuff.  I will say, you'll pay less for a box of cereal or box of triscuits at a Circle K than you will at an AJ's. And I don't think I've ever seen anything on sale.  But there is just nothing like their fresh food.  Be it produce or the meat section, the colors are brighter, the items are bigger and you just know it's going to taste better.  Their chicken breasts and pork chops are so amazingly good, and so large, you want to eat them all at once, but you just can't.  You have to try some of their pre-prepped meats.  My fav is a pork loin with apple stuffing.  Wow. And of course, great pre-made foods too if you just want to pick up something to go.  I've been suckered in to their desert section far too many times.  And they are always good.  But dang they can be pricy - so it really has to just be a special splurge.  If you haven't tried an AJ's yet, I suggest this one to ease you into things.   There may be quite a few Lexus in the parking lot, but there won't be too many Hummers.
other One of the best craft brew retailers in the NW valley.  While the Camelback store has an even more impressive selection as well as seasonal sells on certain items, this location also has a pretty solid catalog on hand.  I've noticed how the craft brew selection has expanded over the years.  I used to be one of the only guys in the aisle and now I have to pull rank and push guys out of the way who are day dreaming for too long.  I would love to open my own chain and only sell craft brew.  I'd name it Total Craft and Nothing more.
other What happened to my sunday love the Orange Table? First off I have been going to this restaurant for sunday brunch forever (they have delicious mimosa's). However recently a friend of mine and I decided to grab some quick and yummy dinner here. The portions of the appetizers they are now serving to their patrons is just sad. The brie app I so love at this place was enough for two bites per person,which i assume they thought was ok because they cut up like two apples for us. If i were interested in cut up apple for an app i would have stayed home and eaten one, not gone to a restaurant and payed $10.00. The rest of the meal was just mediocre  to say the least, for a restaurant that only serves sandwiches you would think they would be absolutely incredible. The service that night was pathetic the staff there seemed less than eager to be working for Orange table. Will not be in a hurry to get back, especially when next door AZ88 has delicious food and the staff are happy and upbeat!!
other I LOVE the pretzels! Wish they would bring back the Asiago Dip, but hey, garlic salt and cabs are other of my main food groups. Great atmosphere, can always see a game on one of the many TVs, even when my girlfriend thinks I'm paying attention to her! Milk stout is my favorite beer, but the light isn't bad either. Something tells me the others are good too, but it's hard to get me to stray from my patterns. Oh well, I'll leave someone else to review those. All in all, the food and beer is great, and the servers seem to know what they're doing too.
other I personally will never eat there again.The chips are actually amazing though, I would eat those a lot if it didnt require me stpping foot in the ultimate bro/slut restaurant.The food is gross, the tortillas are ok, I like the decor actually, but the employees are slutty (and by slutty I saw skirts soo short if they picked something off the floor you for sure would see vagina)Apparently the uniform is jean skirts and heels.This is the male glittery shirt wearing capitol of Scottsdale. The food sucks, dont eat here!
3 We had our first experience on a Friday night about 6:30. The servers were pleasant.  Wild Thaiger has a nice patio dining facing Central, but it was a little too hot and they didn't have a misting system. The inside was clean with a combo bar and open kitchen. We started with the Freshie Rolls with warm Peanut Sauce and Lychee Martini. Nice, but not the best in town (Pure Sushi Bar has a to die for Lychee Lemon Drop).  The entrees are huge and could easily be shared. We had the Kimow - hot and spicy clear noodles, chicken, broccoli, snow peas, sweet onion, Thai chili, garlic and sweet Thai Basil - Delicious!To be fair, Thai is not one of my favorites, but we love to support local restaurants and this came highly recommended. Glad we tried it. And for those of you who like it HOT and SPICY - Wild Thaiger has you covered.
other This is what I love about Phoenix, you find these little treasures where you expect them the least!Loved everything about the place. We had a team dinner in one of the rooms and it really felt like we were having dinner in someone's dining room. Super cute atmosphere, loved the pictures from all over Europe. I has the vegetarian rellenos (sp?) and my mouth is still watering just thinking about it. We also had the only malbec they have by the bottle and it was delicious!!
other A great experience every time we make it here.  Where else can you slide into the dining room?  We always have large groups and they are very accomodating, every table we've been at affords a beautiful view at sunset.  They try to make it a complete experience.Servers are always very helpful and attentive.  Steaks are good and the sides are good if not very inventive.   The birthday dessert and cotton candy really cap off the dinners.
other I was surprised by the depth and distinctness of the olive oil.  I was expecting oiliness with hints of flavor, but instead was pleasantly surprised by bold flavors carried on an already flavorful oil.  This place far outshines other oil stores which add flavor essence to their oil.  They infuse the flavors here, making them stronger and more authentic.Overall, great oil and balsamic vinegar.  Try their food, such as the sandwiches.  And definitely try as many oil samples as you can.  The oil is not too expensive, ~$20 per bottle.  Well worth it if you like to use it on bread or to add some great flavor to a salad.
other The pho is delicious, and the prices are fantastic.  Definitely a hole in the wall and very authentic (not much English spoken here).  Down side is that they don't serve beer (wha?! who doesn't drink beer with their pho?!) but otherwise other enthusiastic thumbs up.  Will come here whenever we're on this side of town.
other The Breakfast Club is as good as you'll find. The blueberry pancakes are superb, their coffee is beyond description. For a change of pace, try their Eggs Benedict, Southwestern style. A GREAT spot within walking distance...a beauty.
3 Had lunch here today after hearing all the colossal raves about it. However, once I walked in, I realized that any semblance of having an authentic Chinese meal went out the window (no offense, my hungry white friends!). I decided to try it out anyway, was seated by a friendly waiter and ordered the hot & sour soup (they were able to sub in chicken instead of pork - bonus) and the waiter recommended the house chicken to me. I asked for it to be made really spicy, knowing full well it wasn't going to be (no one EVER listens to me when I demand the food be spicy - listen, dammit, I'm brown, people). Anyway, that's my issue.The hot & sour soup arrived, and it was excellent. I was happy. Nothing mars a Chinese meal more than beginning it with a bowl of shiteous soup. Then came the house chicken (with string beans added for $1). Steamed rice costs another extra buck - I get annoyed when Chinese restaurants don't make it complimentary, but again, my issue. Anyway, the chicken was just ok. Nothing amazing and it still ended up feeling pretty heavy. So that dish I'm more willing to give it 2.other stars. So why did I bump up the star wattage? I guess the service. The waiter:* noticed I wasn't devouring my dish and offered to switch it for any other dish of my choice, no extra charge. Who does this nowadays - in a Chinese restaurant no less? Extra star.* is from the SF Bay Area like myself, so he gave me the lowdown for good Asian food in Phoenix (for dimsum he recommended Golden Buddha first, Great Wall second, C-Fu third - then for Vietnamese he recommended some place on 19th Ave between Indian School & Camelback.) He agreed that Thai, Korean, and sushi in Phoenix is kind of a letdown compared to California, but almost all the Asian restaurants (he admitted, including China Chili) cater to their core customers, who by sheer demographics are pretty much not Asian. That said, he told me that China Chili is THE place people go to for Chinese food, including Chris Bianco (of Pizzeria Bianco), the mayor, folks from Channel 10 news, the owner of the Diamondbacks, etc. etc. So take that for what you will.* When I asked if this China Chili was affiliated with..."oh, the one in Fremont? No. But people say that place is good and fancy and has an electric piano." Bonus points for knowing that.Anyway, he recommended I come back and get the Mongolian beef next time, which I'll definitely do, plus the hot & sour soup. I didn't mind the big open seating area - many Chinese restaurants in SF are like this, loud and raucous. All in all, China Chili is a case where service overcame the food (again, how often does that happen?) to come back and give it another shot. And there you have it.
other I've been here twice, great decor, cute & really friendly staff, and lots of really nice people to shoot the bull with. I've heard the food is really good too, but haven't tried much of it yet. I did try the french fry basket, it was nice and huge, and the hot wings are good, they use Franks, so if you like reg hot, get the hot. Happy hour specials are a good value too. Will return often.
other I really like this store.  The customer service is great.  I wish it weren't so expensive but I guess you get what you pay for.
other Alright this is the deal of deals, 2.7other for students and Im not sure if its a quarter more or not, but less other dollars. half an ice cream cookie sandwiches, trust me its enough.  Its a great pick me up for something sweet on millCookies are made their along with the good ice cream, and if your not into that they have italian ice.Place is small, but is packed with flavor, and smells like fresh cookies.Recommendation: If you love cookies made into sandwiches
other Reddddddd Robin.....Yum.Whiskey River BBQ burger is really all I get here so i cant speak to any other thing.  Its just hard to stray away from that good of a burger.When I was here most recently, I ordered the sweet potato fries instead of the normal fries....they were great...however they dont have a sauce for them and there is also no brown suger or anything on them to take them to the next level...so you end up with good fries that get bland after about 5. :(  comeon Red Robin, develop a sauce to go with those fries.As always, the staff was very friendly and attentetive.  I always seem to get good service here.
other I am not religious, but I will be the first person to admit I thank God for this place--and the neighboring Windsor. Seriously... a latte, ice cream on a waffle cone and a cocktail all within feet of each other. Dear Lord, I have reached bliss. I can die happy now.Some people gripe that the flavors are not strong enough. I prefer to gripe that they aren't open 24/7 because this is my bliss and damn it... I need it at all hours.Always friendly.Always clean.Always awesome.Yes, there is heaven.
other Nearly half a decade ago, a man's fantasy became reality in a form never seen before: Scottsdale, Arizona. The motivation for overhauling the city's master plan was to create the greatest feast for the senses in the American Southwest. Everyday, reputations are on the line as master chefs pit their artistic creations against each other.If my memory serves me correctly, and I think it does, the French first colonized Indochine in hopes of seeking access to rubber. And the greatest beneficiary of this decision would be the brothers Andre and Edouard Michelin, inventors of the world's first removable pneumatic tire. To encourage automobile sales, and by extension, their tires, the Michelin Company begin to print free travel guides at the turn of the century with recommendations and ratings systems for restaurants, hotels, and attractions throughout France. These ratings are still the most influential culinary grades in the Western world. It should come as no surprise that as controversy about the Michelin system has grown, Vietnamese cuisine has finally seen the rubber hit the road.A recent addition to Scottsdale's culinary universe is Andre Nguyen. Having migrated to America near the end of Republican Vietnam. Arriving in Seattle, Nguyen attended culinary school and met his wife, Noel. But despite the lure of of other cuisines, the chef stayed true to his roots and opened Andre's Eurasian Bistro in the suburb of Bellevue. His success was almost derailed by a fire that gutted the place. Ngyuen however used the time as a sabbatical, improving his craft, and re-opened his restaurant. Local journalists likened it to the Greek mythological creature of rebirth , the phoenix.But as luck would have it, he and his wife sought out to leave soggy Seattle for arid Arizona for a different Phoenix. At the end of 2005, they took over a hole-in-the-wall called Pho AZ and named it "Noodles Ranch". Here today, Chef Andre rules the roost with impressive skill.The interior decor flatters the otherwise mundane feel of the strip mall in which it sits. Andre has been careful to use color and light to accent various pictures, newspaper clippings and other decorations. But what will surprise the visitor is the degree in which Andre takes this so seriously as to neglect not even the bathroom from this regime.His menu is a mix of predictable, authentic Vietnamese dishes and his own creations borrowed from other cuisines or his own imagination. Chef Andre is not a reckless auteur, but his more audacious dishes may have fewer fans than his bread and butter. As the Chef takes many of the orders personally, guests often might assume the service to be poor, undercut by Andre's own seemingly curt personality. But this ignores the fact that in authentic Asian restaurants, servers often seem more distant and unpleasant than Denny's. Do not let Andre's intent become lost in translation.Finally, in standing with his other bretheren, the Chef achieves this all with low prices. Now Chef Andre, "the Giant", after years of success in the land of gray skies face your greatest challenge yet. Hold your own against the city's most eminent gourmands, not just for you but for the good of all Scottsdale.
3 it's an Imax theater, so unless you haven't been to one then it you know it is an oversized screen with wider shots and better sound. The location itself looks dated and in need of some repair, perhaps just some paint. The viewing experience was great and I will go back if there is another flick being shown that I must see in IMAX, but the fact remains the Mall, the Theater and much of the area looks dated.
other Here's how to do Pizzeria Bianco the right way:1. Show up at 3:30 or earlier to get a good place in line. Make sure you bring some friends to enjoy the time together and the great food.2. At 4:00, the bar opens. Get yourself a bottle of wine and make the best of the 90 minutes you'll spend just waiting to get on the seating list.3. Order a few appetizers from the bar; they're light and fresh and yummy.4. When you finally get seated for dinner, don't hold back. Order salads, share different pizzas, and have a coffee after.The quality of the food is ABSOLUTELY worth the wait. We tried eating here a few times over the past couple of years, but realized it takes commitment and two bottles of wine to make it through the line. Best pizza I've had since Italy. Bravo Bianco!
3 I went here due to a Restaurant.com coupon. The menu was expensive, which made me think that it was a fancy place, but it turns out that the food was expensive because it was a restaurant inside a hotel! It was inside the Sheraton and I didn't see any signs outside indicating it was there. We'd made reservations since it was a Friday night, but they really weren't necessary, as there were only two other families in the restaurant. We'd dressed up. We were the only ones.The restaurant area was really very modern beautiful. They'd made good use of lighting effects and there was a large, full bar wrapped along the back portion.We ordered the Pan-Seared Cheese (which were basically fried cheese poppers - delicious, but definitely overpriced considering only other of them came on a plate) as an appetizer. My date ordered the Baron's Burger (your basic burger), and I ordered the Valley of the Sun Ribs. The ribs were a little dry, but I really loved the "Arizona croquette" that came with them. It was fried crispy on the outside with creamy mashed potatoes on the inside.With the restaurant.com coupon, the meal was reasonably priced, but without it, I would have felt a little ripped off.
other LOVE this place.  The parking is terrible.  That's what keeps me from being a regular. Coffee and deserts are SUPERB.  Atmosphere is A+. Love the gifts.
3 They don't have the lunch specials on the menu or tell you about them if you don't ask, so make sure to ask. The sandwiches don't come with fries and their fries are over priced for not being very good. The pulled pork sandwich is good and so is the sauce. Also, expect a long wait especially if people are ahead of you.
other We just tried this out this afternoon following lunch at Pita Jungle next door.   It's a self-service yogurt shop where you pay by the ounce once you've finished your creation.  The offerings included the standard vanilla and chocolate, but also less traditional offerings like Irish Mint and Red Velvet were also available.  They offer a taste of any of the products, and you can mix multiple types of yogurts in your container.  They also offer a variety of standard yogurt shop toppings for your creation.I had a combination of the Irish Mint and Latte yogurts, with a couple of toppings.  The yogurt itself was smooth, creamy and well flavored.We'll likely be dropping by here in the future.
other Tucked on the western edge of the Foothill Acres neighborhood in North Phoenix or what I would call "The Slope", Try Me Bicycle Shop has been in business for nearly 40 years and has been collecting the odd part for every type of bike over that time. The showroom is filled with cruisers and comfort bikes, new and used. No high end bikes here but they do have an inventory of old and hard-to-find parts, good service and free air that makes this place.
other Great work lunch. Valet parking, only. Waitress was helpful in narrowing down my selection (salmon salad) and listened to my criteria. other stars since wait staff seemed otherwise aloof.
3 I was looking for chile rellenos and this place does a great job of making them just the way I like it.  Flavorful and not dry.   Also had the chips and salsa which I did not think were anything special and you have to order them unlike most Mexican places where it is expected at the time they serve the drinks.  Flan was unimpressive.  I think I will go back for the chile rellenos and head down the street to Carlsbad Tavern for the flan (theirs is my favorite).
other Huh. I guess it's a love it or hate kind of place. Me? I love it. But put butter on a shoe and I might just kiss you. Oh butter, is there anything you can't do? Is there?This is one of the high roller places in Scottsdale. I saw a guy take a wad of Benjis out of his pocket that seriously made me consider rolling him. But my boss might have objected. Damn boss.It's all about service and steak here. And I'm down with that. We had crab legs for an appetizer. Quite nice for a land-locked state. Fresh and tasty. A tomato salad with sharp onion that I enjoyed. And shared a porterhouse the size of my... yes. My ass. If one could give a nice slap to a porterhouse, this would be quite a spankable piece of meat. I love the way you can hear your steak coming to your table in all it's sizzling glory. The first thing to hit your nose is the lovely perfume of the butter. Chanel # Yum. Then that aroma of the meat. I know we had a couple of sides. But I honestly can't remember because the steak was so freaking perfect. To a corn-fed born and bred midwestern girl this is perfection. The service is near perfect too. Our waitress gave us a wine selection for the steak that was spot on. Not too tanic. Not too tame. Held up nicely against the butter and the porterhouse. At the end of the meal I was I nearly unable to move. And that says a whole lot. I've been known to out eat grown men without batting an eye. Oh, and if you don't like butter on your steak? Three words. "Hold the butter." May save you some pain.
other Maybe their dogs are better, but breakfast sandwiches at Nathan's are disgusting! The English muffin was spongy, the eggs greasy, the bacon undercooked... And all premade and wrapped ready to melt together into mush with the cheese. Yuck!!!
other Three stellar write-ups pushed me over the edge and I decided that it was time to take my self for a much needed pedi. When I arrived, the place was packed, but thankfully they gladly take walk-ins and I had only a brief wait before I was whisked away to my massaging, bubbling chair of goodness.I have to echo the other reviewer's comments on cleanliness and down-right bargain for the service provided. Not once did I have that "eww, you aren't actually going to touch me with that" reaction. I didn't swoon from toxic vapors as soon as opening the door. And my attendant was super friendly and completely cool with the fact that I had clearly neglected my heals for the last two months (something that was hugely apparent after she started filing away - how mortifying... skin flying everywhere!!!)And for those of you that might fear the Elaine experience (Seinfeld reference), fret not. You can actually understand everyone one that works here and shouldn't find yourself sitting and wondering "what in the hell are they saying about me now?"Take your twenty-bucks (plus a little extra for tip - unless you get flowers you will need thirty) and go get some much deserved pampering. Dear Paulene - my toes and heals thank you for the love! -- see pic ; )
other Located in the W Hotel in Scottsdale.  Great sushi dishes and a great atmosphere.  I've only been there once but the service was great and the food was very taste and fresh.
other yumtastic!! just don't forget your safety whistle and pepper spray! ....even during the day....
other I always forget and tell people that Pomeroy's is on Central. I think it must just be that cool - I'm trying to pull it closer to the other really good places to go. It is, in fact, on 7th St. and if you tie it on a little tight, the grocery behind is, in fact, open late. It looks like a bar that should have a few regular bar flies and music that screeches to a halt when someone new walks in. And by that, I mean it's the most endearingly divey of bars.There's shuffleboard, just give your id to the bartender in return for the pucks. There's pool, but you pay quarters for that. The juke box is electronic and you should expect that you're gonna hear Def Leppard at least once during the night. The regulars will help you learn darts, the food is griddle-fare and the guys behind the bar are always good for a chat or to grab you a pint. Pomeroy's should definitely be on your rotation of places to be in Phoenix.
other As a sissy vegetarian, I feel compelled to mention the soup that no one has yet mentioned at Da Vang - THE TAMARIND BASED SOUP HOT POT IS AMAZING!I don't know if they use any other animal broth in it, because I am willfully ignorant of such matters.  Regardless, if you are a meat eater or a vegetarian, try the tamarind soup, and bring friends.  It is super yummy.They also have a rice-based soup.  And, if you talk to your server, they can likely recommend some vegetarian/tofu based dishes that will be wonderful.Everything else is as good as everyone says it is.  Wouldn't be surprised if people got an occasional bowl of sub-par pho; every family restaurant makes mistakes.  I'd recommend everyone try it again.
other I need to stop going here so much, but it's hard to stay away.
other love love love this place for a second i don't feel like i'm in fakville anymore.  Live music and a diverse crowd.  They make a great infused berry tea smoothie no dairy just juice and ice!  Parking is great and the selection of food is appropriate and divine for a cafe.  Very comfortable and not to image conscious inside!  Love that it's independent and staff is so lovely.  I would pay $10 for a latte just to support them!  Punch card too!
other I can't remember the name of the special salad we had tonight with Shrimp, but I will never forget the taste.  FABULOUS is an understatement!  The NY pizza was equally as great.  Every time I come here I say to myself, we need to come more often.  Everything is always good.Diane was our server tonight.  What a cutie!  More important is that the service was excellent!  Diane was back at our table many times checking to see if there was anything else she could do for us.  Another comment I want to make is there was a young man taking care of the table.  At some point I thanked him and was surprised to receive "Your more than welcome", instead of the typical "No Problem" statement coming from young people.  I should have gone to the management to tell them I was impressed by him, his smile and mannerisms.We will be back!
other Found the Tuck Shop on my Urban Spoon AP and what a grand surprise it ended up being!  In the heart of Coronado this little house has been transformed to a true Phoenix jewel!The food was amazing..we had pork with a pasta and broccoli.  The pork had two amazing sauces that my boyfriend I argued over which was the better.  The pasta was okay a bit of a cumin flavor but great once we mixed it with the pork's sauce.  The broccoli was a great fresh touch.  The manager came over and spent some time talking to us more about the menu and plans to open another place with a different menu soon.  A must try if you are a down town kinda person!  The crowd  was a mix of tshirts casual to formal and the patrons ages ranged just as much.  The menu changes with the season so go check it out!  Only complaint I've heard from people I've recommended was the lack of choice if you are a vegetarian.
other Love this place!  Went for a stay-cation with the girls for a spa day and stayed the night.  I can't wait to go back!  You are in the city but feels miles away!  The spa is amazing!  Wonderful adults only pool with great refreshing food and drinks.  Then our rooms were clean and comfortable.  Dinner at Kai was nothing short of superb, and breakfast the next morning on the patio over looking the golf course and pool area was also very good.  Overall a wonderful night away.
other Best TexMex in the valley! The chips and salsa are home made and probably the best I have ever eaten. I had shrimp tacos which were delicious, staff was very friendly and down to earth.....if you ate downtown give them a try.
other I have read several raving reviews of this place.  I was disappointed the first time so I went back again thinking I had an off experience.  I was still disappointed.  I had the carne torta the first time and the cubana the second.  The food was okay.  Not bad but not filling and not as good as some other places I can name off the top of my head.  The first time the torta came with chips and the 2nd time they came alone.  For 6 or 7 bucks Id expect a little more.  Here are a few places with much better tortas: Los Reyes De La Torta (7th st & Hatcher), El Gallo Blanco (Central & Indian), and El Nopalito (24th st and Thomas).
other Loved my haircut. Walked in and waited for just a minute. The stylist cut exactly like I wanted and I walked out paying 20 which included the tip.
other We recently took a weekend getaway to Phoenix and stayed here. The Hotel is beautiful and our rooms were spacious and very comfortable. The staff here are topnotch. I love the lobby wine & hot apple cider hour in the afternoons, and the lobby coffee & hot chocolate bars in the mornings. We had access to the Golds Gym across from the hotel and were able to get a good workout in their cardio theatre. There is an outdoor skating rink right outside and a small shopping/dining area. It is located right across from the stadium and could walk to our event. I would definitely recommend staying here, especially if you are attending an event at the arena.
other This is a new neighborhood breakfast joint in a building many think is "cursed".  The turnover for businesses at this location is high.  But I think Oink is going to make it!  They were very busy when we were there so it took a little bit to get refills on coffee (need bigger cups) and the food took a couple minutes longer, but no worries.  Who I think is the owner was not just standing by and watching everyone else run around like chickens with their heads cut off, they were serving, clearing plates, filling coffee.  Love to see that!  The menu is decent.  I'm not a huge breakfast person but there were quite a few items on the menu I was interested in.  The funny thing is my hubby and I ended up not ordering any bacon and didn't realize this until after we finished eating!  So we definitely will be going back to try the bacon they are known for....jalapeno bacon anyone!
other I am one of those people that talk crap about Gordon Biersch behind its back but I'm nice to its face. I go there and continue having expensive yet mediocre meals, but like I just said- I go there. My boyfriend asked me once "why do it to yourself when you don't enjoy it? " I don't know. Maybe I'm a masochistic eater. Actually, I'm just very agreeable and I work super closeby. AND if I didn't go there I would just walk over to Whole foods and spend a zillion dollars on a goulash-y takeout container that I don't even like after I pay for it. For me, lunch is more about getting out and doing something else for an hour a day. If someone wants to go to GB I will happily tag along and probably eat, even though I know I wont like it. At least there's not much harm in that, except to my wallett! PS- Lori is the nicest, sweetest server/bartender ever and chatting with her makes up for the crappy food!
3 The very definition of an average brunch.  My omelet was pretty decent, and it's nice that they let you choose a bunch of ingredients if you want to.  However the breakfast potatoes are extremely weak, fairly bland and underseasoned and are probably not hand cut and prepared.  They are mixed with an uninspiring blend of green peppers.   The rest of my table seemed to feel about as enthusiastic as I did about their breakfast burritos.The service was also pretty slow.  Despite the awesome patio and pretty good eye candy among the patronage here, this place is definitely one you can skip.
other This is the most progressive, inclusive, welcoming, diverse, intellectually stimulating, public-service oriented church in the Valley, if not the West Coast.  We've been to more than a few and can attest to that.  Pastor Jeff not only knows everyone's name but is genuinely concerned about everything that goes on in your life.  The congregation is like one big family.  Love for your neighbors is not just a commandment at this church - it's acted upon.  If you're sick of churches that tell you what to believe in and don't act what they preach, you'd better check this one out.  Services every Sunday at 9:30am.
other This is a beautiful store. Its huge and spacious. The workers are friendly and helpful. You can't go wrong with cute, nerdy boys who help you fix things! :]
3 Must have eaten here a dozen times (used to work next door a few years ago). Nothing to amazing on the menu, the food is good overall but nothing I can remember really stood out. The best thing about the place is the location.I have noticed it has gotten considerably busier here as of late, maybe things are improving.They do offer Free Wifi which gets them some extra credit.*I have just been informed that new management has taken drastic steps to improve the place - I will visit and update this review ASAP
other I really like Bandera.  I really LOVE their cornbread.  Best dang cornbread I've ever had.  I dream about it in fact.  Food is always great, service is usually great as well.  Great place to take guests if you're not sure what they like.My only complaint...Bandera is a fairly casual restaurant, yet last time I was there my father was asked to remove his cap.  No biggie, he willingly obliged, but then I noticed the staff didn't seem to have a problem with the cute little thing wearing hers at the next table.  Come on, be consistent guys.
other This place is the perfect example of a tourist trap.  Nice location not far of the main drag of Old Scottsdale, beautiful building and layout.  The margaritas are good, but probably $2-$3 more expensive than they ought to be for every one of the many styles.  I thought paying $other for chips and salsa was a rip-off, but then when the chips tasted stale, I was even less happy.  C'mon, if you have tortilla and factory in your name, you ought to have fresh chips.  I thought the tortillas themselves were okay, not great, but okay.  The carne fuego, or whatever I had the waitress recommended, was not good.  Small chunks of fire roasted steak completely ruined by a gloppy sweet/hot sauce. The veggies that went with it were just okay and the sweet potato-stuffed chile was weird.  It could've been great, but it was nowhere near good.  Unless your Aunt Hattie who has never had Mexican food is in town from Ohio, i'd skip this place altogether.
other dropped by for lunch with 90yr old and other yr old plus hubby. all in all very good. hubby had sausage samich w/fries he really enjoyed it. baby had spaghetti and meatball she ate real good which means it was real good. mom had catfish w/spaghetti and marinara, she ate more than half and the rest went home with her. i had chicken marsala w/marinara on ziti. i subbed the wedding soup for the salad. the service was very quick and attentive. the lamb appetizer was just right with the bread. everything was tasty and very nice presentation. will be back soon, very convenient, very reasonable prices plus a full bar for happy hour.pizza looked very promising, too. take out may also be in my future relationship with lil deemo's.

other We'd heard that this place was really tasty, but learned that the original location had shut down recently.  We found their second location and gave it a try.It ended up being so good that we went twice in one week while visiting the area. We had a chicken quesadilla both times and on one trip added a large nachos with chicken.  Great flavor, good-sized portions, good value.Would have been a 5-star rating had our server not forgotten our drinks and had the restaurant been cleaner during our first visit.  We were directed to sit anywhere we liked, but it took us a while to find a clean table even though there were only two other tables occupied.
3 Last night after developing a huge craving for Panang Chicken and browsing Yelp for a good place nearby, I decided to call Papaya. The guy who answered the phone said that due to a downed gas line in the area they couldn't operate, but their Mesa store would deliver to me for no extra charge since I couldn't come pick it up like I wanted to. I said this would be fine, placed my order, and the guy said it would be about 4other minutes. An hour and 1other minutes later the food still hadn't arrived, but I figured it was just because it was coming from Mesa. When it finally arrived, I was starving, so I opened the food immediately, only to find out that my Panang CHICKEN was nothing but sauce and a few carrots and bell peppers. On top of this, I had been charged a delivery fee when they said I wouldn't, and I was charged for chicken when I got none. I called back immediately to tell them my food did not have any chicken in it, but was only sauce and a couple vegetables. They informed me that they were very busy and would not be able to bring me another order that night, but I could call back the next day (today) and they would bring me another order. I was upset and hoped that for all the trouble the food was at least good. Well, it was. The panang sauce was very delicious and perfectly spicy. Although it was not made the way I ordered it, I could still tell that it was very good and I would definitely order it again. Today, I called back and they brought me a new order, this time of Spicy Eggplant with chicken since I had already had to eat the panang I ended up with last night and didn't want that again at this point. They were very nice about making it right, and they delivered it to me again at no charge and credited back the charge they made last night. Delivery took about an hour and 1other minutes again even though he had said 4other and this location is about a mile from where I live, so if you order delivery expect a bit of a wait. As for the Spicy Eggplant with chicken, it was REALLY delicious. The eggplant tasted like some of the best I've ever had, not mushy but not firm, and I finally got my chicken and yes, it was very good. SO in conclusion, the food is great but I hope that they are more organized when they aren't having technical difficulties. Probably won't have them deliver again but I would definitely order from here again. If there hadn't been all the problems I would give them other stars but the fact that I couldn't even get my order corrected that night was upsetting.
other Three-star service, but five-star ambience=four estrellas. Let's face it, marina restaurants don't have to push too hard to succeed. Competition along the shoreline is minimal. When the cooler runs low on the boat, Lakeside Restaurant is the only show in town. You can tie up at the little restaurant dock, where the sign warns of a 30 minute limit, which is laughable given the snail-paced service. Sit on the patio and toss a few crumbs to the waiting ducks and, further down the food chain, the circling iridescent big-mouth carp. Feathered, scaled, and furry scavengers vie for patio scraps. The water is clear and calm, and the view stunning. The coffee is weak and watery, if plentiful, and the omelettes are big and fluffy, if bland. The heavily inked wait staff is polite if a little rough around the edges, but props to folks who are sturdy enough tackle a full-time wilderness gig like this. Note: these are the best restrooms within 20 miles.
other It saddens me to say that this isn't the worst Mexican restaurant we've eaten at, that's on Oahu near Waikiki beach, but it's close.  Damn it we had to drive by Arriba's to get to this place.   I had a chimichanga that was a little anemic, though what there was of the filling was ok,  beans  tasteless, rice looked the part but as spicy as your average UK meal involving boiled meat and root vegetables. Erin's Fajita salad was similarly lack luster  with  all the appearance of being tasty yet   bland chicken. Usually, unless there's an attempt at "chefing" as opposed to cooking  I'll order a basic dish ( I don't shoot the chef though  and trust me these guys are safe from Agent Sands , very safe)  for the first time out  and if the beans/rice suck.. no return.Overall It feels like aliens, space ones, are running the place and they learned cooking from pictures.  It's certainly a mistake we won't be repeating.
other This place defies being stuck in a single category. Their menu is a bit eclectic and my only regret is not getting to try more of it.This place was right around the corner from my hotel on a recent business trip. We liked it so much, we ate here a couple of times. I'm sorry Alex P. felt that he was getting attitude. One of my coworkers asked if he could have the daily special from the previous day because he had liked it so much. They told him it wouldn't be a problem and fixed it right up for him. The food was good and reasonably priced. I was there in April and enjoyed getting to sit outside on their patio and enjoy the awesome weather.
other I was skeptical when I kept hearing how amazing Jimmy John's is.  So I went in, and found my new favorite sandwich spot!  The inside was very noisey, but I liked the atmosphere.  The bread had an awesome fresh taste, and when I inquired about the difference between other sandwiches, the cashier was very helpful.
other My best friend and I found this place via yelp after a horrendous experience at Mimi's Cafe... so happy we did! Food is great and everyone is so friendly. You can eat out on the patio with shaded tables, or you can eat inside while they play great music (we were dancing to James Brown while ordering our food). It'll be our new breakfast spot from now on!
other LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!  always need to find a reason to drive so far to Chandler:-)  so fresh, soup delish, and sauces yummy!!! BYOB, and casual...feels like my grandmas:-)
3 Went here because of a groupon, will probably not go back without one.  Cons:Overpriced, flat out.  Plus, like other reviewers have said, they RUN OUT of a lot of good stuff.  Also, I know this is something small, but as their menu changes, they should update it online.  Had I known the menu would be so different, I would have waited for another week to get a meal I would ACTUALLY want (as opposed to settling).  Also, we had reservations and had to wait 20 minutes.  Not a huge deal, but a personal pet peeve.Pros:  The food was good, but like I said, overpriced.  Since I had a deal, I didn't mind as much.  Atmosphere is nice, and I loved the extras (we got a few small tasting, palate cleansers?).  The cotton candy was fab, and though the strawberry dessert was NOT my first choice, it was truly delicious, and I may go back JUST for that dish!  I love the location, and the staff was incredibly friendly, informative, and courteous.  Knock down the prices and I'd give it at least other stars!
other I spent most of my first year being legal drinking age at this wild, college bar. It was fun then, but I got older, it wore on me. It's a big ASU bar and there's no escaping the drunk college kids. The guys can usually be found on the patio barking lame pick up lines at the female passerbys and the ladies are usually grinding it up on the small dance floor on the weekend nights.With the summer heat, Fat Tuesdays frozen drinks are appreciated. But if you don't want to drink them with the college crowd, hit the bar during the day or early evenings.
other Went there for the first time today.  Excellent burger, and all the extra's on the burger are free which is pretty nice.  It was just over 10 bucks for a cheeseburger, regular fries, and large drink. The food was excellent.  I ding it down to other stars though, just because anything this good has to be unhealthy, and its definitely greasy.   The grease from the fries saturday my brown paper take-out bag.  They also squished the top of my bun pretty bad when wrapping it up in tin foil.  I'm guessing if you eat there, you don't have this problem as much.  Still, other stars for an excellent burger and fries place.  Definitely a step up over In-N-Out.
other My favorite place for fish fry. They perfectly pour pints of Guinness, too.The ginormous chunks of cod with a crispy, light-to-medium batter is very tasty. I prefer it with the scalloped potatoes but you don't get a choice during Friday all-you-can-eat.It's a small-to-medium sized pub with a nice scotch and whiskey menu. I had my first Tullamore Dew here and it didn't disappoint. It's a bit dark and some of the tables are wine barrels - makes comfortable sitting a bit of a challenge. The live bands I've heard were great and can be pretty loud. A couple of TVs dot the bar with all things football (soccer) and American football (if you're a Jets fan).Service is friendly and only a couple of times it wasn't very prompt.It definitely has a bit of character to it and I wish I had more time to stop by there.
other If you want a school that cares more about your financial aid money than you, this is the school for you. Education is horrible. If you are a democrat, don't speak your mind; you will be considered a reject from day one. I got 100% on my graduate papers and think I did not contribute anything to the fields. This institution is a joke.
other Waitress/ bartenders are cute. We didnt eat. We just got a drink and left. Only like other beers on tap but no worries. They even gave one of my friends a band-aid lol. Their mix drink prices are a bit outrageous tho.. 3 beers for 10 or so.. 1other alone for a double of jack and coke.
other This is my favorite place locally here in Phoenix, absolutely great coffee! Next to central highschool and light rail so there can be traffic when school let's out or rush hour.
other Mostly I love the Rokerij just because I love saying the name.  But the food is also killer.  I had the most amazing chicken, and the sides, which usually I just take for granted as filler food, were sodelicious that they caught my attention in a big way.  I also tried my date's steak, and while it was fairly spendy, it sure seemed worth it.The feel of the place is great too, with the dark stone walls and coziness without feeling too crowded.  We ventured downstairs to look at the bar, and had we been there early enough to snag a couch I wouldn't have wanted to leave.It definitely feels like a splurge, or somewhere you'd take a business associate or date that you wanted to wow.  It's manages a high end feel, while remaining unmistakably local.  I can't say I'd suggest it just for any old night, but it will stay on top of my list for special occasions.
other Thomas was very welcoming and a great server/bartender. Came in close to close and still gave us ample time to enjoy our late night date. My lady and i's date night are few and far between so to be able to have a experience like tonight is very appreciated. Kudos Thomas and citizen!
other I went here with a party of 6 on Saturday night.  Our table was ready and waiting when we got there which was nice.  It is an older place with tons of charm.  The place was pretty busy and you could tell that the waiters/servers/busers were clearly over worked.After sitting for about 10 minutes we had to flag someone down to get bread and place our appetizer order.  After that we only saw our waiter every 20 minutes or so so it was difficult to order additional items or to get soda refills.The service was pretty blah but the food was excellent.  Everything I tried was top notch.  Everything was freshly made and delicious  Probably some of the best Italian cuisine around.  Definitely some of the best gnocchi I've ever had.I would definitely return but hope the service is better.
other Went to Yogurt Kingdom for the first time tonight.  It was perfect.  Lots of flavors to choose from.  My favorite is the Tart Vanilla.  But I got a large cup and tasted at least 8 different flavors and I enjoyed each and everyone.  I wanted to go back and get some more of the Tart Vanilla but my husband gave me one of those looks when I suggested it.  You can either eat inside or outside.  The place is decorated so cute.   There was a very cute and well mannered girl to greet us and told us how it all worked just in case we had not been there before.   They offered to give us any samples that we might like to try.  There was a gentleman there who turned out to be the owner.  He was very kind, friendly person  and glad that we stopped in.   The bathroom was very clean and the entire place was tidy and well maintained.   We will be back very soon.  I would recommend this place to others that like yogurt.  You won't be disappointed.
3 Wowza!  This place is a total trip!  No, I don't smoke, but if I did this place is probably the place I would go to.  First off, the food was okay.  I ordered some chicken wings, which wasn't really that great.  My favorite was the Thai Curry -- it definitely had some pop to it.  It's one of those that creep up on you.  Milk please!  My friend ordered some Sake that I thought was real good and smooth -- don't ask me what it was, the lighting was low and I didn't care much by the time I arrived.Service was pretty good I guess, and then again the place was drop dead for a Friday night.  What's up with that!?  I'm sure the place gets hopping on 1st Friday, but that's only one day out of the month -- I sure it picks up quick!Ambience, was cool, just reminded me of the 70's in a way even though I didn't grow up during the 70's haha, but I thought the design and decor were pretty cool.  Eccentric I think was the word I used.  Bathroom was blue and that's all I'll say.......check it out! - Enjoy!
other I'm so glad that there is at least one Asian grocery store in the valley. Unfortunately they seem to have a hard time keeping some of my favorite items in stock, I wonder if this is a result of some of the import restrictions/delays that have been a result of the recent quality issues with food and toys imported from China.I'm half Chinese and spent much of my youth being dragged around Chinatown near L.A. by my grandmother and 6 or 7 aunts. So the 99 Ranch Market brings back memories...some fond...some not quite so. But, at any rate, the prices are great and the selection is good and authentic (when it's in stock). The cashiers could use a little dosing from the friendly fairy, however. Then again, I don't remember many friendly cashiers or clerks at any of the stores I frequented as a kid...so I guess it just makes the experience all the more genuine for me.I would recommend going on a weekday, or, if you must go on the weekend, just avoid going around lunchtime. There's a dim sum restaurant in the same shopping center and the parking lot gets pretty jam packed with cars and pedestrians.
other Attended the Pink charity event at the Shade bar.  Great time and the scene was fantastic.Need to highlight the job that Jason and Halley do with VIP tables.  I've worked with both of them twice now and the experience is always top notch.  Always ensure that the experience is better than expected.
other My sister took me here last week its crazy that I haven't been yet right? This is her regular go to place. Not much I can say after so many reviews here already. The patio looked very nice I bet its the place to be when its cooler. It was kind of empty in here but it was late afternoon. My sis ordered us some Drunken Italian Sodas they were made super strong though usually this would not detour me however I had my child with me and had to drive all the way back home after. Basically it tasted like straight vodka in a giant glass it was a bit much for me mid day and after adding Sprite to it which I stole from my daughter I still couldn't drink it without feeling like I'd be a drunken Mexican after. I didn't understand this drink maybe someone can explain it to me? My sis told me their Sangria was good but I had no idea they made Caipirinha's next time that's what I get no question. The food: We had the garlic lemon hummus it was really good the ingredients separately didn't have much taste to them but together it was really nice the pita bread was excellent. The kid couldn't stop eating the hummus she got so full she barely touched her mac n cheese so we brought that home along w all the leftover hummus. Now on to the Tejano burger we decided to split. OMG it was so delicous I couldn't put it down and we both regretted having split it w each other. Extra star just for that burger alone you best try it if you haven't son!!!
other Recently bought a house and had issues with the speed and interference with the very many wifi networks around me.I decided to go wired so after I did a lot of research on how to get a wire from my second floor to first floor for the entertainment center. I bought a lot of tools from Fry's electronics and then after I started actually looking at what I had to do, I realized it would not be something I can do myself.I called good guys electric and they came over and ran a couple of wires using CAT6 instead of the CATother I would have used through the (nail-ridden) attic and through walls without any wires sticking out while they kept away from the electrical wires to prevent interference.I returned the tools and wire I got from Fry's electronics and that made the install very affordable.I'm very happy with the quality of my network speed now, being able to stream HD content from my server upstairs to the TV 200 feet away.After completing the network-wiring job, I had them install a new chandelier on a remote-controlled dimmer switch which was done quickly and works great
other Excellent selection of unusual but delicious pizzas.  my favorite so far include prosciutto pizza and the lamb pizza
other I enjoyed a pleasant lunch here with my carefree grandparents-in-law who recommended Tonto as a delicious place. When we first entered the I thought it might be full of retirees and rich Arizonians but I was pleasantly surprised to find a crowd of all sorts enjoying lunch on the outdoor patio overlooking a pretty view of the golf course and elegant Saguaros. Elegantly Casual American describes Tonto. Indeed it's pricey, but the food is fresh, creatively presented and delicious. (Extra pluses for using locally-sourced ingredients) I enjoyed the Mexican white shrimp tacos. The petite shrimp comes drenched in a sassy ancho chili green pepper sauce, complemented by a cool and zesty cabbage-carrot-cilanto slaw, avocado cream sauce and chewy homemade white corn tortillas. The fun is getting to assemble your own tacos. I ate nearly every bite and was stuffed for most of the day. My companions enjoyed the Reuben sandwich (layered corned beef on crispy rye, served with skinny fries that don't need ketchup) and the Halibut served on potato cake with spinach and carrot salad. Grandma-in-law said the halibut was tender and flavorful. I can imagine a bunch of friends or foodies mingling and laughing, sipping wine in relaxed delight as you drink in the beautiful view. Worth a visit, whether you're a local foodie or traveler.
other I highly reccomend this place. They helped my girlfriend and I figure out our taxes and deductions so that we could get the max refund. We both had been doing our taxes online and missing out on hundreds in deductions. Ill never use another online service to do my taxes again as long as these guys are here.
other I've been going to Jess @ Chace Salon for almost other years now and she is nothing short of amazing!!  Cut, color, highlights....she is my super stylist. :) If you are looking for someone to give you a new look, or just revamp a style you're already in love with, ask for her.
other Stop everything you're doing and go get one of their brownies, warmed up, with an ice cold glass of milk. I'll never be the same.
other I love this place. I sit in the bar and as one other reviewer noted, there is always someone interesting there to start up a conversation. The burgers are top dawg, the condiment bar allows me to fulfill my jalepeno quota, the wings are perfection, and the drinks are reasonable. When the weather is nice, grab a table outside. The service is a smidge slower, but the courtyard more than makes up for it. If the weather is warm settle in and enjoy whatever game they have playing (if you aren't seeing your team, just ask and they will happily turn at least one set for you).
other Pretty good food,  the selection was great the service was a bit slow and I had to seat my family my self but overall it was ok, all day every day 99 cent margaritas.
other Let me begin by telling you about my horribly debilitating fear of going to the dentist.  It's epic.  Weeks before an appointment I start having nightmares.  Thinking about sitting in the dental chair makes me break out in a cold sweat.  I require nitris oxide for a simple cleaning. The sound of the drill is enough to make me want to claw my face off.  Basically, every visit has been the worst experience ever for the past 30 years....Enter Dr. Marcia Blazer.  I read about her online when searching for a local dentist here in Scottsdale.  I literally googled "dentists for anxious patients", and her name popped up.  Her website appeared too good to be true.  They offered nitris (plus), offered non invasive options for dental procedures (double plus), and offered a staff used to accomodating those with a healthy dose of dental fear.I went in for my first visit (a cleaning and exam), and I was amazed at how comfortable they made me feel.  They were warm and friendly, and put me at ease immediately.  During the cleaning, my least favorite part is always when they use the scrapy,pointy torture device to stab off all the plaque at the gumline.  How happy was I when they used an air abrasion tool instead...felt like a cool stream of water on your teeth, and BAM, they're clean!  They were so calming, that when I was informed that I had other cavities, I didn't even have a panic attack at the thought of coming in.Fast forward two weeks to my filling appointment.  I had requested nitris (hey, I was feeling better but still SUPER anxious), which they had all set up in the room for me when I walked in.  Now here's my favorite part.  As I sat in the chair, the assistant brought over two big boxes full of dvd's and asked me what movie I would like to watch during the procedure...What?? So I picked a lighthearted comedy (50 First Dates).  I was then given noise eliminating headphones to use (goodbye horrible drilling sound), nitris (hello happy gas), and a few hand signals to recognize if I was supposed to open or close my mouth.  And we were off!  She didn't try to maintain conversation (soooo annoying when dentists do that), and before I knew it she was done and I was disappointed because my movie wasn't quite over!  I was even told that had my dentist not needed the room I was in for another patient, that I would have been welcome to stay and just finish the movie!I have had several interactions with this office since then (regarding billing and follow up), and every time it is a pleasure to deal with them.  I highly recommend this office to anyone!
other I like that we have a sports venue in the West Valley, I think that this place has tons of more potential but under the current recession it will take time to recover and get the growth we need all around this place.  I love that Cabelas is over here and other movie theaters nearby.  I enjoy the food options when we are in this area and sometimes drive out of my way to come here since Park West is also nearby on 10other & Northern.  We came here this weekend and the kids walked around with us and we enjoy all the fountains and the kid area where children can play in the water.
other I went to Khai Hoan yesterday and ordered the rare beef pho.  Now, this is the first time I have had pho before and I would say it is much like a glorified bowl of Ramen Noodles.  That said, it was good.  To me, not great, just good.  We got the combination appetizer plate.  The spring roll was amazing.  The crab was great.  I didn't like the "egg roll" as much as I thought I would, but it was definitely fresh.  I had fresh coconut juice to drink and it was delightful.  I would go back again for sure, but I would be ordering something other than the pho.
other This was the marriage of two of my favorite things alcohol and ice cream.  As Charlie Sheen would say "Winning!!!!"I had a groupon so Laura A. and I went to try out this amazing place.  The groupon got us each two scoops so we went with other different so we could sample the most possible.  I got the Apple Pie / Spiced Rum and Black Raspberry / Chambord Liqueur.  Both were awesome I actually enjoyed the Chambord the most but I was in ice cream heaven.  Laura got the Mimosa with Champagne and the Margarita / Tequila.  I really enjoyed both of her's the margarita was a strawberry one which is my fav.  The Mimosa was very refreshing and I could imagine that being a great hangover remedy at about 11am on a Saturday =) just sayin.  I have found a new place to cure my sweet cravings and can't wait to try more flavors as the website has many more I didn't see in store so I assume they are on rotation which is great.  I hope that eventually I can find a pinapple upside down cake with rum flavor
other Just happened to be in the neighborhood when we saw this BBQ place.  The pulled pork and beef did not disappoint.  The sandwiches can be called 'hardy' portions on large buns.  The sauce was excellent.  The place is very clean.  Very good service.  Was not impressed with the coleslaw - seemed flat.  Will return as the high ratings of this establishment are well deserved.
other This is the only music store on my side of town and since I never can buy online early enough, is where I usually buy my reeds. The customer service is great and they appear to have a huge selection of almost everything a music student should need.
other Best Subway anywhere. Super-friendly staff and always really clean!
3 I met some friends last night at Cadillac Ranch and this was my first time going. The space has a very odd layout, but there are two bars (one inside and one outside on the patio) and both have plenty of TVs to watch. There is also a very cliche mechanical bull, but unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) no one rode it while I was there.Service at the bar was really good, but when our group moved to a table, service became spotty. We had two servers for our table of 1other and one would take a drink order or would be asked for something and then not deliver it or something would get missed...the two servers just didn't coordinate very well. Luckily we weren't in a hurry and were a pretty laid back group. I only ate the Cadillac salad (mixed greens, tomatoes, cheese and croutons) and it was a nice size for $7.95. However, and maybe this is just a pet peeve of mine, but I hate when restaurants put the dressing on for you! I prefer for it to come on the side, as it does in almost every single restaurant I have ever been to, so I can put on as much as I would like. I did try a few of my friend's fries and they were good...not oily and for fries, they were actually pretty light. As a note, for groups, they put an automatic 20% gratuity on the bill, not the standard 18% most other places do.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place as a lunch or dinner destination as I was not impressed by the menu or the entree prices which seemed on the high side for what they were. However the three stars I am giving Cadillac Ranch are for their happy hour:$other domestics$3 imports$3 Fat Tire bottles$3 Flavored Smirnoff Vodka drinks$3 Margaritas$other Rum (Captain Morgan)$other Vodka Martinis$3.50 to $5ish select appetizers (there are about four or five)I'm always happy when I can get Stella drafts for cheap. Also, according to the bartender, one of the margaritas they serve can only be purchased a maximum of other times by one person because it is so strong. One piece of advice: If you start at the bar and move to a table, close your tab at the bar even if they offer to transfer it to your table. We had a huge mess last night and some people overpaid and some of us underpaid.
other For frozen yogurt quality, I give this place a one. Honestly, it's small, there's very little variety in terms of toppings, and the yogurt tastes cheap... Probably because it's a big franchise. There is a reason why you're paying less for an ounce... Truly - you get what you pay for. The concept is neat, sure, but if you're looking for pizzazz then you should try Yogurtini... It's just up the road from Yogurtland. Anyway, the single star says it all... "Eek! Methinks not."
other Your Mexican grammaw won't necessarily jump up anddown screaming "¡Muy Auténtico!" but this place stilldelivers. Standard Mexican fare with pretty decentservice. If you check-in on Yelp, you get a other dollaroff your meal coupon. I really like the hot sauce thatcomes with the chips and salsa. Spicy and very flavorful.And the Mango Margaritas - nice and stiff. Their entreesare good especially the enchiladas. And I usually geta side of the calabacitas. They're open till 11pm onFridays and Saturdays which is usually when I actuallymake it over here. A late dinner after some event. Parking is always good since it's a mall.
other I was taken here while visiting from Chicago and had one of the best margaritas of my life.  I tried the house (on ice with salt) and it was fantastic, but what I couldn't get enough of was the strawberry-lime one.  I couldn't taste a drop of alcohol...and that's when you know you have a good mixed drink on your hands. I honestly could have had three more it was so tasty, but my childlike tolerance for boozin did not allow it.  The bartender was super nice and friendly, we had many refills of the chips and salsa (damn you, I can never resist), and it was all in a southwestern chill environment.  Supposedly the tacos are top-notch, I will have to give them a whirl next time I'm in town.  I highly suggest going here for a happy hour or dinner.
3 Food is ok. Pad Thai is sub-par. The happy hour is very cool baby suburban around this joint. It's attached to Chandler Fashion Center, so it's busy pretty much all of the time. happy hour specials are just ok, specialty drinks are pretty expensive with little taste and even less alcohol.plus, i loathe happy hours that you can only enjoy in the "bar" area. the patio is the spot for HH, and it's LOUD. not just with vapid chatter, but with the constant scraping of meatl chairs on the concrete. it sounds like i'm being picky, but it's one of those sounds that makes your skin crawl and just kills your mood instantly - over and over and over.anyway, if you're a big time up-and-comer and want everyone to know, this is the place for you.
other With a name like "The Lodge", I thought I was going to an old dirty restaurant with some of the neighborhood locals. We went here after a soccer game two weeks ago, and I have to say, I thought I was going to be disappointed. I expected greasy food, and grimy scenery. This was not the case, although the scenery was mildly disturbing as most of the decor included some dearly departed wildlife. I had a great sandwich I believe called the healthy choice, that was supposedly was healthy? It came on this great thick toasted buttery whole grain bread, egg whites, hollindase sauce, tomato and avocado. It was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. I don't think it was a calorie saver by any means but I am sure it was just the idea it was made with healthier ingredients. For a lodge, this was a terrific restaurant, and yes this is a compliment by far, joking aside, as you remember my thoughts of what a lodge was all about. This is nothing like the local VFW. The only other scary part was this jerk at the bar decided to take his shirt off, and throw it across the room. And ladies, no, this was definitely not a pretty sight nor was it funny. They need to enforce the shirt and shoes required law here otherwise it will earn a lodgey reputation from me. Luckily, as this ghastly sight appeared, we quickly disappeared on our way home.
other If you're looking for a dining experience at Fry's deli area you're better off going to an actual sit down restaurant.  Fry's "dining style" food in the deli area is very substandard at the best.
other Delux is always really good, fresh, and it's a clean place too! I love the beet salad with chicken added. It's delish! My man digs the burgers and we both scarf the sweet potato fries. Love their dipping sauce that comes next to the ketchup, Ah-mazing!
other i moved to the tempe area about other weeks ago from socal, the mecca for asian restaurants.  since moving out here, my only taste for asian food has been panda express.  well, i was craving teriyaki last night but had no idea where to go so i did a search here.  tokyo house got a bunch of great reviews and everyone mentioned a cool old man behind the counter so i just had to check this place out.as soon as i walked in the door, i was greeted by the old man...from across the joint, behind the counter, mind you.  he was SUPER nice and SUPER funny!  checked out the menu and the selection was a bit overwhelming!  they have every teriyaki dish available, and bunch of fried rice and noodle choices, and for those that like rabbit food, vegetable dishes.  i was a bit surprised though to not see gyoza or pot stickers on the menu...was bummed out about that.i had a hard time deciding what to get but remembered Sarah W.'s review of the house chicken, so i went with that.  i went with a large order and let me tell you; if you're hungry, you definitely will be stuffed after a large order.  the dish was very tasty and delicious and was definitely overflowing with mushroom.  i love mushroom!  the house chicken is supposed to be spicy and although it had a little kick, it wasn't the "spicy" i was used to from asian joints in socal.  i wish it had a bit more rice, though.  either way, the dish was great!  i would definitely order it again!i highly recommend this joint.  you will be treated well by the cool old man behind the counter, the place is clean, the servings are generous and the  price is cheap!
other LOVE this place! I meet my husband here for lunch as often as I can. It is a bit pricey for being a fast food place but the food is so good. I always get the pita pizza and the pasta salad. Excellent place to eat. The decor is funky but the staff is usually really nice and again, the food is great!
other Very good Rubio's, very accommodating for my diet needs and the kids love their taquitos.  It is in a convenient location when you are shopping and don't have time to go home.  The management seems to be on top of things and keep the place very clean.
other Stopped back in here today for lunch with Arlin B., Robyn N. & Mike C.  They're still delivering the same upscale Asian Buffet experience here as before, including atmosphere, food & table service that are just tops so it's "Woohoo" again for this excellent restaurant!!     :-))(See previous review for more details.  Weekday Lunch Buffet is still $11.99/$10.79 Sr.)
other i used to come here with my roommate to grab an iced chai and do the crossword puzzle on our lazy, halcyon undergraduate afternoons, or come in for a warm breakfast and a cup of coffee, hungover after an amazing houseshow the night before back in the neighborhood.  this is that kind of place.great, relaxing place to do homework or study.  depending on the day and the time, you'll find professors, honors college kids, hipster bike folk - the whole gamut of the non-party-bro asu population.food is good, but a little overpriced, i think.  drinks, like any independent coffeeshop, depend on the barista, but i've never had a really bad drink experience here.  i especially like the dirty chai.
other Went in after a day of shopping with my mother. We walked into the bar side and decided we wanted to sit in the pew benches on the restaurant side instead. We ordered waters and sodas while munching on a side of chips. My mom got the chicken pot pie and loved the crust and the moist chicken. I got the Meat and Cheese. Although I wish the cheese was a bit more melty the sage pork sausage was great. The dipping gravy tasted of beer. Great addition. The music was fun and the bartender dancing to the music was fun. Great lunch! Will go again when I'm in Tempe. Another plus: enough for left overs!
3 I really want to gives this Sprout's location other stars but over the past few months when I get a deli sandwich the bread has bean stale other out of 3 times I'm there so I can't do it. If this Sprout's can consistently not give me stale bread I'd be happy.On to the rest of the store....Sprout's is a great farmer's market with a great selection of produce as well as great meats, seafood and cheeses.
other This place is always one of the first places my husband and I go to, once we are in a city that has one. Having lived in Phoenix for around 10 years, this has always been one of my favorites. Recently they have added new rolls and sushi to their menu, and I must say, Great job!
other What can I say...the food and drinks were delicious and the atmosphere is sexy yet comfortable.  But the real stars of the show where the staff!  Everyone was exceptional, funny and charming: a dashing maitre'd, a handsome and truly helpful waiter, the chef was warm and happy to explain their signature Chinese oven even though I'm sure he has to do that a thousand times a night and the support staff...wonderful.  The water ninja is not to be missed...this guy sneaks in and fills your glass with such speed and accuracy that water tension alone keeps the glass just slightly more than 100% full.  This guy amazed us with his serving mastery again and again while his plate clearing partner in crime delighted us with a quick coin trick.  Wonderful!
other Icey iced ice... tasty and refreshing, Rita's delivers.  You can't help but smile as you walk in the door, anticipating the tasty goodness that is lined up in front of you.  They have simple cream ice, milkshakes, gelati, Italian ices, frozen custard, frozen custard cookies... and on and on. We stopped by on a random, warm afternoon after passing the new store and noticing the sign... a few samples later, we were sure that we'd found a winner.  My only 'ouch' came when I found out the calories and fat in my Blendini mix.  :-/  Glad I shared it!  We'll just make Rita's an occasional splurge.Yum... Blendini!  We recommend the Vanilla custard with Toffee. :-D  See ya there!
other "You smell like smoke."  That's the greeting I received when coming home from a terrific UYE organized by BBQ lovin' Deb L.  And at that point, if my stuffed self didn't already know it, I knew I had just eaten some damn good food.Upon arriving, I had a deja vu moment of being there before...a long time ago, sipping a virgin strawberry daiquiri (I told you it was a long time ago), and thinking I was all that.  Yes, it was Bobby McGee's at one time!  So flash forward 2other years, and I'm having a strawberry lemonade "adult" beverage, which was quite tasty btw, in the company of 20 fabulous Yelpers!We were given corn bread pretty quickly, and it was devoured pretty quickly.  A little on the crumbly side, but delicious nonetheless.  Because my husband could not join us, I went with the 2-meat combo (brisket and pulled pork) so there would be some left to take him.  Yeah, that's my story.  I was a happy eater to find I could order my meats sauce free!  The brisket was good, but a little too fatty.  The pork was really good, however; adequately seasoned and smokey.  I tried the spicy sauce on the table, and found it to be just right, just a little kick to it.  For sides, the mac and cheese was creamy and not lacking in sauce.  Yum.  The roasted corn was really really good.  If corn always tasted that good, I would move to Iowa.Our service was great and they were accommodating for our request for separate checks with a 20% gratuity.  Our service was actually good enough, especially given a party that size, that I tipped extra.  And I did refrain from eating all of my meal, so that I could have a nice lunch the next day when my husband refused my offer of the leftovers.  Only problem was he didn't refuse.  And I went hungry the next day, wishing I had eaten all of my meal when I had the chance.
other When was the last time that you went to a restaurant and were still bragging about your experience two weeks later??? This is exactly what I am doing about the "Arrogant Butcher."I went there a couple of weeks ago with a bunch of folks from work. We had a private dining area and our servers name was Mark. He truly made the experience AMAZING!  His detailed, vivid descriptions of the entrees and desserts were comical and had most of us in tears. You could almost smell and taste each item as he passionately went into detail.  The appetizer- soft pretsels with cheese..OH EM GEE!!!!!!!!  Why doesn't every restaurant have these??? The crab stuffed chicken......AMAZING!We shared several desserts, one which was a peanut butter cup......stand back Reese's......you have competition now!! =)The manager came in later and had a professional, yet funny, manner about him as well.  What a great team they are.
other Food is great, but they use to let you get the happy hour specials for take out, but not anymore. I love their prime rib burger, if you have a few extra bucks to spend on the best burger in the world than go here.
other Foothills Park in North Glendale, AZ is a more than just a dog park!!!  This park has a skate park, an aquatic center / fitness center, baseball/softball fields and a branch of the Glendale Public Library.On the north side of the park is the Foothills branch of the Glendale Public Library. Here in 201other this branch has started closing earlier a couple days a week and they are now closed on Thursdays and Sundays. You can still request books online to be transferred to this branch for your convenience.The dog park was recently expanded with a new section of dog run that connects the front of the park on 57th Ave with the back of the park behind the library.  Parts of the dog park are closed a day a week for maintenance, but part of the park is open every day.The baseball fields are the area of the park I use the most. Arrowhead Little League (www.ArrowheadLL.com) is based at this park and they play two seasons - Spring and Fall. The City of Glendale also runs baseball and softball programs at this park.  A playground sits on the South side of the baseball fields, just North of the wash.The Aquatic Center (www.glendaleaz.com/foothillscenter/) has an outdoor pool with slides and lap pools.  There's a fitness center indoors with all the equipment of a normal gym plus a rock climbing wall and full indoor basketball court.  The kids love to hang out at the rec center.The skate park on the west side of 57th is an area I've avoided thus far. It's usually packed with kids riding skateboards.
other Finally made my way up to this little joint.  Owned by a couple of people who live in-State, not a corporate chain but they do have multiple locations.  Had the DeeZee.  Tasty lamb,garbanzo,potato mixture in a thick stew with a side of flavorful broth "soup" for slurping.Son had chicken kebab, very tender, very juicy, flavorful and served with basmati rice which went well with my lamb too!  Came with a cool roasted Roma tomato, spicy red onion pieces and more pita than we could eat.Had the hummous, its simple & tasty but too "chilled", next time I will ask for an extra plate and stir it up real well before we dip.GOOD SERVICE.  Friendly order takers give input on the food.  HAPPY with my selections.  We'll be back.  Two full meals with leftovers, hummous and other drinks for under $25!
other Amanda at Butterfly Petals did the flowers for my wedding. I didnt want to spend  a lot on them and shaved it down to only needing my bouquet, three boutonnieres and two corsages. I told her what I liked and didnt and my budget. She created a bunch of options for me based on my specifics so I had a  number of choices. She also did all of this via email. which I give her total kudos for. On the day of my wedding, there was a fabulous bouquet waiting for me as well as perfect corsages and boutonnieres for my groom and our parents. Amanda waited for me, even though I was terribly late, to make sure I was happy with her creations which really gave a personal touch.Butterfly Petals is creative and affordable. I love my bouquet so much that I ended up keeping it and I am having it preserved!
other This is the best Pho I've found in town yet.  Good spring rolls to, the sauce was a little to runny though.  I hit this place up 3 times a month to get my vietnamese fix.
other Had a team dinner here other weeks ago. The food was decent and since it's the closest Thai restaurant to me, very convenient. Appetizers: Angel wings-- fried chicken drumsticks stuffed with noodles and spices. Fried tofu -- just exactly like it sounds, crispy fried tofu served with a sweet fish sauce dip. Tom kha soup-- spicy lemongrass broth with mushrooms, chicken, and carrots. Mains: eggplant dish with chicken-- okay, served with a basic brown sauce. Pad thai-- too sweet and saucy for my taste. Panang curry-- I enjoyed this but we ordered this with chicken and I personally think it tastes better with beef.
other I only go for the movies or when I know what I'm getting.  Not much of a shopper but I remember having fun here when I still lived in L.A. and came to visit.
other Four days and maybe seven hours ago, our hunger brought us forth to eat cheesesteak, to try a new restaurant, conceived in Philly, but dedicated to the proposition that not all cheesesteaks are created equal.We shared a large chicken cheesesteak with everything (onions, bell peppers), and cheese wiz, along with some sweet potato fries.The chicken cheesesteak came with a good amount of tender chicken, with a lot of flavor.  There is a free-range mini fridge that is stocked with sweet , hot peppers, and fry sauce which is nice so you can customize your order with as many or as little peppers as you want.  While the ingredients were good quality, the cheesesteak as a whole naturally doesn't really compare to any I've had in Philly, but it's good for Arizona!The sweet potato fries were my favorite part of the meal.  They tasted freshly cut, and were excellently cooked with just the right amount of crunch while still tender and sweet inside.So would our forefathers be impressed by Forefathers?  They probably wouldn't know what a cheesesteak would be, but if they tasted one, I would say they would be!
other While my partner and I don't normally like chain restaurants Ling & Louie's is an exception. They're a small chain of only two restaurants they are franchising. We both started with Miso soup which was okay. Then we moved on to Potstickers, on of our favorites. they were very good, but not outstanding. For our entree's I ordered Firecracker Chicken with Broccoli and my partner ordered Meatball Sliders. The Chicken was VERY spicy, but also very good. I didn't have room to try the Meatball Sliders but here they were also very good. All-in-all it was a pretty good meal and the service was perfect.
other There is no shortage of Mexican restaurants in AZ and this one is one of the tops on my list.  It's not your average Mexican fast food.  It's a little more pricey but well worth it.  Their bean and cheese burrito is so good (they say no lard and I don't know what else they use to make it good).  Their carne asada and pastor tacos are done to perfection.  I stop by whenever I pass by this place.
3 love dicks, richardsons etc etc but come on I'm throwing down 120$ get some  servers / managers with customer service skills.
other I was pleasantly surprised by Sauce. We went here for dinner last night, and wanted something quick, tasty and casual. Done. I think of it as a cross between a fast food place and a pizzeria.I had the Pepperoni and Crimini Mushroom pizza, and it was great. The crust is amazingly thin yet perfect for the pie. The center where the toppings are is a nice and soft but the edges are super crispy with a chip-like "crunch". The sauce and toppings were noticeably fresh and perfectly proportioned on the pizza.M had the Turkey salad, and she too was very pleased. I can describe hers much - as we both stuck to our plates!The waitstaff was very pleasant and everything came out well; however nothing really blew me away to earn that 5th star.
other It was an OK gyro for almost twice as much as the other places I've been to. It had a ridiculous amount of mutton sausage (that's what "gyro meat" is, fwiw,) and was pretty tasty, but not as good as a $other gyro at Ali Baba. The price you pay for location, I guess.This would have gotten three stars, but then it gave me indigestion all day and I couldn't eat dinner, so it loses some for that.
3 We ordered from here the first day in our new home, also the first NFL Sunday this season. I was expecting about an hour wait. They quoted me 4other minutes for delivery, and when the doorbell rang after 20 I thought it was solicitors or perhaps neighbors coming to welcome us into the neighborhood. I was pleasantly surprised that it was our food. We ordered a mushroom pizza (meh), and wings and chicken tenders - both very tasty. We're used to more thin crust pizzas, NY style I guess? so this was a bit doughy, but the garlic herb crust was yummy nonetheless. Not sure if we'll order from here again, unless we don't find our NY style place, but it was still good.
other This has become one of my favorites.  They're friendly,  reasonably priced and the food is always delicious.  My husband and I have tried a number of their items, but my personal favorites are the BBQ pork appetizer, house fried rice, the mushu and lemon chicken.  My husband also loves the house fried rice, the mushu and the orange chicken.  One of the things that is so wonderful about this place is, the food isn't heavy.  The sauces are light and fresh tasting.  Plus, I'm lucky enough to be in their delivery zone.  When I get delivery, the food is still hot and tastes like it was made just a few minutes earlier.I have yet to be disappointed by anything I've ordered here, and to me, that's a sign of a good restaurant.
other Someone asked the question in the Yelp talk threads where the best place was for fried things, like french fries and onion rings.  Several people said Ted's had great onion rings......so off I went!  I expected a smaller place but I was pleasantly suprised when I pulled up to a medium sized store.  I was greated with a smile and asked what I would like.  It was a Sunday afternoon so they were not very busy.  I liked the fact that you tell them what you want and they toss it on the grill right in front of you.  Everything is freshly cooked.  They did the same with the onion rings and french fries too.  Everything was fresh and hot.  My daughter had her favorite....a hot dog, which she loved, and fries which were fresh and crisp.  I had a burger and onion rings.  Yes, the onion rings were delicious!  The batter was great and the onions were a little on the sweet side.  My burger was cooked to perfection.  This is another great little place we will go back to.  It's also sort of near my work so maybe I'll get out one day and go here for lunch.  Thanks Ted's and Yelpers!
other This ice has the abilty to make you feel COLD on a 100+ degree day - I am hooked on the Key Lime, Alex's Lemonade, and Florida Orange. Very nice staff, friendly and free samples ....
other Johnnie's Garbage dog is the work of the God's. You can't go wrong with any of the dog's here so when you can't make up your mind and everything looks so good - why not just have it all! Seriously try this one. Be forewarned it can be messy, so get a good grip because once you pick it up you won't be able to put it down.
other I love Fuddruckers because I can put my own toppings on including gooey, melty fake cheese!  Also, they have frings (a combo of fries and onion rings).  Very tasty.
3 Would have been other stats based on prior visit. This past visit the service was just garbage. Not the servers fault, she should have never been on the floor in the first place. Pretty annoyed that she had to ask other servers for assistance while taking our order. What's the soup? I don't know, Jim what's the soup? Is there cheese on the French dip. I don't know? Karen is there cheese on the French dip? The food has always been great and we will be back. Hopefully I can give them other stars next visit? Oh yeah, love the.new location!
other I am a huge Suns fan but my review is about the fundraising options that the Suns have to offer as well as their back-office staff.First and foremost, talk about a professional, classy organization. Whether you have fundraising experience or are a total novice, the staff treats you like you are the only group they are working with. My contact is Kyle Pottinger and he is always a gentleman. No matter what questions I have, he always answers them promptly and never makes me feel like I'm bothering him. The fundraising process is easy and the tickets practically sell themselves because who doesn't want the chance to purchase discounted tickets? The process is easy and the rewards can be lucrative depending on the target audience you are working with. The Suns will treat you professionally and courteously. You won't be disappointed.
other I was stuck between wanting to give a two star & three star. The concept of this place is a great idea. I have to say that if you happen to go on a day that there's a large party going on, it kinda like you're an unwanted fly on the wall. This play town is located in a large older shopping center that blends in with the other faded store fronts. Inside, the owners seemed to be very nice, although stressed due to hosting a party there. I was very bummed that the jump house was removed. That was 65% of the reason to go. All in all it had it's little themed houses to play in, but the whole place seemed to need a good fresh painting as well as cleaning. $8 admission.
other One of the best croissants in town, if not #1.  I base my rating solely on this and the consistently friendly service.
other This hotel is amazing! The staff is very friendly, it's very  clean and it has wide space for a hotel room, nice swimming pool with a heated pool. They have free breakfast and free dinner:) and it's pretty much near with everything you need: mall, restaurants and bars:)
3 The main reason to miss a star is that the one that we ordered (the mint-lamb) was a bit dry to my taste and no mint to taste at all. For desert we had the apple one and that was much better. I'd like to try a different one some other time and compare :).Good environment, and for groups, friendly staff who would explain you what they are cooking!!
other A bit pricey, yet one of the best breakfast sandwiches you will find.  Parking is slim.
other When owners/staff changed we kept hoping for the best.  (The friendly owners/cooks of the previous restaurant were top notch, hence the good reviews).  But now, alas. . . Lemon chicken that turned out to be pork (and bad at that), wontons in soup that fall apart, greasy greasy lo mein and eggrolls, it's just not worth it.  Prefer to give locals the business, but this is truly awful, even after many hopeful tries.  Panda Express it is until someone else does a better job.
other The "hood" is a colloquialism not intended to imply "ghetto" or any particularly dangerous neighborhood. I am a proud resident of the Biltmore 'hood and my neighbors are retired Mormon doctors who all own corgis and drive Buicks and have umbrellas with "Vanguard Investments" emblazoned on them.Anyway, even though the neighborhood isn't particularly risky it's dangerous just having this place so close to me. After a particularly harsh day at work I treated myself to the carne asada burro combo. Highly addictive, and there's probably enough fat in the tortilla alone -- never mind the filling -- to keep me and an African village or two going for a week or so. Nevertheless, it's delicious and a great antidote to an evening spent with too much single-malt and too many cigars and some women named Wanda and Clarissa. Those who know . . . . know . . . Anyway, go and enjoy.
other "6 inch tuna on white bread, with everything including spinach, but NO pickles".Not even joking, this THE only subway that ever gets my sandwich right. Thank you for the $other meal deal, it beats the other chains in this shopping plaza as far as price for lunch.
other This place not recommend, food was cold, rice was soggy, lettuce wilted, and beans runny.
other Went there with the Wife. Lots of stuff for the ladies. I would lay off making any real purchase here on my own, I would of course consult the Mrs. In regards to what she might like. Way to tough to try and pick something out in here (Louis Vuitton, Gucci, etc.) that is the stuff for the ladies to decide on. Nice place, very friendly staff, warm, and inviting one to buy.
other Y'know, rarely do I buy the "extended warranty" that most places try to peddle on you nowadays. If you buy the item from a reputable manufacturer, it should be unnecessary. In the case of tires, I have to make an exception. You can control the quality of tires you buy and put on your car, but not the quality of construction workers who don't know how to secure their nails, screws and bolts for travel on highways, streets and other local thoroughfares. They're a nefarious bunch for the most part. I'm not for extra taxes, but I'm contacting my local elected officials to institute a tax on all businesses who transport these little metal devils on the streets we drive...and stiff penalties/massive fines if they get caught dropping a load of these on the highway. For the second time in a year, one of my tires caught one of the little buggers -- this last one was not a nail or screw, mind you, but a BOLT.  I pulled my receipts from the glove compartment, used Yelp to find the nearest Discount Tire, and called for a tow. The replacement certificates I got were $16 per tire (back in NC, but they're good here too), and worth every penny. The folks at this Discount Tire location were extremely nice, and had me in and out of there in about 30 minutes (with no appointment). There is even free water for customers. They were able to fix the tire instead of replacing it, which is fine (as long as it holds). Every Discount Tire location I've visited has been great as far as the transparency of what you're getting, the quality of customer service, and the wait. In a town of 4.3 million people and never-ending road construction, I have to recommend the free replacement warranty on your tires, no matter where you buy them. I prefer getting mine from DT.
other I love this place. I'm mostly here at dinner time to pick up my favorite roasted turkey artichoke panini and sometimes salad and soup as well! The staff is super friendly and recognize when my boyfriend and I show up, maybe because he can never leave without getting a dozen of their amazing cookies! The manager Kaylee is fabulous, she makes us feel right at home and is never unsatisfactory. They may have a smaller parking lot but I guess I have always had good luck with finding a spot! I know I will continue to come back for more.
other Decided to go for Round other for a light dinner this time.  I found the food and service to be superior to our last experience.The husband and I shared the mini mushroom pan fry, and I see why it is their signature dish.  It was so good that I will not be sharing next time.  We also had the dungeness crab stack.  This is pricey ($20) for a small plate, but it was fabulous.  We had the cuppa' red hot chocolate to finish.  It was a to-die-for dessert.  A chocolate pot de creme (custard) with chipotle crema and a chocolate chipotle cookie.  Spicy, rich, decadent, all good things.Our server was excellent from start to finish.  This time I am confident we will return, just maybe not at lunch.
other So freaking good.  The drinks are great too.  Ask for "the icon" not on menu, but very good!Love everything I had there!  Service is great and food is absolutely delicious!  Wish I lived closer!
other Steakhouses are competitive today and the typical Yelper probably has his or her favorite.  My good friend and I were eager to see the type of energy that the new investors have injected into a local legend, the Wigwam in Litchfield Park. As time was flying by, in the last 10 years, the AZ Kitchen (also in the Wigwam Resort) closed for dinner.  This southwestern gem was also affectionately called the 'Snake Pit' by a friend but the service was top notch and it was one of the earlier restaurants that provided full view of the kitchen by diners.  The Wigwam's ballroom dining has now been converted to Red's Steakhouse. Service started out well with a nice touch of a choice of fruit for your water.  The waiter had recommendations but also allowed us time to ponder the menu.  We opted for the couple's dinner, essentially a prix fixe with a salad, choice of sea bass or steak, and the shared dessert.  We also decided to try the crab cake appetizer - just to adventure through the menu a bit; this resulted in a stern warning from the waiter that the steaks were 1other ounces. The crab cake was a nice presentation with fresh crab and a toasted crunchy top and colorful spinach bottom.   The side avocado dressing was a bit heavy for the crab and appeared similar to the faux guacamole at cheaper eateries.  However the crab was dry and the waiter brought more of this dressing out for us. The service with the Caesar salad presentation began to falter. The salad is the craze of serving entire stalks of the romaine and a toasted slice of bread.  Reminding the waiter for salt and pepper, he promptly provided a set and advised us the salt was also in a grinder. My friend determined that the pepper grinder was broken and did not provide a coarse grind and the waiter asked if we would like another pepper grinder.  Actually, for the prix fixe price of $45, I really wanted the waiter to politely grind the salt and pepper over our salads.  The crouton had no flavor. Our steaks were done as ordered but the NY Strip did not have a lot of flavor. The menu indicates the meat is grilled at 1600 degrees. However, my medium rare steak really appeared to be grilled on my a standard grill with no caramelizing or searing to hold in the rare juices. The steaks were true to size of waiter's tip. The steaks were served with two asparagus stalks which appeared to be white asparagus with green tips, a unique veggie for the plate. An au gratin potato patty also accompanied the steak and was quite yummy. As the server boxed up our plates, they brought out a raspberry mouse.  Its flavor did not impress either of us but my girlfriend did find the mascarpone center and it was addictive. Service was not astute nor attentive and sometimes baffling.  We were just into the meal when the waiter dramatically closed the drapes of the window near us. One of the other diner's called out in sadness to lose the evening sun but the waiter shushed her and said they would be opened intermittently to avoid blinding other diners. Could Red's should consider awnings or subtle window shades to preserve our dining views? The Wigwam may not be hoppin' just yet; but  as we left the restaurant, the three restaurants on Old Litchfield Road - outside the gates of the resort - were busy as locals may have enjoyed more reasonable fare and better service.  These restaurants are our next adventure!
other Love their pizza and atmosphere. Their Caesar salad is really good too. They had a great deal during the summer, where we got other salads, other large pepperoni pizza and a bottle of wine for $40.
other Yucca is a great neighborhood library, if I may say so.  It's not huge, but you can place holds on anything from any Phoenix library, get on the internet, read the paper, and any number of other things.
other Sundae for Sunday.Pink spot helps me go through the summer heat.
other I used to come here about once a week for their amazing vegetarian sandwiches. My favorite is the griefo with pepper jack cheese, hemp cream cheese, guacamole, sprouts, lettuce, black olives, onions, mushrooms, cucumbers, and tomatoes. The hemp cream cheese is to DIE for seriously! I also enjoy the humbolt, which is very similar, and the majic mushroom with sliced portabella mushrooms, teriyaki glaze, green bell peppers, pineapple and pepper jack cheese. The 8inch is soo big but makes a great and filling lunch. You can't beat the prices either. Get the garlic herb bread, it is the best. The only thing I do not like about this place is that the whole "marijuana" theme can get old and annoying. This location can also get really really busy and the sandwiches take time to make. Staff is usually pretty friendly and social though. One last thing is that if you eat there or have to wait for a while your clothes will smell like food :/
other Great Happy Hour. Get the TACO BASKET~!Thursday-Mexican Beer $3
other So my friend and I stumbled upon this place on our way to Barb's bakery but WOW I have never had a better taco in my life. The carne asada street tacos are freaking amazing. They also have the bottled cokes from mexico that for some reason taste sweeter than cokes bottled here. The waitress was also extremely friendly when we were checking out we asked how to pronounce the name of the restaurant and she started teaching us some Spanish.
3 I, like another reviewer, was not willing to fight for lunch at McDonald's... and so I travelled up the road to Burger King. I haven't been to a BK in years and have heard several quips about their "new and updated menu." I got a Whopper Jr. meal (no update there). Their fries are good, more satisfying than other fast food restaurants-- "now with sea salt"-- as if that makes them more appealing. The Whopper Jr. itself is just... meh.. I'm sorry, I don't do mayo. I do appreciate the fresh (?) veggies on top though. Soda seems syrupy here to me.If McDonald's is busy, head here. They DO have a nice outdoor patio, though. And Iike their workers' uniforms better. Does that count??
other What's with the cheese?  It isn't even Velveta.  It's liquid cheese food and it belongs somewhere other than on my burger.$other burger and fries is a great deal IF -- IF -- it's a great deal.  This is just liquid cheese food on a hamburger patty.  McDonald's will do a burger and fries for $other that's tastier than this dump.
other Their frozen drinks carried me through last summer. They have free air (for your tires) and water (for the radiator) at every location I've ever been to. Their hot sandwiches, though greasy, aren't TOO greasy and actually taste like food. The coffee is pretty good, and they have more ways to tart it up than Starbucks does. QT frickin' rocks.And BTW, the QT stands for Quick Trip.
other I love this PHO and spring rolls, and for the friendly and fast service plus it's cheap! Oh it's truly a must try place.
other A relaxing place to have wine, and talk with the very knowledgable (what is the difference between cab franc and Carménère), great service (waitress came on time and performed pourings properly) and sexy (well at least the waitress) staff.  Blue/Black diamond wine bar - Great for me and deliberate by the wine bar - Medium/Advanced wine patrons come on down.   Newbies stay away because you're not going to get educated.  Just dont tell anyone about the place during live music night...I continue to come back year after year when i am in phoenix because of the athmosphere and wine selection.  Very extensive wine selection (3000+ bottles) on file make you wonder where are they hiding it all in this cozy location. And now the critque:Waitstaff has a bit of the starbucks effect where they are act with an aire  of being smarter than the patrons.  They serve Bistro and flatbread style food - perhaps my choice was silly but it over salted my palatte to the point it started to strip the roof of my mouth.  With such a wine list, a little more probing from the waitstaff to make the pairing work out would be helpful. If you're going to act smarter than the patron, be more 'intrusive' in helping pair the menu.I am used to wine bars around the country and the prices are above average most likely caused by the scottsdale area effect. Finally, bring your solid black "going out to the club"  outfit - seems to be the uniform of choice of this speakeasy-like patrons.  Great dark athmo to take and sauce liberally your date.Give it a shot.
3 Why do people love this place?  MommaKat insisted on snacking here after a hard day of shopping, and I am not impressed.  AT ALL.I had to coerce the boy behind the counter to make a salad my way, not the normal recipe.  It was like pulling teeth.. no seriously, no cheese.  and I want this dressing not that dressing.  We stood in line for over 20 minutes at 4pm on a Saturday.  There were other couples in front of us.  LAME.There were no forks, and the cashier forgot to give me my brownie, and i thought he was going to have a conniption when I asked twice.Bathrooms were very nice and clean though.  Outdoor seating is very limited. Lame excuse for a panera-
other Thank God there were some Mesa firemen standing outside this place when I pulled up as my wife was very uneasy about exiting our car and heading in.  Even trying to explain how fellow Yelpers loved it, did not ease her fears.  After a unanimous "Defnitely, it's awesome!" amongst the three battlers of the flame in response to my "Is this place worth going to?", we parked the car and walked on in.  This place is a definite hole in the wall (read: DUMP) and I/we LOVED it!  Great chicken tacos, awesome machaca (shredded beef) burros, delicious chorizo and the tamales were equally spectacular (homemade of course).  It's located in a somewhat dicey area of Phoenix, due west of the airport, but it's totally worth going to.  It has become my new "first stop" after I get off the plane at Sky Harbor.....unless I land too late at night....
3 Ok... So I am a sucker for a great breakfast joint that isn't some huge national chain.  Maybe it's the fact that orange county seriously lacks many good breakfast joint option.  Secondly, the fact that they have dog friendly patio service elevates the place in my book.Our trips to Scottsdale aren't complete until we make a stop here for breakfast.  The portions are huge!  The surprising part is that the food is good, which is not usually the case with places with places that do large portions (usually hoping that size covers up the taste).With their Mexican options such as the breakfast burrito or huevos ranchero... They knock the cover off the ball.  The green chil pork in the huevos rancheros is fantastic and keeps me coming back for it.
other "I totes spent half my paycheck here while making out under a palmtree that's no longer there and eating tofu and sauce with my girlfriend/boyfriend/person i needed to impress/first date/ex-boss/lover/landlord/twitter pal! It's edgy and modern and makes me feel like my $80 blouse was worth it and that I'm worldly and cultured and blah blah blah blah blah...". There's no fighting what looks like a small legion of wanna-be hipsters and pseudo romantics who can't get enough of this place or it's food. And who apparently feel great about dropping $50 to $100 for 1.other ounces of food. VERY impressive. Good for you.In my opinion, it ain't all it's cracked up to be: first, pay attention to how many fried foods are on the menu....fried tofu, fried quail, fried wontons, fried chicken wings, fried pork on sugar cane. Yeah - it's a LOT of fried items. They even fry some of the shrimp in their salad items, i'm told. Hmmmmmmm. Bit overpriced for what you get. Some items are either smothered in gobs of soy sauce (duck breast), or have so little taste that they NEED the sauce (spring rolls - lay off the Anise!!). So....basically you're paying higher prices for gussied-up, MSG-ridden, fried nibbles - even if they ARE tapas. Funny how many people write reviews of this place stating that they were WASTED when they went...maybe because we naturally desire greasy food when we're drunk?I've had friends go and love some items(lime mint beef, red curry tofu, miso) and dislike others (fried pork, gyoza, overcooked fried wontons). I've also had friends tell me they've seen everything from cooks picking food out of their teeth with their fingers behind the counter to death looks from Chu because they clicked their chopsticks together too loudly, or asked for their food to come out on time. It seems he's not the little "darling" that some make him out to be.The music  (on some nights) can be occasionally good, but also gets repetitive and loud. Sometimes this place tries too hard to be New Yorkish - while existing in the remote patchwork of dirt lots making up the roosevelt district (or as some call it, "Cenpho". still looks like a lot of empty dirt lots to me).And occasional HOUR wait times?! What is this: Matt's Big Shumai? It's small food! Get over it!Looks like a lot of people "need" this place to be something it just isn't, for whatever reason. You are a fickle, mysterious and too often Lemming-esque crowd, my dear phoenix.
other Its pretty expensive..  Everything's about other dollars minimum but the food is quality.  The flavors aren't very new and exciting, but you can tell the ingredients are quality and they don't skimp.  The texture is good quality.  Love the whole almonds in the rocky road!  :D
3 Not terrible.  I got the drunken noodles and pad thai.  Not the best, but not the worst.  Maybe I'll try them again and update my review...
other I give this review a total other star If I was able to, I would have rated no stars at all!.... I would NEVER reccomend ANYONE to live here. The office staff is horrible and made me feel uncomfortable the whole year I lived there based on THEIR MISTAKES! I can not express how disappointed I am with the way that they have treated me.....
other Consistency is an issue with the Chipotle chain. Some of their restaurants are clean and well run, some are not.  They really need to trim the chicken of the chewy parts before they chop it up and throw it in a burrito.  That really sucks.
other Fez is RIGHT down the street from where I work, hence due to its location + general fabulousness, it has become a regular spot for happy hour.Here's What we LOVE about Fez:-Sweet Potato Fries (sooo good--sprinkled with cinnamon by the way)-Kisra and Hummus!-The Black Bean Burger (the first time I ordered it, I asked the server: "Now, is this one of those really bad black bean burgers or does it actually taste good?"  She said, "I totally know what you mean, no this one is good."-and she was right!)-Margarita Mondays (aka other for one Margaritas--check out the pomegranate one!!)-The atmosphere--blue and green tones while still being warm-The friendly service-The close proximity to light railHere's what we don't like as much:-The slow service (sometimes it gets kind of bad, I feel like you have to be an active restaurant goer and hail down your server--otherwise you may never get to order, get more water/another drink, or get your check)-When happy hour ends (I mean, who likes that anywhere?)Fez makes me very happy to work in downtown Phoenix.
other We just go there for lunch and its always very good.  I got a burger and a stella.  Both hit the spot.  Our bartender was spot on. Only complaint, please clean that crap up off the floor come on.
other We brought the entire family to Giuseppe's last night for a pre-Thanksgiving meal... yes, that's right - my family likes to carb up for all of the eating we do today!  We brought a ton of wine and had a great time.  Franco was our waiter - and I'm guessing since all the ladies at the table had a crush on him, that he is the waiter Sheila B wrote about in her review too.  Nice eye candy!I absolutely love the eggplant rollatini and pretty much order it every visit.  We usually start with a Giuseppe's Salad and finish with a dessert to share.  My favorite is the white chocolate tartufa.Pasquale (pictured above) is the sweetest man and makes the experience extra special every single time.  Since I'm writing this review on Thanksgiving, I want to give thanks to Pasquale and Ristorant Giuseppe for all the good times I've had there and all of the good times to come!  Salud!
other Along with pretty much everyone else who has left a review for this place, I LOVE THIS PLACE. I grew up in the area and one night my dad and brother wanted to check it out (my brother is a Yelp addict and saw it had amazing reviews). I was skeptical since, driving past, it is your typical "hole in the wall" kind of place, but I was not disappointed at ALL. The carne asada burrito is amazing, even the salad it comes with is great. I think my favorite thing aside from that would have to be the aguas frescas, particularly the orange one...SO good. You probably will not regret ordering a single thing from this menu. I've gone back countless times, one time bringing one of my friends who was convinced that anywhere a blonde gringa tried to take her for Mexican food would be craptastic, but she loved it too.
3 I am going to give Aunty Chiladas 3 stars only because I have gone there since I was like 10.  This place has been a staple in the valley before the 5other went by etc etc.  It definitely looks like it has been there for a while and needs a good  asthetic cleaning.  Our table and chairs were sticky and it was pretty dirty outside on the patio.  There were chairs and miscellaneous items on the outside of the restaurant and it needs some TLC.Chips (flour) are good but salsa has black olives (yuk, personal preference) and the hot stuff tasted like it had vinegar in it.  It has a great patio for daytime drinking.  Overall the food is above average.I ordered the fish tacos and they were good.  My accomplice ordered a combo with your typical rice, beans, enchilada, taco etc.  The food was hot and good.  It didn't have a wow factor but the price was good and worth the money.Holy smokes.......The service was awful.  I am not going to mention any names but it was slow in terms of business and even slower in terms of service.  I hope that they do not correlate but they usually do.  C'mon Aunty you are better than this!!!!!!  If you live in the neighborhood then it is worth going here.  I probably will not make the drive again.  Good luck Aunt Chiladas.
other Used a Groupon here, and it was a great experience! The express mani/pedi wasn't express at all - they took their time with me, and everything felt great!The woman who did my pedicure was fantastic. My toes and feet look wonderful!The woman who did my manicure was pretty good. The only issue is that she accidentally cut my thumb. When it bled a little, she just painted over it. It's now been a few days, and my thumb still hurts. Overall, it was a good experience though, and the staff was very friendly! I would return for sure.
other Sanctuary you've been replaced.  Willow Stream Spa is my new fav spa spot.  Loved. Loved. the service.Robe got slightly damp from use, helpful attendant appears and gives me a new one.  Loved the waterfall treatment.  Loved private rooftop pool.  Loved the attendant walking around giving us sun bathers bottles of cold water.  Loved the fitness classes, the facility.All this for $50 during AZ Spa Week.  The facility and service is so f-a-b-u-l-o-u-s here that I would come here anytime and think every penny I spent was worth it!
3 First off, it's fast Chinese, and they lived up to their promise on that one, we did get our dinners fast. I am a huge fried rice fan; and I have to say theirs was horrible, stick to plain white or brown rice. However, I had the beef with broccoli and that was ok. It's not like Beef with broccoli is exploding with flavor anyways, so I can confidently say they didn't mess it up. What I do like about this place (besides how quick our food came out) is that you can do the meal deal , typically only offered at lunch, for dinner which gets you the egg roll and crab puff at dinner. I love crab puffs, again theirs was just ok and I didn't care for the egg roll all that much. Overall it was fast, filled me up with a huge portion that I took home lots of left overs; they were open kind of late - until 10, and it wasn't the worse thing I ever ate. Also, they had very friendly service.
other This is one of my favorite breakfast restaurants! They carry the best bran muffin I've ever had....it has a delicious brown sugar topping on it. I love coming here on special occasions!
other I can't stop talking about the fried chicken at Chelsea's. It is sooooo good.We went here on Saturday night with a group of friends, and we had a great time. We sat at one of the large tables on the front porch, which was perfect, although our friend was disappointed that we weren't on the back porch. Supposedly that's the place to be. Since I had never been, I didn't know the difference.I always feel that tables of 8 are a good test for a restaurant's service. I felt like our waitress did a good job, and I was actually shocked at how quickly some of the food came (I am sure they are popular dishes that the kitchen makes in high volume, but still - she did a good job of getting them to our table). I started with a caesar salad, which I didn't think was that great. It was fine, but it wasn't as good as I expected. I then enjoyed the fish tacos for dinner, which were really tasty. The dish was plentiful, and it was more than enough food. My husband ordered the fried chicken, which was absolutely divine. The chicken was so moist and tender, and the chicken was fried without being greasy. Yummmm.I tried the red velvet cake for dessert, and it was quite good. How can anything with cheesecake frosting be wrong?This is a great casual upscale restaurant. I was disappointed that I hadn't been sooner. The atmosphere is great, and the location is good. Plus, there's plenty of parking (and valet), so it's just convenient. I sort of feel like that's what this restaurant is - a convenient staple when you want a solid meal. The prices are slightly high for what it is ($18 for fish tacos and rice?), but I am desensitized to the high restaurant prices here unfortunately.
other Consistent offerings of service, food, atmosphere and drinks is what makes this franchise successful. No matter whether I've been to Fogo in DC, Baltimore or here in Scottsdale, I get the same gut-busting food and well-made drinks in a place where I could either wear a suit and tie or jeans and a t-shirt.A specific note on this particular location- there were a lot of families with small children on this particular Friday night. No judging, but I've never seen that at any other Fogo. Fogo back east is really "date night" or the kind of place to pre-game for a bachelor party or a business dinner, but not to bring infants and toddlers. Possibly a by-product of its location on Scottsdale Road in a strip mall near a few hotels. IMHO, this is not the place to bring kids, but I respect the rights of anyone to do so. If I was traveling w/ kids in tow and I didn't have a Fogo in my city, it'd be hard to pass up. In any regard, it did not bother me in the least. I was too wrapped up in my company and the food and those drinks. You will easily spend over $7other per person here including tip, so prepare to camp out, eat slowly, enjoy your meal and be treated like royalty.The house special sirloin will make you rethink how to prepare sirloin at home, it's that good. Don't fill up on salad at the salad bar- you can do that at Olive Garden- but do enjoy the cheeses, mushrooms, vegetables and cold cuts which raise the salad bar. Did you see what I just did there?Nice wine selections here. Ask for a Brazilian red to enjoy with your meal if you have the coin.
other When I heard about this place I was really excited because it is hard to find really friendly vegetarian food in Tempe.  The atmosphere here is great and very sunny.  It is in a strip mall which takes away from it a bit, but the inside has a funky feel to it.  I always want to like the food, but something is just off every time.  The black bean burger is good, but it comes on an untoasted piece of wheat bread that gets all soggy and falls apart.  Everything else is OK, but why do they do that.  It makes it disgusting.  Put it on a bun like normal people.
other Starbucks is Starbucks when it comes to the coffee and food, but the staff at this location are particularly helpful and nice. One offered to help me decide on what drink to choose, and promised that if I did not like it, he would make me another one free of charge. The seating is a bit limited because the place is somewhat small, but other than that, an above average cookie cutter Starbucks.
other Let me start out by saying I usually hate pawn shops, but when I walked into this Pawn 1st location I was surprisingly happy with how clean it was. The employees were super helpful and friendly. They were even upbeat and humorous! It didn't stink like the other pawn shops tend to either.Pawn 1st buys pretty much anything you want to sell and it is a very organized place. If I ever wanted to pawn anything again, I would definitely go here again.
other Nice little find for casual sushi
other Finally a Japanese owned sushi bar beside Sakana in Ahwatukee!  I guess Sushi Ken has been here for a while, but I didn't realize what a great find it was.  My wife and I went there to splurge on Japanese sushi since they are better than the typical Korean owned sushi places which are most common in the Phoenix area.  We found we didn't splurge at all as we do at Sakana or Hiro.  We didn't break $30, which surprised me.  other stars for value and great sushi!Domo Arigato!
other Too long.......it took me way too long to make it to Sens. Sens is what we need more of in Phoenix!Seated promptly on a Friday night by Johnny Chu himself, Johnny Chu really has put together a winner here, Johnny Chu.....alright, I admit it...I like saying his name!The Asian tapas idea is new to me, having dined at some great Tapas places from Chicago to Vegas,  but alas never an Asian tapas joint. I must say no Spanish tapas place ever made me feel like Sens did (except the time I drank a pitcher of Sangria)!The Tofu dishes are amazing. How do you learn to love Okra? Get it at Sens. The Hong Kong rice noodles were not what I was expecting so I was a little taken back by them looking like a plateful of water chestnuts. One taste was all that was needed to cure my trepidations about the flavor - fantastic!I will be back to Sens Tapas & Sake Bar soon - do you think you could invent an "Asian Sangria"? C'mon Johnny, I know you can do it!
3 Seriously need a remodel, but totally worth the money due to the free 24hr shuttle in a other mile radius!! Nice staff. Clean. Just worn down a bit...
other I don't know why i have been here more than once, but the parking is horrible, and the food is only so-so.  lots of color and flare but not much going for it.  the baja sauce is great but i seem to get sick later that evening when i eat it.  i need to learn from experience
3 A bit slow for an airport setting and the staff were blaming each other for an order gone wrong for the customer in front of me...tacky.
other Recently a friend at the gallery was very excited because it was Dollar taco night a Chicos.  That is fine if you have any idea of where it is.  Turns out I had been by there more then a few times when I went to the Safeway and Subway at 7th st and McDowell.  It's a little place in a very small strip center.  It's very much a neighborhoodplace,  clean with an upbeat atmosphere and a few tables outside.  That's about all I can say about the setting.I was surprised by the variety of meats that one can get on the tacos.  The tacos aren't  to exciting but on the whole are fresh and have a good flavor better than I would have expected.  That is all I had but from what I saw of the meals around me, hey looked pretty good as a whole.I will go back to Chico's.  It definitely has fare that is better than the local fast food in the same price range.  Not an exciting place but pleasant to think of returning to.  I went there after a very long day so that is saying something.  Just the enjoyment of quite of the few people just sitting down and having a good time rubbed of on me.  I needed it!
other Coming from a French family on my mom's side it is ingrained in my genes to love cooking, food, and shops like Sur La Table...oh and also wine and cheese...what a tough life I live!Sur La Table is a classy cooking shop which offers high end cooking ware, appliances, and also dishes. Somethings in the store can be pricey, but you can also find good deals as well. They offer many cooking things you wouldn't find at your average Crate and Barrel for more complicated cooking endeavors. I have also found some cute cookie cutters here for my mom's collection. The staff was all very helpful and knowledgeable. and many Sur La Table's now offer cooking classes!
other I'm embarrassed at the number of times I've eaten here since it opened.  i used to live half a mile from here and was one of the first people in the door.  The bruschetta is the best in town--period, end of discussion.  The salads sometimes aren't my favorite, but there are plenty that are delicious.  I'll admit that the cheese plates also sometimes leave me wanting, but that is a rare occasion.  It has been interesting to see the wine selections evolve over the past several years.  When it first opened, Postino seemed to have nothing above $35/bottle, and that selection was good.  It stepped up its game in the past two or three years and now boasts a more diverse and more expensive selection (e.g., Sea Smoke pinot noir).  I appreciate the addition of even better wine, and am happy to say that the glass list remains reasonably priced.
other My friend and I have been going to camelback spa for about other years for our birthdays. this past year we decided to try something new. We went to Desert Ridge Spa for a change of pace - man were we ever sorry we did. the facilites are not nearly as nice as Camelback, the food service sub par at best - while they did make it right - the fact that my friend ordered one thing and was given another and we complained to the waitress her response, was "oh I was curious at which one of you got the wrong order" Really?? you knew that and didn't come up to us? I asked for my burger medium and it came well done, I am glad I didnt wait for her to come back and ask how my food was cause it was 1/other hour before she came back. I was parched for some water. Although they gave us our food for free - it was just inexcusable. Have had better massages at Massage Envy- will not be going back
other I read about Scramble on line so I thought I would go there for brunch and I loved it!! The Santa Fe eggs Benedict are amazing! The staff is friendly and the ambiance is incredible. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!!!
other This place is a lil bit of awesomeness! The food was great, the service was awesome, and the atmosphere was very nice! What's not to like about a great steakhouse that serves great food and provides awesome service.
other I was craving some sweets today and told my husband about this place. Apparently, one needs to make an appointment but my husband made one right away when he called. We got a Baileys cupcake, a chocolate cupcake, and a carrot cupcake all of them were DELICIOUS! Seriously most gluten free pastries are horrible but these were great. We will definitely be going there frequently.
other My daughter's 128i BMW was horribly keyed this summer and we found Harvil's through State Farm Insurance. Fred Harvil was very friendly and helpful to work with and we really appreciated his service. She dropped her car off on Monday I believe and she had the car back by Friday. His rates were very good and ended up being lower than we had expected, and what we liked about him is that he was very honest. My daughter had accidentally backed her car into a pole earlier that summer and hadn't gotten it fixed because she kept getting quoted around $500 and couldn't do that, but because Harvil was already going to fix the rest of the car he only charged her $100 to repair the back bumper which was really nice. He also set us up with a rental car for her through Hertz that she was able to leave there at the shop and have them pick up which was great and convenient. All in all, Fred Harvil was very pleasant to work with, timely, and left her car looking like new. Definitely recommend!
other Cummings took over the company that we originally used, and since they have taken over we have had nothing but problems.I haven't seen a single bug in years in my house and as soon as we started using Cummings we've found a bug almost every single day and not just 'bugs' but cockroaches. I called Cummings to ask them about why this was happening and the receptionist was extremely rude saying they didn't do anything wrong. I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. Needless to say I will be finding a new pest control company today.
other I really adore this place. They've got some of the best lentil soup around and all of their chicken dishes have been perfectly seasoned and very, very juicy. I recently got the kabob plate and it came out so tender and juicy it was falling apart on my fork. Their hummus and garlic sauce are both very good as well and the service is quick and friendly. Last time I was in, I noticed they expanded their dining section so the place is a bit bigger now, probably to accommodate the increase in customers from the park-and-ride light rail station right in front of their restaurant.Do yourself the favor. If you're heading on the light rail and feel hunger strike, stop off here and enjoy a nice meal. They have good lunch specials around $7.50 for a full plate with meat, hummus, garlic sauce, pita, and tabouli. Mmmm!
other The hula burger was awesome! Great service. The hostess is very kind and sweet. What a great find!
other I am being generous with my review. I am biased since this place has been one of my favorite restaurants for years. I love it in Georgia and this place continues the tradition of rocking faces off - Italian style. I went to this locale for my birthday party with about 20 friends (unbelievable, I know). This place was more than accommodating. The waitress was fantastic, even though we were a pain in the butt come check time. I took her suggestions for our family style dinner and not one disappointed. I highly recommend the Rigatoni D and Chicken Prosciutto. Both were fantastic entrees. To top it off, we finished out with killer tiramisu. There is nothing bad I can say for this place. The atmosphere is what you would  expect from a large italian restaurant. I personally love that their waiting area is also the bar. That is just good thinking. It truly is a killer place that is perfectly nestled in north Scottsdale. I am in love...
other Got to give them four stars, Above the crowed, cooked to order food here is simply great.Yes butter burger is a fun time but the real mean is their entrees Fried Chicken and Fried Cod, they keep their fries clean and use a great breading recipe,  try it you'll be back for more.The beef is ok, sometimes a little salty.  mixers,not the biggest fan but they hit the spot when you need to.  be creative and make your own mixer.  Service,well its ok, they do bring it to your table and when you do a drive thru don't expect this to be Wendy's, it will take some time depending on what you order.  Your given a number and a nice high school student will bring some food to you.The service seems to be young here, they just like hiring someone looking for their 1st job or so.  No this does not create the best service but creates, our local future.  giving a younger kid a job is not easy to do and these kids will move onto another job and keep working this is good karma for Culver's Phoenix  and shows an investment in the town.  I choose to review this location because it has been around.  I used to go out of my way to find a Culver's.  now they are popping up around town.  As a Midwest person this is great to see.  This is mid west food, comforting a little greasy but dedicated to a great meal.  kevin
other Oh, the hours I wasted at the big chains looking for an affordable framing option for this big print.  Hours from my short life I'll never get back.  Hours I could've been caring for the sick or spreading global warming awareness.  OK, for sure I know I missed at least one Happy Hour because I waited to check Yelp which directed me to Paradise Framing.  They were very helpful showing me different options in my budget, and making sure the frame and matting all coordinated with the print well.  Price was very fair, and they did quick, quality work.  Next time I'm going to Paradise Framing, then straight to Happy Hour - um, social work.
other After writing the review the other day I had a taste for Pappa's. So I went last night and YA-HUMMEE! I tried something new the Hudson platter and this baby did not disappoint! Perfectly grilled scallops, other succulent and sweet lobster tails, other huge shrimp brochette. If you are not familiar with shrimp brochette it is shrimp stuffed with Monterey jack cheese and a sliver of Jalapeno, wrapped in bacon and char -grilled. DELICIOUSNESS! It is served with the fabulous dirty rice and sauteed green beans all for are you ready for this wait for it 22.95! I also indulged in sharing a little pecan sweet potato pie with Hagen daas vanilla ice cream and bourbon sauce. WOOHOO! FYI all deserts purchased until July 26th will have a portion of the proceeds go to a local food bank! Dinner last night was sooo freakin good I may be back tonight! Bon Appetite
3 I met up with a few ladies here for drinks a few weeks back at the suggestion of someone else. We didn't end up playing pool, just enjoyed our drinks at the bar before moving over to a table. We were definitely over dressed and probably out of place, but it was a chill place to let loose. Drinks were okay, food was nothing outstanding, prices were to be expected.
other This place is the white-trash Chipotle. The food is mediocre at best. I mean seriously, how can you just up and steal Chipotle's idea! There's no creativity there. The Habenaro Salsa is flavorless and not hot at all. Seriously? I asked for HOT, not some yellowish tomato concoction for the people who can't handle real salsa!  At least Chipotle has hot salsa (not too hot either but much better) for a fast Americanized mexican food. Of course I much rather have the real deal but I do like Chiptole for what it is. Not this crap that Qdoba tries to serve up. The chicken is over seasoned and highly spiced/herbed you can barely taste the chicken. The Fajita veggie were the same. The product looked of very low quality. Oxidizing Guacamole and Lettuce. The meat looked unappetizing as well. Just not at the level of Chipotle. Although I have been here twice, this is the last time for me. I have been to one in Denver and for some reason thought it was better. So maybe it's management but I can say the food is less than good. I much rather go to Chiptole than this wannabe! Employees were dumber than a bag of Frijoles!This place has the worst "Mexican" Food I have ever had next to a pre made burrito from 7-1other or a burrito from Taco Bell. Just disgusting food.
other This is my favorite Tapas joint in town. It's a place I have to get the same thing everytime and maybe more to try a few new items... my must haves are:Island Gingered Yam & Pumpkin Bisque Soup (Seasonal)... so good and the fact that it's seasonal makes it even more of a special treat.Camarones Al Ajillo (Garlic Shrimp)... this is my all time favoreite dish thus far @ Havana... I can eat it as my meal as long as they provide me as much of their tasty bread as I need to sop the dish dry of all the yummy garlic sauce it contains.Maduras Fritos... Fried plantains... need I say more?Mojito... best in town in terms of authenticity.Marquesas de Chocolate aka Chocolate Pate... I never cared for dessert here until I tasted this strangely named treat. It is so rich at first you think it will be too little but then you realize you need to share with everyone at your table.Other worthy options: Arroz Con Pollo... It has baby peas in it and I really don't like peas... but I like them in this dish! I got to try this dish because a friend ordered it as his meal and didn't even make a dent in it... so I got all the leftovers and it was pretty tasty and economical!Fritoras de Frijoles Negros... I've never had Black Bean Fritters before--they are quite tasty dipped in Guacamole!Calypso Chips...A thinner more chippy version of Fried Plantains.Sun Spots... Sweet Potato Fritters pretty tasty as well... for a fried root vegetable!Datiles Con Chorizo... A meatier appetizer... not the best I've had but pretty darn good.Empanaditas... These are alright... though I'm partial to Filipino style Empanadas... but since I have no place to buy them from, nor have I mastered making them, these are quite good for a band-aid craving.Tamal Cubano... pretty tasty, but my fave is the soupier Salvadorean take on the chicken tamale.Flan... haven't had it, but flan consistency throughout varying cultures seems pretty consistent.Free Goodness: Their Bread! It's just the way I like it, hot, thin and crisp crust and soft in the middle!As you can see, outside of the Arroz Con Pollo, I have not tried many of their entrees... I'm quite content to dine with others and share Havana's wonderful tapas... but one day I WILL try their Paella. A vegetarian friend said they make a veggie paella that was pretty tasty... and she loves their Mojitos just as much as I do so I think she may be right on this one. Can't wait to try it... with a side of Camarones al Ajillo and a Mojito!
other Just got back from lunch here, and I must say it was delicious! We sat outside on the patio which was very nice on such a pretty sunny day. I had the beef gyro which was huge and so so yummy! It came with a fresh greek salad and a yogurt sauce and I couldn't have asked for anything more.Definitely recommend coming here!
other Usually stop here for breakfast and mimosas. Agreed the service is not always the greatest but who expects 5star service at a breakfast/lunch cafe. I say have a mimosa and chill out. They also have a fun drink/beer list. Or fresh squeezed OJ that is worth the trip. The food is bought locally and prepared fresh so the wait is worth the quality. I usually do the omelettes... mushroom garlic. I can't refuse that mushroom sauce!! I have had their huge a#$ burgers and a couple of their sandwiches. The Loki and the vegetarian stand out. What ever you try I don't think you will be disappointed.
other I used to go here at least 3 times a week for Happy hour.  The volcano chicken was my favorite meal.  However, the last time I was in there I had a cricket in my water.  I took a sip squeezed the lemon, and thought there was something wrong with the taste.  I checked and at first thought it was a lemon seed but no, sure enough it was a cricket (in which i took a picture).  The way this restaurant handled an insect in my water was repulsive.  One of the male bartenders came over and brought a new water saying, "It happens."  No, sorry that's disgusting.  If i hadn't been craving the volcano chicken I went there for I would have just left.  And then on top of getting a cricket in my water there's no discount or compensation off of my bill.
other What kind of sports bar doesn't serve SLIDERS??? Nachos, quesadillas, and celery/carrots options but NO SLIDERS??? Guess that just goes hand-in-hand with the NO MALIBU RUM option!! At least the bartender asked me if their fake option was okay first. Hello... no!!!! Wait service was crap after a spring training game as they did not have nearly enough staff to serve people. Had to wait 1other minutes in a booth before anyone acknowledged us. BUZZ KILL!! On the plus side, patio is pretty cool and the pool tables when it's not a busy time!
other Great food as always.  The owner is incredibly professional, friendly and charismatic;came buy three times to check in on experience and even asked if we wanted more antipasto salad items(on an already generous, well-priced portion.)  The service is great.  Homemade breads.  Extremely generous portions.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to all.
other Who doesn't like a good carne asada burrito? No one doesn't that's who. It's rudunk
other Went here for the first time for xmas dinner.  Atmosphere was very chill.  Almost felt mafiosa style at times. It is a mellow setting and very relaxing with unique music.  They also have TONS of sports related everything to keep you're eyes busy while you're enjoying your meal.  Our server was awesome, we got our food very fast and everything was excellent.  I recommend getting the 12oz filet.  It was right up there with other top shelf steak houses in the area and reasonably priced.We will definitely be going back to Don and Charlies.
other I saw this place on a Food Network series in November. When my family went to Phoenix in March for spring training, I knew we had to stop here. It was the first stop after getting off the plane and getting the rental car. It was in a sketchy area in the town, and far enough from the freeway. When we were there, the workers gave us samples of the different foods. I got the chicken fried rice combo with jade red chicken and the pollo diablo. The pollo diablo had a nice spicy flavor, and the jade red chicken was also very good. The snickerdoodle was very soft and chewy, which was a good thing for me. This will be a permanent stop in Phoenix for Spring Training trips.
other Gotta love a place open late in Phoenix. 2.50 petite martinis after midnite; yes please!
other i used to come here all the time with my family, right after work we'd head over here for some delicious pizza and AMAZING salad! Pablo Picasso Mexico Salad. was sent from heaven, one thing. I haven't actually had it since I became vegetarian a couple months ago, but the salad without chicken would not be a miss!! You may be curious to know why we haven't been here in so long, well just ONCE we saw a cockroach on the wall that grossed us out, and that's why this place loses a star. Other than that, I recommend it without a doubt. Thin crust pizza is way better than the deep dish here!
other I have always loved this place.   Good Food, fair price,  and typically a couple of cute girls working there.  All around good place..   its a go to .
other This place has the oiliest food I've ever eaten in my life.  I had carry out one evening (two dishes) and the entrees were soaked in oil.  I had to rinse with water my eggplant dish three times just to eat it without feeling sick to my stomach.  I wish I could've washed the other dish too (but it wasn't one that could be washed--it was a wide-rice noodle dish).Can definitely taste the MSG in these dishes too.Really not sure what the fuss is about.
other This place came recommended by the hotel and some colleagues in Phoenix so my expectations were high.I went with the recommendation of the waiter and chose the salmon -- mistake.  It was dried up and had zero flavor.  The potatoes and asparagus that accompanied the dish however were cooked perfectly.  I also had the wedge salad to start, which was more like two mini-wedges.  Great presentation on the salad, but sort of strange with 1/other a devil's  egg in the middle of the plate.  Good but strange and a little too small with the portion size.  After all, iceberg lettuce is cheap.  The waiter was attentive and staff were all nice.  Not sure I would ever go back.
3 My parents love pho so I've practically been enjoying Vietnamese cuisine since the womb. Ha! No wonder I love it so much myself that it was always on the weekly dinner rotation when I lived in OC. Alas, I moved to North Phoenix and I dont have little pho shops or boba cafes on every street corner. I've learned that I have to drive a ways to Chandler/Mesa to satisfy these cravings. Imagine my surprise when the husband and I noticed Tea Lite Cafe when we changed up our movie theater location this past weekend. Of course, we had to try it out and we'd been dying for some pho for months now.We both ordered the beef pho and took a seat. The place is small but there's plenty of seating and still feels spacious. The cashier up front was super friendly and welcoming which was nice. We didn't have to wait too long for our food to arrive...another plus. The pho itself has really tasty broth and the beef was nice and tender. I was disappointed by the small portion of bean sprouts, mint leaves and limes that accompanied the soup. I'm used to overflowing plates of these veggies so I can load up my soup to my heart's desire. In fact, my hubby usually counts on me doing this since I end up eating all my veggies and leaving most of the beef for him. Double ha! But the lack of sprouts and mint leaves didn't put a damper on the great taste of the pho. What I did miss was the traditional pho ingredients like tripe, rare steak and tendons. I know, I know...sounds intense but trust me it makes pho taste soooo good. I guess I just have a usual when it comes to pho so I was a little disappointed when I couldn't satisfy my craving to the utmost degree. Woe is me. But let me conclude by stating again that the pho here is really good and has a great flavor to the broth. I think the hubby and I will go back since it is so conveniently located to us. It'll definitely do in a pinch although I am sure I will occasionally find myself making the trek to get me some tripe!
other We ate there last night and were very pleased our meals and service.  The ribs were especially good.  We would go back again.
other Lee's Sandwiches has always been a pleasant place to go since it opened in Chandler years ago. From what I remember it was cheap and delicious. When I went back today, I found it to be cheap in a different way, as well.I ordered the #17 (Jambon and Pork) on a croissant and a large thai iced tea with no ice. other items, $9. Not quite the Lee's I remembered. They called my number and I walked up to get my food. Croissant sandwich, check. No ice in my drink, check. Thai iced tea...half check. My large cup was only half full (not being optimistic). Quite literally half full. I picked up my cup and asked where the rest of my drink was and was told that I ordered no ice (well duh). I told him I didn't order "no drink" and he said he wouldn't give me what I paid for.Very very disappointed. The only thing that saved Lee's from other star was the delicious sandwich.Food - other starsCustomer service - no stars
other Yes... I love Eegee's... I have to admit it could be a bit of a problem for me as I drove from Chandler to Casa Grande just for an eegee and sammich in the worse rush hour traffic. If that isn't love I don't know what is because we all know Arizona drivers are ... well you know. I always get the pina colda mixed with lemon eegee and a grinder / or turkey sub and don't forget the ranch fries! The one is Casa Grande is new and clean not that I can say the same for the ones in Tucson.
other Who woulda thunkkkk Scottsdale, AZ would have such amazing soul food??! They surprised the hell outta me!Coming from someone who regulars Roscoes chicken &waffles... believe me when I say LOLO's is BOMB!!! I got the 3chicken combo... w greens, mac&cheese &cornbread. Cornbread.. hands down Roscoes!Greens... RoscoesMac&cheese... LOLOs for suuuree!Chicken... tied.. they're both really good!the staff is super friendly!! can't wait to go back when i visit AZ. (=
other I really don't consider myself a Neiman's type of girl...As a matter of fact, I don't really feel comfortable in Neiman's - it's extremely 'fancy' and high end for me.  But, I've gone in a handful of times and even bought a dress or two on sale at Neiman's in the past.  I admit, the quality associated with the designer labels at this store is pretty amazing.Anyways, I felt some major pressure to register at Neiman's from my mom, so I met my mother-in-law-to-be at this Neiman's location on Sunday.  The housewares / registry department is extremely small... and although the woman working was sweet, she botched the spelling of Jared's name in the process.  Needless to say, i was not so impressed.Fancy sums this department store up in my eyes - I'm much more of a Nordstrom's or Macy's or Bloomingdales type of girl!
other EXCELLENT TRIP TO THE SPA!!!!! A trip to the Aji Spa (located at the Sheraton Wildhorse Pass Resort and Spa) was at the top of my list during my recent trip to Arizona on Memorial Day Weekend. We made our reservations well in advance. Having gone to a few spa resorts, I couldn't wait to pay this one a visit. My cousin and I were each booked for the Little Yellow Bird spa package, which was comprised of other services each. We arrived about 1other minutes prior to our appointment time and was given a tour of the spa. After changing in the women's locker room, and relaxing in the private women's lounge area (there's a large lounge area, but it's co-ed), our masseuses met us and brought us into our room. My cousin and I decided for our first service to be the Companion Massage. After only having solo massages, I was interested how a companion massage differed. The 50 minute Aji Massage flew by. My masseuse was professional and the massage given was very comfortable, relaxing and beneficial. After our massages were completed, we had some time in between our next service, feeling a little hungry, we decided to grab some lunch from the spa's cafe. I ordered the flatbread pizza and it was TO DIE FOR! Seeded flatbread topped off with a garlic peppery aioli, grilled chicken pieces, pesto sauce, marinated bell peppers, melted cheese and avocado. My visit was a month and a half ago and my memory, a little fuzzy, but that was one of the best lunches I've had in a long time!! After lunch sometime, we each were up for our second service, our facials!!! Due to my skin type, I received the Aji Rain Facial. My esthetician was wonderful! Her hands were soft and gentle while working on my face and we had some lovely conversation during the 50 minute procedure. I left that room with my face feeling renewed, clean and fresh!All spa treatments include full use of the spa's facilities so we definitely made well use of that! After our facials, we used the sauna (the steam room was out of service during our visit) and whirlpools located on the women's locker side. We then relaxed and lounged by the outside pool. The Aji Spa is such a calm, warm and relaxing environment that I ended up taking a nap! Outside! In desert heat! Thank goodness for the wooden awning with misters attached and the huge patio umbrellas providing shade! The staff at the spa provided excellent service! From the front desk, to our masseuse, the esthetician, the cafe staff and the locker room attendant! While napping, one of the staff from the cafe even brought us iced water with lemon and cucumber slices in it!Our appointment started at 12pm and with our other procedures, and lunch, we should have been done and out of there within a few hours. But the point of visiting the spa was to relax, and with Aji Spa being such a lovely place, we just didn't want to leave!  We finally left nearly 8 hours after our arrival, and we would have stayed longer if we could! I highly recommend Aji Spa to anyone visiting the Phoenix area, or if you're looking for a new spa to travel to! Aji Spa is a beautiful spa with excellent staff and service. They even emailed me the same day of my service as a "Thank You" for visiting and included a discount coupon on my next visit! A 5-star spa, indeed!
other Ok, technically this is not Mexican food, it's spanish and puerto rican food, but has a lot of the same kinds of spices and is WAY, WAY, WAY good.first off, they have plaintains, which look like bananas, but taste like potatoes. if you've never had them, try them here, yum! this is definitely the place to go with a big group of peole and share a few different dishes. good luck, because the menu is HUGE. the dessert menu alone has two dozen items!seafood like ceviche and paella (supposed to be to die for), tapas, tamales, soup, salads, egg dishes (not breakfast),...the list goes on and on and that's just lunch!plates top off around $1other for the most expensive for lunch, but you can easily make a meal out of two apps.the mojito is their specialty, and they have i think a dozen rums to choose from, along with sangria. on the last monday of the month, every bottle of spanish wine is half off- you cork it if you don't finish it. i can't give this rest. a more glowing recommendation!
other Cheap!  Cheap!  Beware!  If you order Chicken McNuggets from this McDonald's they will charge you 10 cents for each sauce packet over the alloted quantity.  Either go to another McDonald's where they don't charge, go to another restaurant that values your business and NOT nickel and dime you to death or don't eat!
other I love this place. My gf and I go every time we visit her parents in north scottsdale. Pro'squick and easy. good service. clean. good food. good management. not too expensive. they also post nutrition info on their menu (that alone is laudable). cons,the salad dressing is quite sharp.
other Went here on a Sunday night to celebrate a friends birthday.  Glad we made reservations as even on a Sunday night, it was a packed house.  Here is what I liked:*The food, appetizers, pasta dishes and warm bread (and the tomato/bruschetta like topping they give you with it).*The fact the owner/chef is present and wants to ensure you enjoy your meal.  *Good location, plenty of parking.  *Value, prices are in line with what I would expect to pay for the quality and type of food you get.  Here is what was just OK:*Service, our server was nice enough but he got distracted chatting with other employees and customers and often forgot to check back with us to refill waters, remove dirty dishes, etc.  On the plus side, he knew the menu and made excellent recommendations.*Atmosphere, I know they are doing the best with the building they have to work with but I felt a bit like I was in a remodeled pancake house trying to be an Italian restaurant.   The one exception would be the bar area which was more elegant/traditional.  *The deserts, we had several and I would say mediocre on all maybe even bland.  That being said, however, every other part of the meal was delicious.
other ...for selling broccoli at a good price I gave them a chance....for selling celery that was already rotting I won't do so again.
other Boy is the name a temptation.Seriously :)  I'll try to be fair though but I'm writing at a time were this restaurant was truly life changing. So much so that I'm buying a dining room table, additional gear for the kitchen and not frequenting any chain while I'm in my hometown based on the strength of this experience. Even in a good mood this place wouldn't be breaking a 2.other . I'm not in a good mood.  Texas cheese fries. Pretty tasteless,mess of uncrisp steak fries that are meant to be Monterrey jack , cheddar and bacon. Either the cheese mixed itself together really well or that's not what I had. Bacon , mm that is a very generous term for the toe nail clippings of meat that ended up atop it. Saving grace was only ordering 1/other an order.Kid's meal.  Holy crap dried and scraggly carrots accompanied the most basic hot dog imaginable on the most generic bun. No refill offered this time on drink, no straw either.   By far the most cynical  kid's meal I've met. Sure make a profit but don't take the piss!  Fresh carrots are not hard to do , with white film on them.. sorry you've just earned a  other star. Should have walked out, didn't. :( Entrees.Cajun steak . Claims to be marinated in spices that I couldn't find. They may indeed have shown them a picture of the process in the recipe but I couldn't find it. Meant to be medium rare but was medium on one side , rare on the other, close though:) Sirloin steak. Cooked as requested , a bit over seasoned. Sides: Twice baked potato.  If you ever want to open up a salt mine these guy will do it for you. You want an idea of what it's texture was?  Twice chewed would be a better name. Warm vomit with bacon bits would be  a slightly more colorful, and chunky, term.Fried onions:   came with whatever was stuck to the grill they came from.The mushrooms were the only thing that were as tasteful as expected. They looked very consistent though,  canned?   Never mind they were edible: Steak soup,really more a stew,but tasted pretty good.  Overall service was ok'ish but walking the kid to the toilet twice the staff just seemed  to want to get to where they wanted to go and not care for the toddler walking up the aisle to the restroom in front of me.  ( that's for this occasion only , past two times it's been great fun for the kid,)1.other rounded to other for the carrots.
other My husband and i went here for our 2nd wedding anniversary..We wanted to goto some place that was romantic, quiet and served gr8 food & drinks...We were so glad we came to Chritophers..The food & drinks are expenesive but you get what you pay for...The food was gr8..We ordered escagort ( snails ) , seafood and a duck dish...Tasted really good and so did the wine..I will recommend this place for special occassions..You will not be disappointed !!
3 Its been a few weeks since I've eaten here..but its only now that I have time to write this long, overdue review.Hm...its upscale...kind of comparable to Mikuni's in Sac...but their menu is to some extent, smaller and less tasty.  I don't recall exactly what i ordered but...I wouldn't recommend this place to friends.  It was okay, nothing that stood out...and trust me, food, when its good...it sticks with me.  :)  Without further a due, edible but i would never crave for it again.
other I'm huge fan of this place. Its tough for me and my wife to Love this place due to the Gilty feeling of bad eating we get after visiting this establishment. The food is Outstanding and I've liked everything except the Catfish fried. My wife enjoys the catfish, but I think its lacking flavor, however they fry it to a cripy golden brown crust. I could just eat the crust and forget the fish. We've been twice now and I'm sad to say that we pretty much ordered the same things twice. The garlic parmesan wings and honey habenero wings are our favorites (of course we haven't tried any others, so take it with a grain of salt) catfish, corn nuggets, fried okra, french fries, and coleslaw. And to finish it all off...the best Biscuits of all time, if you consider a biscuit a French dougnut.(beignet) a biscuit. Seriously the best thing ever, but you feel pretty guilty afterwards. My recommendation is to hit the gym prior to going so you don't feel so guilty! But what ever you do, GO......
other Not a bad theater. The staff is friendly and the sound is ok.
other I've been planning a visit to the Public Market for some time now, and was downtown today so I finally stopped in for lunch.  I had the "Friggin Chicken", which was friggin delicious.  The market fare is counter service, but when I was ordering the cashier was very friendly and courteous and brought my food to me out on the patio.This was a very pleasant first experience, sitting on the patio reading a book, sipping my canned mint green tea, and eating my sandwich with a side of couscous.  The atmosphere was very relaxed and there were others nearby sharing a bottle of wine, or just finishing up their lunch with good conversation.  Speaking of the wine, there was an impressive wine and craft beer selection.  I'll be going back to sample the beverages very soon.On my way out, I stopped at the coffee bar for a latte, which was much more bold and flavorful than your "Fast Food Coffee" variety; a great way to finish off my lunch.  If you're looking for a quick, inexpensive, fresh and local dining experience, check this place out.
other I first visited this restaurant after my friend pushed me to visit the Hawaiian festival at the Tempe Town Lake a few months ago."Big deal," I thought. "How can a Hawaiian festival be fun?"Well, the food was amazing. And after having half a rotisserie chicken, I was craving for more.A few days later, I finally began my search for the perfect (or near perfect) Hawaiian restaurant, in which I can satisfy my Hawaiian cravings.My first stop was Mai Island Grill, located in/near the Arizona State University campus. Parking was a bit of a challenge; this is especially true during the lunch hour.When I finally found a parking spot, I went in and ordered. I had the short ribs plate. The plates include one scoop of macaroni salad and steamed rice.After placing my order for the short ribs, I ordered the Spam musubi.The guy preparing food replied with a laugh."Is it good?" I askedJay -- the man who operates this restaurant -- replied, "Yes it's good." Then he said something about how the guy who laughs never laughs (or something like that).About 10 minutes later, my food was ready.The food was fantastic; just what I was looking for!The prices are very reasonable. Plates are about $10 and less.I also suggest that you try the fish, beef, grilled chicken, and pork katsu.And finally, I hope that this place continues to provide the same liberal portions. Also, I think it would be cool if Mai Island Grill began serving two scoops of macaroni salad and two scoops of rice (just a fantasy of mine).Additional Notes:- Cash Only.- Opens late in the morning and closes early in the afternoon (call for exact hours).- There never seems to be any "Lumpia!" :-/
other Had some time to kill before the Ultimate pleY Date Yelp event, and I'd wanted to share my love of Nobuo's Dark chocolate mousse with green tea ice cream and sugared orange peels with my happy-go-lucky cousin, who has never been here before, so we stopped by at 5:17p to find that Nobuo wouldn't open till 5:30p, so we waited outside in the comfortable patio.After watching a couple of employees add lanterns to their outdoor umbrellaed tables, I noticed the "OPEN" sign on the front door, so we entered the resto, whereupon we were greeted warmly by a male host and shown to a two-top.  I didn't like the energy in that room, so I asked if we could sit elsewhere, and he said to choose wherever we wanted to sit.  We were the first customers, so we chose a four-top, knowing we wouldn't be taking up space for very long, anyway.  Glasses of water were delivered, and soon we met our female server (whose name on the receipt reflected "Butai").  When she laid down the menus, I told her we would only be having dessert and could we see the dessert menu?  I wished we had a video of the look she gave us, a look of pure distaste, as she gathered up the dinner and beverage menus and said "We don't have dessert menus, as we only have two..." and proceeded to tell us of the mousse and the almond-orange fritters.  She walked away, and as we loudly discussed about our losing our interest in dining there, she came back with napkins and utensils and asked if we decided what we were going to have.  I decided to forgo our server's very cold treatment and asked for the mousse.  After all, I'd already finished a glass of ice-cold water and cousin's phone needed recharging...  When Butai placed our chocolate mousse http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg#rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg on the table, I wanted to send it back.  Where was the lovely bowl and presentation of the last dessert I had here?  Was she serious in presenting us with this stale-looking mousse, with cracked edges and whose green tea ice cream had ice crystals on it?  I don't know about you, but the only times I've seen crystals on ice cream is when it has slightly melted and placed back in the freezer to re-freeze.  For me, seeing crystals on ice cream is a sign that it is old...  I brought the receptacle and showed it to the male host, who assured me that all of the mousse is made daily at 4:00a and seeing cracks and bubbles in the mousse is normal, so I decided we would go ahead and try it, if for nothing else but to have something to report here.  The dessert was definitely not up to par with the pretty bowl http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ#o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ I had during our October OYE in taste and presentation, but it was OK.  The mousse was still cold and stiff, and it had a mouth-feel more of like thick chocolate ganache filling/icing on a cake- certainly not the silky-smooth chocolate decadence I knew it could be.  My cousin had to warm up to the dish, as the sound of chocolate and green tea together didn't seem like a great combo to her (I told her to trust me).  She also never enjoyed orange and chocolate together, but she liked it in this dessert.  I understand that the knowledge of having to serve only dessert instead of dinner AND dessert, which translates to a higher table bill, can be a bit of a disappointment, but why must you show your displeasure to your guests?  Butai, you were lucky that my cousin even left you the change for a tip- she didn't want to give you anything, and you certainly didn't deserve it!  When I told other Yelp friends about the sub-par service and dessert we just had, one replied she didn't enjoy the last time we had apps here (I think it was around Halloween and First Friday?) either.  Cousin and I thought it very poor taste that our server gave us that awful, condescending look after finding out we were just going to have dessert; We didn't deserve that!  I am never going to recommend Nobuo to anyone, anymore.  I even promised my Japanese friend (who lives and works overseas) I'd treat her to a dining experience here when she comes to visit.  Guess I'll have to find another place to take her...  I don't want to risk getting the same treatment from Butai, or from another server should we come back here.  Sorry, Nobuo, but I won't be returning.
other I had high hopes for the Habit since I live only a couple miles away, but it was mostly disappointing for me.  I'm vegetarian, so I have no idea how their meat burgers taste, and they may be the best in the world for all I know, but the veggie burger was a tasteless lump for the most part.  I do give them kudos for having a veggie burger, but either put more effort into it, or take it off the menu and go full-on meat!The service was nice, and I like the design of the place, but there are too many good veggie burgers to be had in the Valley to waste my time eating this one.  Parking lot is super-cramped, so if you need your meatburger fix, then don't come right at 1other or 6, unless you want to park in someone's yard.
other I went here for a birthday party it was a group of 9 and everyone got good service. It was good in taste but more expensive than some of the ones that were closer to me in Mesa. I would go back but only as a group. If you are closer to this place than say Sushi Ave go here you wont be dissappointed.
other As I passed the velvet rope flanked by shiny, exotic cars I knew I was in for an experience.  Some might call it a fine-dining experience, but clearly this was something more.  A tribute to opulence and Regan-era excess, Dominick's is your seven-figure foodie fantasy come alive; from the moment you enter the swanky foyer to the gleaming 10 inch tower of tiramisu that finishes your meal.  It's glittery, bedazzled, and oozing pretension - and I loved it.The ServiceMy visit to Dominick's was the night after it's official opening.  The service tried very hard to be as impeccable as the surroundings and, while not perfect, the charming staff and the sincere effort put forth made little things like missing napkins and bread plates instantly forgivable.  Our server, Drew, let us know that the wait staff only had other - 3 tables each and it was very evident in the personal service we received.  A few more weeks of experience for the staff should easily iron out the little wrinkles.The FoodWe started with the jumbo shrimp appetizer, which unfortunately came with 3 shrimp - hardly conducive to sharing - so we ordered two. And "Jumbo" they certainly were, accompanied by a kicky cocktail sauce which my dinner companion felt was spicy enough.  Ever the daredevil, I added additional horseradish to mine because who doesn't like to burn the inside of their nostrils at dinner.For the main course we both had the 9-oz filet, lobster gnocchi and steamed asparagus.  My filet was a perfect rare-plus with a dark pink center, expertly seared and juicy.Surprisingly the lobster gnocchi really stole the show for me.  I'm not big on starches or cream sauces so when it was suggested I wasn't particularly excited; I should have been.  The dough was light and fluffy, the cream sauce not too rich and the lobster added the perfect amount of salt & texture.After dinner I indulged in a grand marnier while my companion ordered the tiramisu.  He was presented with a 10 inch tall hunk of cake that could easily have been intended for other people.  The tiramisu was spongy and light, with a lovely cool custard and only a subtle flavor of rum.  A nice finish to an excellent meal.  AtmosphereWe were lucky enough to score a poolside table which started off as very romantic but over the course of the evening became quite the place for people watching.  The scene at the small bar area on the 2nd floor was bustling and both the waiters and I wondered aloud how long it would be before a guest fell in the pool.  I bet they didn't make it through the weekend without someone making a splash.
other Three cheers to Yelp for helping me find where in the Valley to go for real beef jerky!  The fresh stuff which has more beef than chemicals.  (The convenience store packages just were not doing it for me!) After checking out the website, I emailed good friends in Las Vegas (who used to live in Minnesota), asking if they were familiar with Von Hanson's.  (They have 2other locations in Minnesota - and ONE in Chandler.)My roommate and I went on July 2. They were running a special for NY strips - buy one, get one free - so that was added to the plan in addition to the jerky.SCORE!  We picked up a half pound each of the peppered jerky and the cajun spicy.  $18/lb.  The NY strips were (if memory serves...) $14.99/lb, and the steaks were averaging a little over 3/other lb - so super yay for the BOGO sale - it brought the meat down to regular grocery prices. I have to say - the quality of the meat is amazing!  Just looking at the cuts in the display case, I can declare Von Hanson's makes AJ's look like Fry's!  These were GORGEOUS!  Quite possibly the prettiest steaks I've ever seen!I also grabbed a couple pigs ears for my dog, and the roommate picked up a package of her favorite kind of sausage (linguisa).Admittedly, I am not a sausage expert.  Plus, I live very close to Schreiner's - so while I would have no problem buying sausage from Von Hanson's, I wouldn't make the hike to Chandler just for those.  The selection was quite impressive, though!Overall - this place has everything for carnivorial happiness!  (Hey - if you understood the context, it's a word, right?)  Great selection of beef, chicken and pork products.  Tons of spices, sauces, rubs and marinades.  Nice selection of unique beer and wines.  Fridge and freezer cases with more meats, sides, and desserts! Yes, it's pricey - but the quality is certainly there to justify it.Once home, we grilled up the steaks using our favorite rub.  OMG amazing meat!  Probably the best steak I've had in YEARS - and NY strip isn't even my cut of choice!The peppered beef jerky is full of YUM - and this is so strange to write - but the Cajun is a bit spicy for my taste.  (And I adore spicy!)  It's amazingly good, and addictive - but almost requires a cold beer to go along with it to help cut the heat.The Vegas via Minnesota friends emailed back Monday - they know Von Hanson's quite well - and are grateful there isn't one in Vegas - it would KILL the weekly grocery budget with how often they'd be in!  They love, love, LOVE the place - and I am now under strict orders to bring them care packages from here whenever I come up to visit!Oh - and Layla (my pooch) was pretty stoked about the pig ears - so in addition to my five stars, please add two paws up!  (I didn't tell her they have a whole dog food and treat section - I am on a budget, after all!)
other So now I've been to two Ski Pros in the Valley and I'm pleasantly please with both of them when it comes to their merchandise. I haven't rented from them yet, but if their selection of clothing has anything to say about what they offer then I approve! From Spyder, to North Face to Columbia, they have everything to choose from. The ski clothes are adorable and trendy. And the best part? The sales! They have a continuous sale going on it feels like, and the rumor on the street is that a huge sale is coming in February. Count me in!
other After repeat visits it just gets worse - the service, that is.  It was as if we were held hostage and could not leave for a full 2other minutes because that's how long it took to receive hour check after several requests to several different employees.  Female servers might be somewhat cute but know absolutely nothing about beer and this is a brewpub.  I asked if they have an seasonal beers and the reply was no, that they only sell their own beers!  Even more amusing is their "industrial pale ale" is an IPA but it is not bitter.  So, they say it's an IPA but it's not bitter, it's not a true-to-style IPA.  Then people say "Oh I don't like IPA's" and want something else.  Their attempt to rename a beer/style is actually hurting them.  Amazing.The menu was not the regular menu, just a small list of about 4-other choices.  To make it worse, the actual menu on every table was wrong, yet the kept the menus on the tables anyway.  I heard 3 separate tables order the fried raviolis but they did not have them.  This place is *only* in business because of the location, location, location.
other Tried this place for the first time and had the chicken pho and and mongolian beef with red rice. All was delicious...but I especially loved their red rice, it was spicy and soooo good. Everything is very reasonably priced and you can even get it delivered from a service called You Buy and We Fly!!
other Great Brisket. There has not been good BBQ in south Scottsdale for a long time. There is now!. The food is wonderful and priced well. Stop in and grab a bite.
other I hate to give this place other star but my recent experiences were horrible. I use to dine at this restaurant often with my family. The more we go, service decreased. Our water cups never get filled.The very last time I was there, I found a gnat in my pho. Although I have eaten about 50% of the medicore pho, they asked if I wanted another bowl. I said no; I was there on my lunch break. No time to wait for another bowl. I got up to pay for my bill and to my surprise, there was no discount or any sort of accommodation. I am disappointed with them and will not be back.
other Suffered a senior moment today! Did the yelp check and thought this sounds good...the drive was very dejavu and then I discovered why....see previous review! lol .....but to update....the volcano appetizer, sedona roll and Mochi Icecream (which I am becoming addicted to) were all wonderful. Our waitress was also fantastic bringing plenty of their delicious iced tea and keeping the ginger bowl full....a necessity for me. The place was full tonight and I can see why. Question is will I remember?
other Beaver Choice is an excellent place which I have had the chance to visit three or four times.  This is about as home-cooked as you can get in a restaurant.  It's like eating at Mom's house, if Mom happens to be Swedish.I've had a few of the entrees -- schnitzel cordon bleu, pork medallions, seared gravlax -- and all were delicious.  Especially the gravlax.The sides are also great, and you usually get three per meal.The poutine is perhaps not as good as what you'd get in Quebec, but it's easily the best I've had in Arizona.  The fact that they even have poutine wins this place a few points.I have also had the opportunity to try their dessert specialty, the Beaver Supreme.  This mess of chocolate, meringue, cream, mandarin orange, and possibly a few other things, is the sort of thing which you set out intending to only eat half in the first sitting, but ultimately find your free will diminished, invariably resulting in an empty dish and a fear of the onset of diabetes.Also, it seems one gentleman gave this place low marks for the long preparation time on a chicken wrap.  I just have to ask, why would anyone go to a Scandinavian restaurant and order a chicken wrap?  Can you imagine what would happen if you wander into a Viking camp and order a chicken wrap?  Your head would be off before you could recite one measly Odinian incantation.
other Food was ok. Servers ok but cashier was horrible! Ok, some people are just not meant to work in the food industry. At least smile! Place had a very gross smell! At first we thought maybe because we were sitting kinda close to the restrooms but the farther we moved from there the worst the smell got! Maybe if I'm desperate enough I will go back!
3 Was an interesting way to spend an hour.  Lots of displays but very dusty on the inside of the cases.  Quite and peaceful; a nice place to hang out for awhile.  I showed up about 40 minutes before closing and she didn't charge me the $other but I donated $3 since they operate only on donations.  The table set with rocks and minerals was fun to check out.  I would go back again when I wasn't short on time and explore upstairs.
other This place has exceptional food and pretty great service for how busy it always is.I like it because there are quite a few vegetarian options.  Before I started my vegetarian kick the Baked wings were some of the best wings I have had anywhere.Try:- Mushroom Party Pizza- Roasted Corn Pizza- Baked Wings- Red Velvet CakeOnly con is the parking is kinda crazy.
3 Yes, I've shopped here.  DIRTY as expected, maybe it didn't start as a Big Lots.  Service is hit and miss and usually they're great at helping.  Sometimes when asking for a reduction on damaged items, it's a good answer from a rare on the ball, positive employee.  Other times, even though it's up to the manager, the clerk is crying with a such a dirty glare that you can hear them thinking "you cheap xxx", that it's already reduced (on clearance).  It's still damaged so what's your beef w/wanting a little more discount?  What?  We don't need no stinkin' discount on the discount???
other Unfortunately I don't get enough chances to come here but, I'd say I have been here about a dozen times and each time I have never been let down.  The beer is great, the food is great, especially their french fries and the crowd is OK.  Yes it is in Tempe and you're stuck with all the ASU kids but I like to come here in the summer time or when ASU is on break because it is the locals that are here.  It is not the nicest brewery that I have ever been to, but what they lack in aesthetics they make up for in beer.  A must go to place if you're in the Tempe area!
3 Meh, I'm not completely sold.It's so much smaller than a traditional B&N and they did not have anything I was looking for. Nevermind any of the school related supplies I would have like to seen.I don't think I'll come back here, I'll make my way to Borders (yada yada as you will). I won't be going to the next nearest B&N (Tempe) because I don't have a car and the energy just isn't worth it.
other They're really slipping now.  With dinner, you get cole slaw - you can "upgrade" to soup or salad for 2.50 more.  Really?  I've never heard of cole slaw being a pre-meal before.  I got the French Onion Soup, its actually better at Mimi's.  They put way too much cheese, the bread is pathetic and there's hardly any onions in it.The prime rib comes with horseradish - very weak and cut with butter.  Never heard of that before either.  Luckily I had some sour cream with my baked potato and I asked for some raw horseradish so I can concoct my own.  Wasn't the best, but way better than the butter!  The barbeque chicken was ok.  I've had better at diners.  They didn't really season the bird, just threw some barbeque sauce on it.  At least it wasn't terribly dry...I don't think I'm coming back to this one.  Nooooo..
3 * other stars for uniqueness - This place has very interesting food and flavors that aren't common around here.* other stars for the staff - Everybody was very fast and friendly.* other stars for coolness of the location and the establishment - I mean it is pretty cool that this place is in a nicely redone 100-year-old house in a cool part of downtown Phoenix.  Parking is a pain though.However.....Besides feeling hip, cool, urban and trendy; I also felt hungry and ripped off after leaving.  Sure, I could sit there for hours sipping saki and trying every one of their tapas and probably be ok hunger-wise but  I would NOT be ok with the $100+ tab per person that it would surely be.  For me this is more of a fun/interesting place to go before you go out to dinner.
other I always enjoyed coming here after a long night of work. The staff is amazingly friendly and always made my time here great.The sliders are yummy and their appetizer platter they offer is great. You can choose between a variety of different munchies. Over all I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a low key, bar atmosphere.
other I wish they had a "0" star option too!The service and food was awful. Just a bunch of kids running the place.  The place closes at 10pm but when we went in there at 8pm all the workers were too busy cleaning to go home early to help us.  The food was burnt  on one side and raw on the other. The manager was too busy flirting with the other help. We couldn't get drinks because all the glasses where dirty, we were told by our waitress. We asked for the manager before we left at 8:4other and was told he already went home for the evening. What kind of manager leaves a bunch of teenager to run the place? NEVER GOING BACK!!!!
other Totally a locals hangout.This very unpretentious wine bar is a favorite.  The owner, Darlene, has a great selection of wines from smaller labels for you to try.  If you're not sure what to get they'll help you find a bottle in your price range.  They've got the cheap stuff all the way to the $80+ range (if you feel like spending some money).You can buy a bottle at retail, open it up at their bar and enjoy it with a nosh.  Lots of smaller appetizers (cheese and crackers, etc).  Or, order by the glass/flight from their bar.Checkout their website before you go.  Or if you live in the area, subscribe to their email newsletter.  There is something different going on every day (live music, tastings, specials, etc.)
other Remember how I said that the Trivia was the best thing about this place?  Well, they got rid of long time Triva host, Dave (who had been featured in the College Times and was the best thing about the trivia).  Without Dave's personality, this place just doesn't cut it.  Will never go here again. Bummer.
other Avoid at all costs. Awful service, slow as hell, only uses disposable plasticware/plates to add landfill insult to heinous food.  Despite telling them we were in a rush to catch a plane and multiple reassurances that the food would arrive in plenty of time, they lollygagged around and I ended up paying $30 to be seriously pissed off and hungry with no food.   BLECH.
other I don't usually review based on one visit.  But when the experience and food is as bad as this, I'll make an exception...This place gets two stars for the multiple big screen TVs.  If you're here strictly to watch sports and have a beer or three,  you'll be fairly happy.  However, I came here for a bite to eat, and that's when there where I ran into problems.The bartenders are a disgruntled lot.  Their sour mood when I sat down set the tone for my whole experience here.  They're not all bad.  One of the male bartenders actually smiled occasionally and chatted with some of  the customers.The food.  How can you screw up cole slaw?  What more can I say? Beyond that, if you're in the area to watch a game, this isn't a bad choice.  Just swing by McDonald's or somewhere else for dinner.
other There is only one reason  why I shouldn't love this pizza.Waiting an OBSCENE amount of time for a pizza is a pretty big one. If this pizza was not as good I would be angry I think.I would tell you about it ( HERE)... but you know what its that good. I have had pizza around the world ,its not the best..... but this is pretty close to the best you are going to get in this area code. I would love to say don't believe  "the hype" but yo there is a reason you have to wait sometimes as long as 4+ hours for a pizza on a Saturday night. Lets really face the reality of that night though. You are gonna want to hang  around at other bars drinking with your friends anyway.Its certainly not going to be a cheaper night of entertainment either.. Armed with that information you know what to expect. While there is another place close by that is just as good but not as central.This is worth it just to know what people are talking about.This Pizza is wood fired and made with world class ingredients. The thin cust is perfect. The service at least for me was rushed and sorta unplesant. We were literally the last people in there by the time they sat us, so I am not sure if that behavior / treatment is normal. Not a place to pop in and grab a bite to eat with a small group but if you are REALLY not in rush then this place is one of the best in AZ.
other I think chef Silvana Esparza first located the restaurant here on CALLE DIECISEIS (she renamed the street all by herself, apparently) to take advantage of cheap rent.  There was no way she was going to locate her Scottsdalish restaurant actually in Scottsdale.  So, people from the wealthier areas - and some First Friday urban hipsters whose parents foot their bills - make the trek down to CALLE DIECISEIS to partake in everything Barrio Cafe.  And they think it's cool that they are going there, past the check cashing places, the people waiting at the bus stops and the "rawness" of this part of central Phoenix.And what is everything "Barrio Cafe"????Pretentious service.LOUD dining room.NO parking.Fusion food that is about 10 years past its prime.High prices.Let's talk a little about the last item on the list.Besides using vulgar language in her YouTube videos for pseudo social activism, Esparza seems to have forgotten her own humble upbringings.  It's ironic that the very people who live on and around CALLE DIECISEIS cannot afford to eat in her restaurant.  The Mexican immigrants and their sons and daughters who do the cooking, the cleaning, the landscaping and all that for Phoenix are not welcome at the Barrio Cafe.  I know that this is not a taco truck, but there is some overwhelming irony here that you locate your restaurant in a working class area and supposedly have sympathy for the plight of the downtrodden and the neighbors can't even eat  at your restaurant.  I guess that's capitalism.  Like that new car, by the way.
other I'm a sucker for a yummy coconut cupcake and Tammie Coe has the best around as far as I've tasted, and I've eaten a lot of bad coconut cupcakes -- all in the name of research of course.  Keep 'em coming, Tammie!
3 For such a small space, Stinkweeds definitely does a good job of packing as much variety as they can in their store. As far as record stores go, they've got a pretty decent collection in both CD's and vinyl. My only qualm with this place is that they tend to only carry newer stuff or the more popular titles of indie genres. If you're like me and like to peruse through older and hard-to-find collections, be sure to check out Tracks in Wax a few blocks down the street on Central. That being said, this is definitely a place you'll want to drop into. Their selection of concert/music video DVD's is pretty solid as is what their magazine stand has to offer. Sure, it's no Amoeba but it's the next best thing.
other Another other star review. I saw Beauty and the Beast with my little niece last night and she couldn't stop talking about it. (It was her reward for having good grades) I know I'm supposed to be the reviewing the theater, but I can't bring myself to rate them lower than 5. It was such a good show that even though there were a few minor issues at the theater,  they still deserve other stars. The auditorium is starting to show its age and hopefully they get the funding to make improvements. (Also some lady with a big head sat in front of us and my little niece couldn't see, so I changed seats with her.)  No big deal. Other than that the staff were very professional and helpful as always. Thank you again to yelp, Lindsey and to Gammage for giving us complimentary tickets. My little niece and I appreciates it and we enjoyed the show. :)
other If you are looking for a great location for bulk specialty flours and grains, beans, Freeze Dried fruits, vegetables, meats and dairy...they have a wonderful selection. They also have water storage and emergency supplies like solar ovens. I'm a big fan!
other One of my favorite boutiques in Scottsdale, I can always find something I don't need but have to have at Elan.  Lisa and her entire staff are friendly, helpful, and always have great suggestions.  They keep the inventory fresh and edgy.  Some of the pieces I've gotten there never fail to get compliments.  It can be a little pricy, but everything I've gotten there is well-made and things I'll wear again and again so... Lisa puts on some great events and really engages with her customers.
other Five Guys is good eats.  We've been eating at this location frequently (perhaps too frequently!) since it opened.Honestly, I don't think the food here is any fresher than In & Out Burger, but I like the selection of toppings (can you say, "fresh jalapenos!") and the great selection of sodas.The peanuts are a nice touch to get you warmed up for the Main Event while you wait.I personally think it's a little over-the-top to decorate the place in nothing but rave reviews (WE GET IT ALREADY!!), but the cool music makes up for the lack of ambience.Since the Zagat announcement earlier this week, it's been mobbed.  Try to avoid peak hours, unless you want to wait for a table.Five Guys is definitely pricier than In & Out, but I think the selection of ingredients justifies the premium.3 tips:-Our family of other (other adults, other kids under 10) can make do with one order of fries, though the orders have gotten smaller than when they first opened.-Ditto for the burgers.  Don't let the moniker "Little Cheeseburger" fool you.  I got the regular burger...once.  But the "Little" one is perfectly sufficient for me, especially after I load up on toppings.-Can't decide between the regular fries and the tasty Cajun fries?  Ask for a 'half-half' order and "POOF!", you'll get it!Enjoy!UPDATE: Gotta drop 'em to other stars.  The last several visits, the fries have been soggy.  Once they were even opaque in the center --- not cooked!  Ask for them EXTRA CRISPY!!
other Zupas officially opens today! I was invited to their VIP catering event a few days ago and was able to get a sneak peek. The soups are very good; I tasted all of them! My favorites are the wild mushroom it is very creamy and has a great flavor. The shrimp and sausage gumbo is very hearty with just a little New Orleans kick! I recommend them both! If you enjoy tomato soup theirs is a tomato basil and it is yummy!. One thing I really liked is that you can taste the soup before you order it! Bonus they have 8 varieties of soup to choose from!I had the turkey pesto artichoke panini as well it was very good. You can get a 7.99 combo of any other items soup, salad, sandwich. By the way it's not 1/other sizes with that combo either! I got a full panini and full soup.The soda bar is nice to you can create your own drinks!The ingredients are fresh and the employee's are very friendly. They also cater which is a big plus!
other Went there for a quick bite before the theater.   Had the buffalo sloppy joes, and they were disgusting--dry buns, thin sliced pickle.  Then had the duck spring rolls--also bad.   Then in an effort to eat something we could tolerate, ordered the lettuce cups with shrimp, and they were just adquate.   Very disappointing!
other Music was loud as shit.  The food, Jesus Christ the food.  Lame ass chips and salsa.  No joke, like 8 chips were on the plate.  Salsa was probably one of the worst I've had, no flavor at all and warm.   Salads come out warm (I'm assuming this is why I've been puking).  Gross right, warm lettuce.  Waiter let's us know they can make daughter a little quesadilla (cheese only) which comes out so greasy.  Our taco plates come out 10 minutes later.  other dinky tacos on each plate that are flavorless and luke warm at best.  Yes, they are spicey, no that does not mean they are flavorful.  I'm literally using my cell phone to see what was on the plate it's so dark.  Mint water was warm.  Gross and not refreshing whatsoever.  My daughter's quesadilla was $13, yes for other tortillas smaller than my hand and some 'cheese'.  I get it- make a dollar, but damn, don't rip your customers off.  So over the top lame.  Neither my husband nor myself finished.   Meal was $46.  Horrible.  Health department should go temp that place- I'm not sure the refrigeration is working properly.  Such a disappointment, I've been a vegetarian for 18 years- was looking forward to a new spot.  Won't be returning.  Ever.
other Although a huge fan of bloody food. I have to say, Green is really damn good. As a former cook at Spiral Diner, I always checked out veg joints in other states, and rarely liked any of it. Green is great. even the faux meat dishes, which are usually the least impressive. Keep up the good work.
other I've been to both locations, and I wonder if is fair to rate them together or should I do it separate? The Phoenix location is way to small for me, I don't like feeling like I'm almost sitting on my fellow diners lap and, this is a huge pet peeve of mine, I HATE smelling like food! Which is inevitable because the place is tiny. On the other hand it does have charm to it and the food is delicious.The Scottsdale location I can move, don't smell like food when I get out but is more sterile. And then there's the food....I always ordered fried chicken (of course!) and the breast tends to be dry so I decided to do thigh and drumstick. Well, this last time  the dark meat was fried to a burn:(  And not only the skin but the meat too. I should have asked for two different pieces but I was starving, and my hunger won. A shame because I left without satisfying my craving for good fried chicken. The waffle was delicious as always and I ordered smothered potatoes which were very good. It seems with their mac & cheese  people either love it or don't. I'm on the 'don't' group. It tastes milky and not very cheesy to me. I may try it again, because I love mac & cheese and I have the hope that maybe it was just bad luck before?Service is ok, sometimes better than others.After careful consideration, I'll give it other stars. I'll visit again, I'm pretty sure, and then I may go up or down one star.
other Just the basics.  Nothing fancy here but you can get a pedicure with hot stone massage for $18!
other I have lived here for about other months, the place is okay i guess, the ground are clean which I like, but the staff seems kinda disorganized.. they got our move in dates wrong which thank god I'm an early mover and didn't wait to the last min, then when we FINALLY moved in, we got a different apt than we were showed originally. The linen closet has a big freakin heater tank in it. Which okay whatever i guess is not that big of a deal but then I found out we pay more for our water because its not divided out between everyone else. Also EVERYTHING breaks our shower has broken twice, the closet light broke out the wall, the bathroom light fell out of the wall, the kitchen stove and the washer has all broke from the time we moved in (Last May). the only reason i give it other stars is because i do know there are a lot worse apartments out there but still my house is falling apart! When I go in the office i feel they always try and rush me out because i can finish my questions its really annoying. So be careful when looking at these apartments when looking for a place to live.
other Stinkweeds shaped my formative years.  Really.I started shopping at the (now gone) Tempe location when I was 15.  I had a few older friends into independent music who introduced me to this record store.  I begged my parents for rides and, when that wasn't happening, hopped on the bus for the hour-long trek.  Totally worth it.  100%.  I can't tell you how many awesome bands I began listening to just because I would browse the selection endlessly for something that looked interesting.  If I needed something specifically, Stinkweeds would order it for me if they didn't already have it in stock.  The staff was always welcoming and helpful, sometimes offering their own suggestions.But it's just a record store, right?  Wrong.  Stinkweeds is the jewel of Phoenix, as far as I am concerned.  Now that it's out in central Phoenix, I make it in far less.  Total bummer!
other An amazing section of light bulbs for just about anything you need. Most are in stock, reasonably priced and ready to take home. I have brought in several odd bulbs that I needed to have replaced with no markings on them - They always come through like champs. Take my advice and covert your old bulbs to LED - Well worth the cost for me just to not have to replace burnt out bulbs all the time - some of my lighting is very hard to get to and Halogens are so damn hot!
3 Dave's has a good BBQ sauce and reminds me very much of KC style BBQ and side's.  I have eaten here a few times and found that the portion sizes are immense!  Service has always been efficient and no reason to complain about anything.  I think this BBQ place would be the best option for a large group.Is this the best BBQ in the world?  No, but I sure wouldn't turn it down!Enjoy!
other BEST PANCAKES!!! We want the recipe. They're newly remodeled and better than ever. Always great bagels but now they have added more menu items, more choices. Great food, great people!
other This is going to be brutal.  Hide the children.If you've been to Chipotle, you'll feel right at home at Qdoba. That is, until you start eating. Complete and utter ripoff of the concept, except for the part that matters - the execution.  Where Chipotle succeeds, Qdoba fails miserably.  The ingredients are orders of magnitude shittier.  The burritos are just plain bad..  My burrito was loaded with rice and beans and very little meat - basically the opposite of what you'll get at the "other" place.  On top of that, the rice and beans were the suck.  And if you know Brak, you know that he LOVES his beans.  But not these.  About all they're good for is a massive bean fart shortly after ingesting this crap.If you want to know the root cause of this debacle, check out who the parent company is - it's Jack In The Crack®.  Pretty much explains it all.Avoid at all costs.  Receives Brak's dreaded zero-star review, rounded up to other because Yelp doesn't allow a zero.
3 I do love Chinese food, and for such a big city I find that Phoenix (or at least Scottsdale) lacks in options, either because they aren't the most welcoming of places, or simply because there aren't that many (compared to sushi restaurants for example. I've been to this location maybe 3 times since moving to Phoenix (8 years ago) and must say that I usually go because a friend as a "Pei Wei" craving. I found the food to be ok, but I'm typically one who doesn't like spicy food as I find it takes away instead of enhances the flavor. I wasn't too hungry and decided to take the chicken fried rice. I have to say that my favorite chicken fried rice is the one from Tottie's in Scottsdale that not only is delicious but always gives me left overs for lunch the next day. Portion was ok though the fried rice was a little sweet and the person I was dining with had the chicken lettuce wrap which wasn't too bad either. Service was disappointing as our food took about 10 minutes to come, but I must say the staff was helpful when I was asked where to get takeaway boxes as well as a takeaway cup. I'd give it other stars if after a handful of experiences I had Pei-Wei on my "must have" list but with Pita Jungle, Sack's , Subway, Rubio's, etc. nearby, the competition for "fast casual" is stiff and Pei Wei just doesn't cut it for me unless I really had a craving for Asian food that day.
other Really cool, foodie restaurant in scottsdale. All the food was fresh and original. The service was quick and pleasant, and definitely a place to consider to eat. It's not the cheapest restaurant but worth the price. This place definitely belongs in Scottsdale as is more upscale and you could sense it from the decor and service.
other Roka Akor Scottsdale is an extension of the celebrated Roka in London.I attended the opening night and a follow up for lunch the following day. Overall, I was impressed with the offerings of fresh sushi, and robata grilled tidbits. The dish that really won me over was crab hot pot and the creamy rice was absolutely zoftik.I drank many fresh sochu  infused cocktails, and crushed three bottles of sake with skilled Kikisake-shi, Sayaka Watanabe. This Japanese sake sommelier is London-based and the zuma-roka group sake trainer. They do have a fantastic sake selection. Easily the best in Scottsdale. She loved my sake brand I created with Midorikawa called Green River, and my low alcohol brand sake, Koide, as well.They also have a great Italian Sommelier named Alessandro Marchesan, who is also based out of London. Too bad they are only loaner personnel from HQ in London.The room is clean and beautiful with post modern Asian inspired lines. The staff is eager and young, but quite unskilled in refined service.  I am sure that will be a long cycle for the Roka management to fix. I have a dear friend who dined there on her birthday. She told me the service was "shockingly bad." She then reiterated that is was,  "so bad that it was entertainingly bad!" The food great and hopefully the service will match soon. Kanpai, Roka..kudos on your sake program.
other Well, I cannot believe I have waited this long to give an update on Morgan!!  Especially since she is FANTASTIC!!  Yes, I have been back to her for the 5th time now and I love what she suggested I do to the color on my hair (much better than what I was doing) and her haircuts are the best.  She also has done some other treatments on my hair that have made it hold up under this hard, dry AZ weather.  And, she is so sweet and caring.  Oh, she has also gone out of her way to make an introduction to another of her clients (also from the South) who was new here and had not met many people and we really hit it off.  Morgan knew we would.  I mean what more can you ask for.........go for it...YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY.   This from a HAPPY, HAPPY Client, Christine
other This place hits everything on my "it's Awesome" list. First off it's a family run little place.Second it's in a hole in the wall area.Thirdly and most importantly it is all made in house. Fourtherly it is awesomeWe were in Gilbert staying at a friend's house for spring training, GO DODGERS!!! We hit the usuals, Waffle House, Dunkin Donuts, Dodger Dogs at the game, and our friends asked do you like sandwiches?If there is one food group that I love, it has to be the Sandwich group, and this place is one of my top other sandwiches stops of all time.We ate in the Lounge(y)(ie) area, which has a more adult vibe going on. We first started with their fresh bread, and tomato basalmic vinegar salsa(y) thing. Which was great, we had two rounds of that while we drank our beverages, and waited on our sandwiches.I ordered the Cuban sandwich with the potato salad, and the wife ordered the Chicken breast sandwich, with pasta salad. My sandwich came out perfectly, from the fresh Ciabatta Bread to the outstanding roasted pork. I would order this pork just by itself; it was juicy, and full of flavor, just like my Cuban grandmother makes. While this sandwich is a true Cuban sandwich, not using swiss, and not being pressed, it is not advertised as an actual Cuban, just a Cuban style, like me.Now this potato salad was some of the best I have ever had, and not just because it had bacon, which is awesome, but the use of yukon gold potatoes, instead of red, or russets has been a revelation to me. This is how I am going to prepare all off my potato salads from now on.After all that I still ordered the carrot cake, which like everything else is made in house with local ingredients, it was warm with a not overly sweet cream cheese frosting. The wife got the lava cake with some beer ice cream. Even though I ate most of my carrot cake, and loved it, I wish I had a full gallon of that beer ice cream, it was just perfect. In fact I am planning another trip out that way, just for that ice cream.
other After reading many decent reviews and seeing how close the restaurant was to home, I decided to give it a try.The young lady at the counter was impatient and had no interpersonal skills. The food was just not good; this place is 'Chinese take-out' at best.
3 Earl's is Earl's - not great - not bad. If you're in the neighborhood and don't have anywhere else to go, go to Earl's. By far there are better choices, but Earl's will do when you're in a pinch.Typical bar food with no particular edge to make it memorable. The staff is very friendly and the service is very good. Just average, not memorable.
3 The venue, which is close to campus, usually gets all the big shows from Hot Hot Heat to Incubus to Mickey Avalon to Brand New. The great thing about the venue is that you can stand almost anywhere and still be able to see the band. There's a big bar inside with friendly bartenders, although the well drinks can be a little pricey. There's usually a hot dog vendor outside and most of the bands performing can be found walking around before and/or after their sets, making it easy to mingle. The downside about the Marquee is that parking sucks. There's not a ton of parking in the club's lot and the nearby lots usually fill up fast so be prepared to trek down Mill to get to and from your car if you don't arrive early.
other *cut to scene* Friday night, lounging around discussing the lameness of the evening, ready to indulge in a new adventure. six pack of Newcastle sits untouched in fridge and bellys aching for fulfillment. yelp.com search reveals a local japanese eatery nearby. enter, Hana.first off, pre-game excitement for this BYOB, local, fresh sushi spot. Newcastle in hand, my friend and I strutted in here at around 8pm on a mildly warm Friday night. the place is jammed, and a couple parties stand around waiting for tables. great, a long wait. nope, two seats open at the bar. sat down, and our beer was immediately taken and put in a fridge to ensure it wouldn't lose any of it's remarkably smooth quality.  first beer is poured, and the excitement ensues. friendly and welcoming server devluges us in the specials, and unfortunately they were out of most of their fish as they have been for three weeks. toro and salmon were our options, so we went with a special for the night, the spider roll, and the vegas roll. also, edamame to start.the food was superb. the edamame came spicy with a side of chili flakes and siracha for our never ending quest to burn the shit out of our mouths. a second round of newcastle was brought upon when our first was finished, and the sushi came shortly thereafter, looking like little pieces of art. both sets of rolls were enormous and came about 6 to a plate. the vegas roll was packed with cream cheese, avocado, and salmon. the special roll, the spider roll, was full of crispy soft shell crab and just enough spicy-ness for a much needed kick in the mouth. one dip in my wasabi/soy sauce concoction was more than enough.our third and final beer was poured by an overly-anxious and over-stimulated, presumably newbie, bus boy. I had about other inches of head on my beer and my friend got hers spilled and nearly twice as much head.  he excellent waitress we had made up for this guys slips during the meal. the staff wished us a nice farewell on our way out, and I felt as though I had just left a very close friend's house. I will definitely be back with more six packs and good friends to share this little diamond in the rough with.
3 On a recent visit to Arizona, my mother and I ventured into this store. Neither of us had stepped foot in it before, even though she lives a mile away. The aisles are broken out by cuisine, and the selection was awesome.  I was particularly surprised by the Holland, Dutch, Brazilian, and British aisle, in market classified as Asian. Very unexpected. I bet they would be more business if they boasted to be more international. I really liked this place, but the word needs to get out about Lee Lee's.  If more people shop, they will restock their shelves more often, and most items won't be so close to their expiration date. Final points:- check expiration dates before purchasing- Generally clean but the shelved items needed to be dusted and straightened, especially the aisle with dishes. They were all over the place and had to hunt for matching bowls.  It's a market, not a dollar store- If you can get past the initial fish smell, you won't be disappointed.
other Yeah it kind of sux! Burgers aint that great (Though not terrible), girls aint that hot (At all :( ), place aint very exciting (or clean).Yeah it is kind of cool that they are dressed as nurses and you get a little hospital bracelet with their name and such. However, putting on mandatory hospital gown is odd and kind of off putting (To me anyhow). They also do have a bar and sell unfiltered stogies of some kind. They also do not take CC!!! WTF I say! Is is a bit too much "Old times charm" for my taste. There is an ATM right in there so there is no real need to bring cash with you. I do not know, whole thing kind of odd. It would fit my better in like Greer or Page or something, rather then in Chandler.
other If I could give zero stars, I would.  I have never spent more time looking for a bar than I have looking for this. And not like a cool underground dance club in L.A.  When we finally found this sh*thole sandwiched between two vacant businesses, it was barely visible.  The sign for it looked like it was written with a sharpie on a piece of cardboard and someone duct tapped a flashlight to it.  Before we even entered the bar, as my friend and I were walking up two redneck bikers whispered, "Fags" as we walked by them.  I don't think these were the kind of guys you argued with so I let it go.  When we entered the bar I noticed several "No firearms" signs plastered on the walls.  I'm assuming they've had a problem with this before.  Remember that scene in the Blues Brothers where they go to the country bar and get the look of death from the patrons?  That's how I felt.  The decor of this bar was interesting.  It looked as if they got the tables and chairs from an old 70s Vegas casino.  The place is about the size of a small apartment's living room so getting a seat is pretty much impossible.  We went to the bar to do some karaoke, but apparently they also sell crappy jewelry for some reason?  Weird.  I've also never heard so much cussing from karaoke singers.  One of the drunken hicks actually got into a shouting match with one of the morbidly obese toothless tattooed bicker chicks where they argued who was the bitch and who was the pussy.  Halfway through my beer, my friends showed up and they refused to go inside so I ran away and never looked back.  TIP: If you go here wear a black leather jacket, bandana and Harley Davidson gear.
other Very clean and well thought out floor plans, nice to have a friendly staff with smiling faces. Best Target I have been to in a while.
other I always have good time at this place.  I could write a page about Geisha, but the previous reviews pretty much sum this place up.      *   Self servicing bathrooms (Ladies only)     *   Fantastic Happy Hour pricing- The veggie pot stickers are the bomb!    *   Hot waitresses ... barely of age to serve you alcohol =)    *   Private karaoke rooms that allow you to humiliate yourself in front of your friends onlyThe only thing I would steer clear of is the specialty drinks they are overly sweet and are not made with fresh fruit... even when they say they are. The waitress cleared that up for me last weekend =).
other So far the only thing I have eaten at Verde that was not awesome was breakfast. Don't get me wrong it was yummy, but lunch or dinner is much better here. My favorite dish is the tacos al fresco. Two fresh tortillas loaded with fresh colorful veggies and coated in a delicious vinaigrette. Did I mention everything is super fresh? The rice and beans are also very good. The salsas and guacamole are also awesome. One is smoky while the other has great tang and spice. Nothing, however, outshines their delicious tortillas. I love walking by and seeing someone preparing them in the window. The decor and atmosphere are also great. The owners are super nice too. I really can't complain about this awesome place!
other My son and his family arrived into Scottsdale Tuesday April 10 on there way to California. We decided to eat at RnR before they continued there trip.  My son and my wife ordered a hamburger and fries. The fries had no taste and my son asked for two new orders. My grandchildren ate the original fries, while the new fries loaded with Parmesan cheese. The fries were not hot, nor had the cheese melted. I had a few of the fries and did not have as severe a case of food poisoning as my son and my wife. I have recommended RnR in the past. I do not think I will in the future.
other The wood saw is always out of service...The garden department is nice, but the staff is a little strange.This location never seems to be busy, so check out times are short. The prices are higher than "another" home improvement store just east on Baseline.Meh.
other These guys are still delivering consistenly good, fresh food.  It's a great little neighborhood place, good food, friendly owners.  Just a really good place to go for a nice meal out - nothing fancy.  Clean restrooms - always.Good limoncello after dinner - always a hit!
3 Not the best burger I've ever had, but a fun place to try with the coworkers on a Friday afternoon. I had the quadruple bypass and a few helpings from the all-you-can-eat fry station. Better than BK/McD's, but nothing to write home about. The waitresses were hot and they happily wheeled me out to my car in a wheelchair! But it's more of an attraction than anything else.
other I just went here for lunch.  I really have nothing to add to the other reviews on here because they pretty much all sum it up.  It gets crowded, the ordering process is a clusterfuk, they place looks sketchy and dirty, the staff is very friendly and helpful, yada yada.  The place isn't worth all the hype but definitely is worth a visit if you are in the mood for something unique.  Its not the healthiest or highest quality cuisine, but it is a pretty solid place and worth a shot.* Jerk Chicken = very good* Pollo Diablo = spicy and awesome and my stomach is going to hate me later* Jade Red Chicken = excellent* Pork Fried Rice = very good* Red Salsa Stuff = excellent* Refried Beans = standard* Snickerdoodle Cookie = awesome
other If you got a craving for pizza and don't want to feel too guilty about eating it, this always seems to satiate that fix. The pizzas here are ultra thin and there are many varieties available. Bryan and I always get other pizzas because we would still be hungry if we just order one without an appetizer and we can always take the extra home. Today we ate the pepperoni and mushroom pizza and the potato and feta cheese pizza with olive tempanade. Both were yummy in their own way! We ate the tomato, mozzarella, and pesto bruschetta as an appetizer which came out unbelievably quick while waiting for our pizzas. Sauce's pizzas are unique in their own right that I crave when I want something lighter than regular hand tossed pizzas yet don't want to spend as much for gourmet pizzas. It's a comfortable yet yummy in-between compromise!
other Recently I had the pleasure of eating at this great new Iron Chef Jose Garces restaurant. Pulling up to the front entrance to the restaurant my girlfriend and I were greeted by extremely nice doorman who valet our vehicle for us. We were a bit concerned that we were going to get wet from the rain on this day, but thanks to the valet service the hotel & restaurant provide we stayed warm and dry! Now I must say we were taken back from the decor inside the restaurant... It was spectacular!! The way the restaurant is decorated just puts a smile on your face! Also, it gives you a feel for Iron Chef Jose Garces personality which seems to be light and fun. The food is absolutely amazing!! We split the "IGNACIO" Nachos which have black beans, tomato, queso mixto, jalapeño, chile de arbol, and radish, and the Barbbacoa "Costillas" berkshire pork spare ribs, chipotle-cider mustard bbq they were tender, juicy, and delicious! We tried the House Margarita the "Distrito" and the white "Mexican Sangria" both were spectacular!! I have never heard of a white sangria before.. But WOW it was amazing! All of the employees we encountered were extremely nice, knowledgeable, and sincere. This restaurant will definitely stay on my regular to do list! Thanks to everyone who gave us a wonderful experience!!!
other Still flying solo.  My friends took me for dinner here and it was excellent.  Humus appetizer was great.  For main course did broiled chicken pita wrap and it was perfect.  Recommend!
other This is my dad and I favorite lunch spot. Pho-real! Impeccable service and the freshest food. Their spring rolls ate immaculate, fried rice is pretty close to Peruvian friend rice, and their pho is truly unphoghetable. The servers are friendly, the owner always asks you how the food was. Nestled inside the Mekong plaza market this place will meet all your expectations in delicious Vietnamese cuisine.
other I will give this place a 5th star even though i wait for 30+ mins every time i go. that can only mean it's good right? Well, it's that friendly AND that good that i dont mind waiting. i hope it doesnt lose that customer service aspect that makes it so approachable. best sausage gravy in town with a nice spice to it. i'm not fond of their potato has thingys... but their bfast nachos are fab and their white out omelette is also very tasty. my favorite item - turkey sausage eggs benedict... DD style (trade sausage gravy for hollandaise) - very filling as you can imagine. breakfast club will still be the old town brunch location for when visitors come visit me but for week in and week out sunday morning brunch, this is my spot.
other I am in love.  This restaurant does everything a good restaurant should.  Ambiance, service and product were good.  The only disappointment I had was with the hour wait on the Monday we went without a reservation.My party of four had an excellent time celebrating a birthday.  Two had the short ribs.  Tender to a fault, served with delicious Bar-B-Que sauce and pecan grits.  One had the fillet with a spicy aioli and delicious potatoes.My meal was a huge pork chop, stuffed with Maytag bleu on a ancho bread pudding.  For an app I split the chop salad.  It deserves special mention and I do recommend it, but it is not a sustaining salad, more of a amuse-bouche.  For dessert we split the peanut-butter cheese cake, delicious.The beverages deserve some mention.  The wine list is this restaurants' only fault, it is tooooo long.  There is a smaller, delicious by-the-glass selection.  The beer selection is well crafted.  I had two of my favorite beers, Dogfishhead Chicory Stout, something I had only had by bottle, wonderful.I normally don't like high-priced eateries b/c there is often a lack of creativity, Cowboy Ciao doesn't disappoint.  Recommended over any Capital Griller or Flemmingsery for creativity and value for dollar.
other its HOTin the valley in the summer time and QT lives up to its name- ONE STOP DRINK SHOP! HEAVEN in the summer time and the price is unbeatable!
other I just had my first Tammie Coe cake last week for my birthday, and I will NEVER be the same again.  I don't normally eat cake, in fact, if it's not Brownies, I don't eat it.  But this cake drew me in with it's appealing fondant.  From there, I got lost in the spongy richness of the cake.  A cornicopia of flaverful goodness.So make a metal note to yourself, I will only eat Brownies and Tamie Coe cakes.Oh, and special thanks to Arts G (previous review) for telling me what the hell fondant is.  I was just calling it "sheet like frosting".
3 A hand-job with gardening gloves.....I went looking for Scottsdale Auto Salon to get a hand wash tint quote on my new Mini today. Finding it out of business, I whipped out my handy-dandy Yelp iPhone app looking for a nearby alternate to at least get the wash done and found Classic Car Spa. Expecting to pay a bit more for a traditional hand wash I was surprised to find a machine assisted process. I'd spent way to long trying to locate the place (thank you Google maps) so I just opted for their supreme wash, which includes both interior and exterior detail.My son and I watched the car move through the process and saw that at least the 'wash part' was done by hand, but they used the same mitts from the filthy truck that had gone through previously. -other starAfter seeing this, I should have watched their 'interior detail' more closely. When I got the car back there were lines of dirt in my white roof, and water spots on the accent chrome. When we got in the car there still bits of chip on the seat and floor mat from my sons spill the day, and it was obvious that the dash and interior hadn't been detailed. (Unless they refrain from using any product what so ever on the interior of the car. The dash and steering wheel were bone dry and dusty.)  - other starI should have brought it up to someone, but my husbands' and sons' hunger won over and we just left. Thankfully all of their other locations are to far out of the way to bother detouring to again.The staff was friendly, and their waiting area was pleasant with lots of drink choices, although I'm not sure their waiting area was comfy enough for anything longer than a wash.
other I was looking into gyms around the area. Upon entering I was greeted by the front desk guy. I asked about memberships and then he said, "Sorry we are sold out". I stood there stunned. Then he snickered, "Just kidding". Trying to be a good sport I went with it. Next came the young sales guy. He was personable - at first anyways. Showed me around the gym and I was interested in joining. Next we went over to the childcare area since I have a little one. Children were in the room however the two girls monitoring the room were chatting it up with one another and ignoring the kids. Bad sign. I asked the girls if they were CPR certified and had fingerprinting and background checks. The world stopped for just a moment and they stared at me. I had interrupted their important conversation. Then they were both saying, "Yeah, like, well, um, no, I mean yes,". In other words, no straight answers. We sat at the sales guy's desk and the wheeling and dealing began. I felt like I was purchasing a new car. "If you choose option A, you then can go to all the gyms." "If you choose option B, then only here" . The whole time I could see the children's area and the kids were being completely ignored (and we are talking very little children). When I told the sales man I needed to think about it he switched into some type of Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde routine. "Well you only have today to make a decision, after that no price guarantee!!!"   From there he was down right rude.I walked out of there thinking what the heck just happened. Like Sarah G, I felt horrible when I left this gym.  It was an awful experience. Ended up getting a membership at Tangible Fitness on 7th Street. They don't have the same amenities however it is locally owned, and the people are very nice there.
other This was the first place my husband to me out to eat out when we started dating, OMG I loved it. The staff is always extremely nice prompt at this location, we enjoy their food and I epically am in love with the 99 cent margaritas they are the best. We always have a wonderful time here new and old memories.
other I crave breakfast food all the time, but I want something more than an Ihop or Dennys. Not only is Crackers & Co way better than a mainstream breakfast place, it's actually cheaper too!I ordered the breakfast burrito without meat and it was amazing. It had just the right amount of spice and the portions were way bigger than I imagined. Their country potatoes are awesome and have nice, brown, crunchy edges. I went with a group of other people who all ordered different breakfast items and not a single person was disappointed with their food.This place was not only really cute but also great for the price and taste. Plus, they serve breakfast all day on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.I can't wait to go back.
other What was Dunkin Donuts thinking when they took out the selection of donuts and now only offer a choice of 10.  It used to be you couldn't decide which one to get, now you just have to settle for what they have.  This new and improved Dunkin Donuts is the worst.  I will return for coffee when I get the urge...but never for a donut!!  Oh and another thing...my Dunkin Donuts used to have Baskin Robbins inside...that is gone too...again WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!
3 This is a fun place.  It is a great place for a fast, cheap meal.  Is it truly authentic?  It is probably closer to being authentic to many places around the country. Wagamama-like?  Perhaps.  If you know how to order you will do okay here.  A great addition to restaurants in Tempe!
other Best muffler shop in town. There are VERY few shops that I trust, and Mighty Muffler is one of them.  Greg has worked on multiple cars and has always done a great job.  If there is ever any issues he takes care of the problem, no questions asked.
other Dana, there is no other like Dana!  Even my kids ask to go visit her!   I have other children, other boys ages 3 1/other and other 1/other and other girls ages 8 and 19 months.  Dana has been cutting their hair for quite some time. They all have a style of their own and have always been happy every time we leave. She has a great shop in Downtown Scottsdale, convenient and is very accomodating.  Highly recommended by this Mom and her children!!
other I don't know if I should say I love this place or really dislike them.  They are dangerous.  It's like they know my number.  I was supposed to just passed by and head to another store, but I couldn't help it. I saw the shoe sale, they have it every few months now.  Tons of shoes for 65% off.  I guess a girl cannot have enough shoes.  Hey, my pretty shoes don't care if I gain or loose a few pounds.  Today, I got 3 more pairs. Danny helped me out, he has been in the shoe department forever.  I remember him helping me since 2006 at least, wow, that is 6 years now.I love some of the Gianni Binni Dresses, too (that is the house brand).  They are very well made and if you are lucky enough to catch them on one of the big sales you can score a great dress for under $80.00
other Delicious kosher food in Scottsdale?  Vegetarian? Awesome!We go to this restaurant regularly.  The food is always great.  The service, as many other yelpers have mentioned, can be excruciatingly slow some times.  I will say that in the last month or so, they have hired some more waiters and those boys are hustlin'.  It's an improvement, but I agree with others who have said this might not be a good choice if you are short on time.I like the Ginger Soy Beef, Veggie Hot Pot, Kung Pao Chicken and so on and so on.  The food is very good, but not super spicy how I like it.  I would recommend this spot for the great food and the improvements in service.
other WOWSA- we just moved here from NYC and this pizza is like home :)  We tried the Brooklyn and Da Works  pies and the Brooklyn was WAY BETTER. I didn't like the Da Works (don't care for fresh tomatoes on top of my pizza).  This will be our regular pizza joint for the area- we were both impressed and will order many more Brooklyn pizzas from NYPD! Having just moved from NYC we can speak with authority when we say "It's authentic NY pizza!"
other One of my favorite places to take my 3 and other year old. Only drawback is it gets really crowded- especially with the school groups so we call early to see how many school groups there are and then we decide if its worth it or not. They sometimes host 500 kids at this museum and thats just not fun. Other than that this place is amazing.
other What a great place. We (family of three) went on a Sunday afternoon. What a fun place, great food, friendly staff. The manager was there, she let my son sit on the michanical bull. fun. fun. fun
other I moved to phoenix from northern California where I would get my Dutch Bros. fix almost every day! Either I was spoiled by the great customer service in my area or the service here is really that horrible. I've gone a handful of times and they have all been extremely shallow and inattentive. Not to mention they've all charged me different prices for the same drink! One person charges me $3.50 and someone else charges me $5.25?? Get your act together and be a bit more friendly and real with your customers.
other Probably like many recent college graduates who enjoys the drink, one of my life goals it to eventually open up a microbrewery. I tend to shy away from the idea of a brewpub since I believe that an establishment should place focus on either its beer or the food. Places that do both tend to have mediocre beer and food or excellent beer but bad food. Four Peaks somehow passes the test on both their food and the beer.First off, parking sucks and the place gets busy. I went on a Wednesday evening and it was packed. But with Happy Hour, what do you expect? Three dollar pints allowed me to try a bunch of their beers. My favorites included Kilt Lifter, Hop Knot IPA and the Raj IPA. They even held a delicious cask ale, style of holding beer that (thankfully) seems to be making its way into breweries and bars. The food included fairly typical brewpub fare. Burgers, wings, sandwiches etc. All of our items were of fairly decent quality. Or perhaps I was a bit too drunk to really notice the awful nature of the food. But fuck it, that beer was good. Hands down the best brews I've had at a brewpub.
other Very cool neighborhood restaurant and wine bar in North Scottsdale.  The bartender was extremely friendly and helpful and the selection was great.  The pizzas looked fantastic, so we'll be coming back to try them out!
other Our team ordered a pizza while we were in a business meeting and the guys were great in delivering it on time. As a bonus the pizza was great. I'm usually a stickler when it comes to crust, and this stuff was great. The only thing I didn't like was that the margarita had tomatoes on it and not tomato sauce. Just a personal preference. Also wish they added the basil leaves at the end to keep it from fully cooking/charing.We'll be ordering from here again.
other The rap on Starbucks is that they "over-roast" or "incinerate" their beans.And I think that might be right...sometimes at Starbucks, it seems like I'm drinking something brewed from charcoal briquettes...it doesn't taste good:(Now, I will tell you that I am really no connoisseur of coffees...I like coffee, you know...a good dark roast, made with freshly roasted beans:)But the beans don't have to come from a specific plant , grown on the southern side of a special hill in Columbia and then eaten and pooped out by a badger of some sort.No, I just want a decent cup of coffee at a decent price:)Why can't Starbucks do that?I occasionally need to meet someone for business, and Starbucks comes up as meeting place (and I understand that...they are almost annoyingly ubiquitous:)I have sat at a cafe table on a street corner in San Francisco, having a cup of coffee at a Starbucks...looking at the Starbucks across the street...Lewis Black calls it "the place where space and time folds in on itself"...I say "why build the Hadron Super Collider to open a black hole?"...Starbucks did it a decade ago with a combination of charred coffee beans and vats of money to open a Starbucks for every adult in the United States:)In and of itself, that's no reason for a other star review...Gordon Gecko said it best..."Greed is Good!" and Starbucks exemplifies that credo...they are a generally very successful corporation grown up from the Bay area defectors from Peet's Coffee...I have no problem with success:)No, my gripe with Starbucks is that they seem to be all about the marketing and not about the product...their coffee is crap:) So is most of the stuff they serve...it's second or third rate, at best.And just because it's convenient doesn't mean we all need to stop in.There is better coffee and better tea and better everything around...at much better prices...it's worth looking for another meeting spot:)
other From the moment I walked into the lobby the staff displayed a level of professionalism that you don't get to see everyday. Each staff member that I came into contact with gave me a handshake and said, "Welcome to our business". I don't normally enjoy going to the dentist, but this has been the complete opposite. They made me feel very comfortable and confident that I was going to be happy with my experience, and I was!  So I set up an appointment for my 9 year old son on the way out. Since then we have both been in to have work done. My son need one filling and he took it very well, then trotted off to school like nothing ever happened. I started with a deep cleaning from Bobbie Lynn Tucker , RDH.  She was very nice and personable, did a wonderful job cleaning my teeth, not to mention gentle. I was never in any pain either during or after the procedure.  My following visit was with Dr. Brittian, DDS.  I needed a few fillings and I am very pleased with his work. Again gentle and quick.  My teeth look beautiful and feel wonderful. They were great with explaining all the costs and have cool perks like a Rewards Program.  I also liked the glass back wall that gives the patient a private calm view of the outdoors. The flat screens are cool too, but my only complaint is that when I asked quite seriously if they could change the channel, ( I dislike sport shows a lot) they were not going to budge. That might be something they want to work out. Other than that I really would recommend  them to everyone.
other If you are looking for a good vet, you have to read this.If you are looking for a vet that is COMPETENT, a vet that REALLY CARES about animals and a vet that is INEXPENSIVE and reasonably priced, then you really have to check out Dr. Howard at Grayhawk Animal Hospital in North Scottsdale. He is worth the trip.I am so impressed by Dr. Howard and his EXCEPTIONAL STAFF. Every time we come here we leave satisfied beyond our expectations. Since my last review, we have used them two more times. Once when Spencer got neutered, and once when he had to have his nails trimmed. I have to say I am so very impressed. I was holding back on reviewing them again until I could be certain that it would be an accurate review and to be certain that they are consistent with their outstanding service and pricing. Well, I can say confidently now that they most certainly are.Spencer was neutered here some time ago with no complications and no outrageous fees. When he was done his procedure, I received a happy, completely alert dog back from them. His incision was minimal, the sutures were tight and he healed quickly. It was done so well that he did not even lick at the area. It was like nothing ever happened.More recently, Spencer needed his nails trimmed, and because he was a rescued dog from a very abusive situation, he does not trust people and has a phobia to anyone touching his tail or feet. It is so bad that when I try to nicely, calmly approach him to trim his nails, he urinates all over himself and hides for the rest of the day. Spencer was really abused and as a result, grooming is really difficult.Well, I discussed this with the doctor's office and we decided that sedation (unfortunately) was our only option. His nails were getting too long and painful and something needed to be done. Well, we just got him back from the office and they were so good about it that they did not even have to sedate him. I am impressed, but what I am more impressed with is that they first tried to trim his nails without using sedation and had his best interest in mind. They really care about the animals they treat. They could have sedated him. It would have been quicker and easier and more profitable for them, but they didn't. They really did not want to use a drug on him if they did not have to - and so they didn't. They trimmed his nails up well and did not even cut into the quick or make him bleed. He left there, again and as usual, a happy, well taken care of dog. And we left there ecstatic! The bill was so inexpensive and Spencer was taken care of so well - like he was their dog. I just can't say enough good things about this Veterinary Office. I think that everyone knows that good medical professionals are hard to find - for humans and/or animals. So often, they just don't care about the patient. Well, not here. It appears to be their top priority. Dr. Howard is a very happy, well educated man and it shows in his practice in every way - right down to all of the people he hires (they are all equally happy and competent!). You will not be disappointed if you go here. They are honest and kind and not out to rip you off or get as much money from you as they can. They are truly exceptional. So if you need honest, competent & friendly care at very affordable prices, you owe it to yourself and your pet to make the trip over to see Dr. Howard at Grayhawk animal hospital. You will be in good hands! You will save money, and you won't be disappointed in the least.They are truly exceptional, but that is the end result of really caring, really liking your profession and really knowing what you are doing... And we love them for it!
other I have been exploring more of the park recently.  I want to add that the National Trail (which is almost 1other miles long and goes from one end to the other) is a real gem.  The views on this trail are outstanding, and on the western half, you will find far fewer people than on the eastern half.  Highly recommended.
3 Spa whore, I am! I work in the industry, live in the industry and have breathed the industry for the last other years so I know spas. After a few stressful weeks of work, school and planning a wedding I suddenly remembered I am a better version of myself when I take adult time outs. My "corner", so to speak, was at Joya spa. I just so happen to remember a TravelZoo purchase I made a few months ago for a massage or facial at Joya Spa at the Montelucia Resort in Phoenix.Boy, was I excited! I called, booked an appointment with a male therapist and started to prepare myself for my next great spa adventure. After anxiously awaiting  Sunday to roll around, I finally found myself walking into a Moroccan paradise. The space was entrancing from the moment I walked in. It smelled like a spa and helped to set the mood for my day of relaxation. I was given a full tour of the facilities and allowed to set my intentions with small crystals in a round room, and then brought into a room with a GIANT crystal used to help calm, bring intention and awareness of your visit and to yourself. The woman giving me the tour was very professional and thorough. Though informative, I was waiting for a warm connection from her, and never received it.After being led to the locker room, I changed into my bathing suit and waited in the woman's lounge for my provider to find me and take me back for my massage experience.I chose a male provider. Knowing I had tension, knots and stress I was hoping for a firm, slow, relaxing massage. I have had MANY massages and this one was actually a little disappointing. My therapist picked me 7 minutes late and ended other minutes early. The strokes consisted of a lot of rocking and fast movements. Not really the relaxing experience I was craving. My massage therapist was very sweet and genuine in his approach, I was just hoping for something more.I definitely didn't let my treatment ruin my experience! The facilities were amazing!  They were clean and always stocked with towels. I have to say the spa attendants ROCKED!!!!! I could not believe how efficient they were. I observed on other occasions (YES 5) every time a shower was vacant an attendant was there to clean it up, any time a towel was on the floor, it got picked up immediately. They worked together like a well oiled machine! And I would love to give them props for making me take notice to the work the do!I plan on returning! I may not receive a massage because of my experience, but I truly enjoyed the facilities and the staff. I'm even thinking of booking a suite for my bridal party to enjoy the day there. In the end, if you know massage the way I do, please beware, you may not get all the bang for your buck in your treatment.
other I love this store!  very underwhelming, which i love being able to get in/ get out... their produce prices, and chili prices are amazing!  The staff is funny and awesome.  the music makes me dance in the isles LOL.  literally.  they also give you free marinade with any meat purchase which is way cool.I don't like their prices on bread, cake mixes, and things like that, but their produce more than makes up for that, prices are awesome, and its absolutely fabulous and fresh.Ronney
other This place is right up my alley.Smithwick's on tap- checkAwesome fish & chips (award-winning for a good reason)- checkGood pub vibe accompanied by live music- checkA nice soccer following (the unofficial bar for Glasgow Celtic supporters- not my club, but good enough)- checkI'll go with other & 1/other stars.
other Great soup at a great price.I go for the veggie soup normally, since I'm a bit leery of the raw meats and strange meatballs you can get.  Their vermicelli is also quite edible.Service could be a little quicker.Bring cash if you're spending less than $other - with pho and water you will pay 3.50 + tax.  Cheapest lunch in town.
other I'm not sure how I've missed trying this place, after over a decade of living in the Valley, partly as an ASU student in need of a good hang-over recovery joint. I can't believe I relied exclusively on the IHOP on Apache Blvd, all those years in Tempe. Dammit!It was packed on the New Year's Day morning I came here with a friend. The service was a bit slow but on par with my expectations for a jam-packed popular breakfast joint on New Year's Day. I ordered a calorie-laden Cajun skillet with scrambled eggs. I'm knocking off a star because the chicken pieces were too dry for my taste. But the rest of the skillet was very good. The service was friendly and professional. Wildcats beware, lots of ASU students within.
other I had the pleasure of living across the street from this treasure for about 6 years. I'm still lucky enough to work close by.   Let me be clear. I 'm reviewing Haji Baba as a GROCERY STORE first.  Then I will give you some insight into the prepared food for take-out or in-store dining.This is one of the few stores in Arizona where you have several choices for pita bread--it's also the ONLY place I've found for whole wheat pita.There are several choices for Feta cheese. Danish, French,Greek...same with olives--there are choices.I ALWAYS buy my tahini here. All the prices are very inexpensive.Need spices???  They have them all.  At about 25% of the price you would pay anywhere else.The best way to describe Haji Baba is that it is a REAL grocery store, with REAL prices, for REAL people.  It is NOT a "specialty store" with trendy items and inflated prices.  They sell food items that you will actually use.  The bonus here?  You won't find a 10 year old can or jar of something.On to the "restaurant" portion.  Haji Baba is better if you think of it as a take-out joint that happens to have places to sit and eat.  They do have tables and they do perform table service, it's just got zero charm.  You go for the food, that's it.Okay, food.  The lamb tongue sandwich is to die for.  Let me repeat.  The LAMB TONGUE PITA SANDWICH.  GET IT!  Their baba ganouj is also darned tootin' tasty.  Actually, I sometimes dream about their baba ganouj.I'm not crazy about their hummus, maybe because making hummus takes other minutes and mine is bomb? But it's not bad.Gyros are good and not greasy. Greasy gyro meat is a pet peeve of mine.Chicken shwarma?  Yup, that's good too.I'm sure I've had something  to eat  here that I was a little disappointed in, but I honestly can't remember what, or when.
other Their amazing prices are instantly countered by despairing customer service.  If I want low prices I will go to goodwill over this place.  Looks like Dillard's is on my list of do not shop.
3 Took my daughter to Mendy's Place other times. Treatments, doctors, nurses and other staff were great.My complaint is that the ER physicians are not in-network (participating) with most insurance companies. Even though the hospital is participating, the physicians are not , thus resulting in larger physician bills.Us consumers pay dearly for our health insurance. I don't like being overcharged by greedy physicians.
other "MMMM. THIS IS. A TASTY BURGER." - Jules. Pulp Fiction.I like this place, my siblings like this place, and it's the best thing I've got to remembering better times back home in California. It's a quick fix for people who want good burgers at a decent price. It always hits the spot when I'm feeling like a fatty. :)Even considered biking all the way here from my house when my car was dead and going through the drive through. (Coz the cool kids did it back then... In CA anyway haha. And employees didn't care.)I agree that drive thru is an atrociously long wait during the afternoon (after school). Peeps who work here seem pretty chill since I always ALWAYS, ask them for the hats and throw dozens and dozens of ketchup packets in with my to-go orders. Biiiiiiiiiiig plus!
other Bad food, but lots of it.  If you have a hangover and need grease, this is your place.  Other than that, drive a block and eat at Mucho Gusto down the street--now that is real mexican food!
other Kind of cold, otherwise your typical Paradise Bakery. Delicious chicken Caesar salads.
other Fabulous! Great views (obviously) of the city. Very romantic. Amazing wine list. Superb service. Delicious menu. Luis was our server - great guy full of very helpful information (especially wine pairings). LOVE the lobster bisque (I'm usually not a fan of lobster or bisque). Amazing flavor combinations in everything we tried. I also love ending my meal with a perfect vanilla bean creme brulee. Highly recommend if you're bringing a newbie to Phoenix or if you'd like a romantic night out.
3 In my effort to live and love local, I try to show Bashas some love since they are a locally owned chain. Everything about this Bashas is just OK. The produce, inventory and service are all par but nothing stands out. I recently bought several baked goods from this Bashas for an event. I was on the hunt for sugar cookies that Santa's little elves could decorate during a shopping crawl. They didn't have any out, so I asked the lady behind the counter. She told me they had cookies in the back for a dollar a piece. This was too high for my budget so I politely declined. Then a couple minutes later, she came back and told me they were actually on sale and only $.50, so I decided to buy them. Coincidence that I said no to cookies for a $other and then they became 50 cents, or just oversight by the employee? Who knows.... During my visit, I also purchased some donuts. I need two dozen donuts and unfortunately they don't have donuts by the dozen pre-made so I ended up making my own. While this is good because you can choose your own, I think it would also be helpful to have pre-made dozens for those in a huge hurry (like I was that day). In summary, this Bashas is just OK, but I love supporting local so I will continue to shop here!
other Personally, I used to come here a lot more often than I do.  I've noticed, what I feel to be, a rather slide in the quality in the food.  The carne asada burrito I recently got tasted okay, but the meat tasted lesser quality than I was used to.  The guacamole was a bit thinner than i like.  I gave them this score due to them having much better history with me and I hope/think/suspect  they had a weak day.  If they do better or worse next time, I'll post something that will reflect it.
3 Love the atmosphere and how trendy rhus place is, reminds me of Nip/tuck kinda, the way they have it set up. I had thd NY strip steak and i don not think it was worth the price. The steak did not come with a side. Sides are ordered seperately. Great customer service, however I don't think I will be eating here again.
other Cute, small little place that I never noticed until a friend and I went one night for dinner. It's in a strip mall which doesn't really scream elegant, gourmet or even 'good' but this place reminded me of a place one would find in LA or NYC. As I mentioned, it's small. The restaurant is connected to a wine store that serves food as well. Kind of like Sportsman's. The menu changes a lot. It's a good deal to go for the four or seven course meal. Go hungry and take someone you'll enjoy spending 3+ hours with at the dinner table. What stands out in my mind is the dessert - which I'm not big on desserts - but it was a buttermilk pound cake with honey and light whipped cream and nectarines. Heavenly!
other This is my favorite Chipotle to go to because it's the closest one to my work. I call in orders all the time and the staff always has it ready to go. Even when I don't have a pick up order they always move quickly to get everyone through the line, which is great because when I'm hungry I want everyone out of my way!
other Don't dog Old Navy. Despite a sub par and semi-annoying marketing campaign, clothes here are aight with me. And where else can you get a perfectly good pair of cargos and boardshorts for less than thrity bucks a pop? I'm no fashion snob, but I like to think I can generally distinguish "awful" from "not awful" in most cases. For the "not awful" variety, Old Navy is dirt cheap and top notch.
other Fantastic experience from valet to dessert!! Boyfriend and I were both very impressed. We were graciously greeted the moment we walked in by a man in a suit who walked us to the restaurant. Our server was knowledgeable about all the items on the menu and suggested some things to try when we were waffling between a few different choices. Cheese trio platter was sooooo good. I'll be getting that every time we come here and it was the perfect size for the two of us to share. I had the beet salad which was very good. Love the candied walnuts in it. Boyfriend had the lamb which he said was perfect: Tender, juicy and delicious!  The breads that came at the beginning of the meal were obviously homemade and fresh. Even the coffee was good. It's very rare for us to find a place that does it right so completely but I think we've found it.  Service was fantastic! Our glasses were never empty and we were well attended without being pestered. Could it be possible I can't find anything to criticize?! I can't. Love this place.
other I've always wanted to go here.  The flames outside intrigued me.  So we went on Wednesday night around 8pm.  We were sat fairly quickly with no reservations for habachi.  Music is pumping, and the crowd is a bit older/slightly cougarish.The service was...OK. He went missing from time to time.  He brought me a diet coke after I had only taken a few sips out of my glass.  I must of gotten other new glasses by the end of the meal.Soup....is your basic mushroom miso soup.Salad...Tasty, spicy, had a nice kick.  Fresh crunchy greens.Fillet and Chicken....Eh....I found the flavors lacking, the steak a little chewy, and the chicken boring.  Even the dipping sauces were lacking.7other for dinner plus tip for two.  I think you can get better elsewhere.  Not worth the drive down to Scottsdale, find a local joint closer to home.
other i've never had a problem getting assistance here, except when it's busy, usually on a sat/sun. it's not that far from the house, maybe a mile, so i if i'm in a real bind, i come on by here to pick up some stuff. they've offered groupons here and with those, i've bought some power tools and hardware. ace brand is cheaper price but the quality seems to be just as good!
other The best Chinese restaurant in the east valley in all categories from Dium Sum to banquet style dinning. Their steamed fresh fish with ginger scallion is my favorite. I have been coming to this restaurant for other years and never had a bad meal. recently, they even invented some new dishes for the weekend luncheon carts.Tthe stir fired radish cake with bean spout is delicious!
other This is the very first time I have ever been in here.This location anyway, the first one was in downtown Seattle.  Yes, I came with my girlfriend. Both times,but it is a cool place for men as well.Samples of colonge, creams ,lotions and anything else you have ever wanted to try. They will even give you samples of things to take home. They will make you a sample of anything you would like to try.It can be challange to get inside the Scottsdale Mall at times.But, on this day it was not too bad,(during the week) and early in the day.It is a cool place,with lots to see and try. Loads of people wanting to help you as well.
other This was my second visit to Arriba's and believe me, it wasn't my choice. I spent the first 26 years of my life in Southern New Mexico and I miss the food like CRAZY, especially green chile. When you walk into Arriba's it's New Mexico this and New Mexico that and the dishes are named after cities and landmarks in the state.When we told the waitress that in New Mexico green chile sauce doesn't have pork in it she said, "Well, we say that but it's not *really* New Mexican" and walked off. What?!?!The first time there we mentioned this to a Manager and got the same exact reaction. I also asked if I could get a side of plain green chile and was told no. Both times we were being super nice and just trying to start a friendly conversation, had these interactions been better this review wouldn't be here.I'm far from being a vegetarian, I don't eat pork or beef because I don't like it. Also, I didn't ask about the red chile sauce because I'm not a fan, maybe it's porkless and amazing but I can't speak for that...I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken salad.  Iceberg lettuce, slimy greens, cooked onions and bell peppers, mushy tomatoes, half melted greasy cheese clumps and very dry chicken piled on a shell... yuck. If it wasn't for the delicious fresh chips, guacamole and two 99cent happy hour margaritas I would've been VERY unhappy.  I definitely won't ever be back and this time I mean it.
other Yum yum yum. Husband and I first went there early on a First Friday night and were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away. We didn't want anything too heavy since we were planning on doing some walking so we split the Spanish cheese plate which was delightful. The fig cake is delicious!! Splitting the plate made the bill pretty affordable and it was just enough to fill us up without overdoing it.The server was very helpful in suggesting a champagne for me and red wine for husband. Don't remember what we had but my champagne had a strawberry in it and was perfectly bubbly. Ambiance and decor is nice and mellow. We've since been back with friends and it has been enjoyable for both a date night and chatting it up with people. Enjoy!
other I heart Sky Harbor Airport Parking...Of course, it's always nice to find a ride to or from the airport but when you're all out of favors and you have only yourself to rely on, it comes down to driving yourself or getting a taxi.  Sky Harbor Parking to the rescue.  For $8 a day or cheaper if you print the coupons from their website, the folks at Sky Harbor Parking make it easy to drop your car and get to your gate in no time... and I've used them a handful of times solo and with the BF so I know it's door-to-door consistent service.  If you are interested in covered parking, call ahead, but otherwise, just drive over to Washington and 40th and they will take care of you from there.  Also, I recommend calling from the airport once you have your bags and they are always good about picking you up within minutes to take you back to your car.I hope you'll find Sky Harbor Airport Parking as useful and convenient as I do... safe travels!
3 Met a few friends here for happy hour.  They had $other martinis, but that's not what I ended up getting.  They have a drink special everyday.  That day they had the Walter Crankite, I think!  It was like an appletini with cranberry juice.  We didn't order anything else.  The service was great.  Our servere was very attentive.
other You'd think it would be easier to find good Chinese take-out but it's not..  Luckily, Great Wok fits the bill.  It's not super expensive, they give you a ton of food and it's really good!  I usually get the General Tso's chicken and it's hot, covered in sauce and cooked right.  The beef and broccoli is good too.  It's a typical small Chinese food joint in a strip mall so the dining room isn't anything special.  I stick with take-out.
other This is one of my favorite theaters.With that said, I suggest you prepare yourself for having to wade through an onslaught of pre-teen cliques if you plan on making your way to the ticket counter on a Friday or Saturday evening.If you're like me, safety is a concern.  Not to worry here.  I've always seen an officer on premises during the main drop-the-kids-off / pick-the-kids-up window.This location still has a new feeling to it, and it is clean and cool.  Nice cushy seats with cup holders, and I have yet to hear the soles of my shoes stick to the floor as I walk down an aisle.My favorite seats are the ones with the railing in front.  A place to perch my feet.-Swoop
other The bad: the bar closes at 10pm.  It seems like the western, country, wagon-wheel themed bar that you'd like to close down one night while playing some good tunes on the juke box and eating peanuts.  And also the french fries, file those under bad.The good: the hamburgers are pretty much delicious.  Definitely go for guacamole, and add whatever you want from the topping wagon.I didn't try one myself, but I hear the cookies are good.
other My boyfriend and I tried this place last year and we haven't been back since. The food was really unspectacular, they weren't really that hot. The price is a bit high since there's a restaurant by the same name on Southern and Dobson that serve much better food for less. The decor was really tacky and they should paint over the mural, it does not appeal to their clientele. Lastly, the staff was not nice.
other I eat here often and the lunch special is great!!  Food and service are equally good.  Fries are to die for.
3 Only had a chance to experience the Oscuro (amber lager) and the pizza (the Arizona vs. Boston) so far but it's enough to make me want to come back and try more.Lots of flat screens. Should be a great place to spend a Sunday afternoon watching footbal in the fall.
3 They are known for their CARNE ASASDA and it  does rock but dang this place was nickle and diming me at every turn!  Everything is ala carte, and the tacos are so small,3 bites and its done.For the price tag it should at least come with a small bag of chips.Honestly the chips were so average it was disappointing. the salsa that comes with it was mediocre considering the hold out factor applied.   The salsa that came with my  tacos was exceptional, that should be their signature salsa for everything.Sodas by the can, no refills,,geezzz,, another 3.00 bucks later.I think I ended up spending over $1other for 3 small tacos and small basket of chips, and other sodas in z can. For that price,  I want more atmosphere or at least a other bite taco.
other I think that most of the negative reviews I've read about this Gold's gym really stem from people's own insecurities. I have been going here almost other months now and have never had a single issue with the gym or ANY of its staff or members! I find the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful, and I was even offered a free personal training session when I signed up to help me get on the right track to meeting my fitness goals! I read one review about some poor girl stepping onto a treadmill that was going full speed and falling off... who does that?? Did she not see the treadmill going FULL SPEED? Don't blame lack of common sense on the gym or its staff...Another review complained that there are too many gay men hanging out in the locker room. REALLY? As a straight male, I can say that I've never felt uncomfortable, and have never been solicited for sex in the locker room. Get over yourself and your homophobia dude. Some yelpers truly disgust me....Great location in a beautiful new area, convenient hours, tons of parking, a BEAUTIFUL state of the art facility.... what is there to complain about?? Show up, work out hard, and go home feeling better about yourself... that's what gyms are for!!
other I like their seating area. It has a nice sized inside area and also a bright outside area that is tucked between a walkway and another store. One of my favorite locations.
other An unclear menu and chalkboard signage, as well as lack of information from our server, lead to confusion.Like most have said before, my friend and I were very pleased with the atmosphere at Tryst Café in terms of its decor and layout. However, information about specials on the menu and two separate chalkboards lead to confusion about what specials were available (given the day of the week and hour of the day.) When we inquired with our server, she didn't know and had to double check what was included, when specials were available and for what price. I'm not sure if she was new to this job or just insufficiently trained.Fortunately, Tryst Café delivered in other ways. The drinks were sufficiently strong. My friend tells me her two glasses of Montpellier Cabernet Savignon (pictured) were delicious. My Tryst Pepino was fine, though was missing the mint garnish described on their menu.The Humus Trio (pictured) was delicious and came with slices of fresh cucumber however, it did not come with the traditional side of pita bread which had to be ordered separately. The Steak Salad (pictured) was amazing and the chunks of meat were oh, so, tender and juicy!I hope to revisit Tryst Café sometime soon. My only hope is that they clear up some of the confusion about what specials are available and appropriately train their staff to know what is actually included, when specials are available and for what price.
3 Wow, it must be a first-time mall experience for the reviewer before me.  Five stars for Arrowhead?  Are you kidding?I find this mall to be average and boring with many middle of the road stores (Dillards, Sears, Gap, Tilly's, Forever 21) you can find elsewhere at other Westcor malls in the Valley.   Nothing really strikes me as distinctive at this mall - other than the fact that it's the nicer of two indoor shopping malls on the Westside.  So for 500,000 people this is the only game in town unless they're willing to drive east.The store mix and food court are pretty typical.  In fact, I rarely go here unless I am in the area, need socks or undershirts and/or I'm trying to avoid the lines of the other Arrowhead Paradise Bakery.
other Loved it! Best French toast ever!
other Dr. Dairiki is terrific. She is professional, listens to you and explains things so that you know exactly what she is talking about. I have never had to wait and the other thing I like is that she calls you back personally to let you know test results or if you have questions (plus it is done in a timely fashion.)
other I came in for a gift for my boyfriend's pleasure.  The lady working there answered my questions thoroughly and professionally.  Any shyness or awkwardness I might have felt disappeared.  I was prepared to spend more for a different product but was steered to a better choice by this lady.  Turns out, my boyfriend was very happy with his gift.  This was around Halloween so there were a lot more items than usual like costumes, pasties... fun things.  I can wholeheartedly recommend this Fascinations!
other This place is a dump. I'm a widow, and I have a long-term chronic condition, still, they allowed their tenant to pick on me, throw a bottle at me, then their maintenance person told me the lock was never changed, They did not paint, but lied and said they did. It's totally drug-infested, They don't keep their word.  I would skip it.
other this another place that i would give no stars to if possible. it's been on the corner of mill and university for as long as i can remember, which is impressive since nothing older than ten years has been able to withstand the rent increases, and even more impressive because i don't know a single person who goes there.i went in there one time, for drinks and walked past one of the foulest salad bars I've ever seen. for some reason, it's right by the door. instead of walking in to see a hostess stand you walk right into this brown mess of vegetables.after seeing that first off, i wouldn't dream of ordering food here. the place is also dark and dirty and there's never anyone inside of it.seriously, I'm really curious how this place survives. awesome little neighborhood wing and live music joints like long Wong's get torn down for high rise condos, yet gross, ghost town ruby Tuesdays hangs on the corner of main and main of Tempe. what is wrong with the world?
other I went today with three friends for dinner around 6 PM Sunday night. Though it seemed quite busy, I was pleased to get a seat within two minutes upon arrival. Outside seating, despite a hot Arizona summer, was pretty nice with shade. However, this is where the pleasanties end.Our table remain neglected for approximately twenty minutes. No one bothered to offer us drinks, and it was quite irritating to see tables who arrived after us being served appetizers. When our waiter came, he did not even apologize for the wait, and we gave our orders: drinks, appetizers, and pita sandwiches.The hummus and garlic dip came relatively quickly, only twenty minutes later. Both were alright, but something is seriously wrong if all of us were only served one pita with the two dips, and each dip was more than twice the size of the pita. We asked our waiter for extra pita, and he kindly agreed. The entire duration of dinner, it never came.Refills were also a pain, as we would ask someone to fetch our waiter, and he wouldn't come until ten minutes later.An hour after ordering could not possibly justify only four meager gyro sandwiches. I've been to plenty of other businesses who have made that kind of order and more in just ten minutes during a busy lunch hour. Half the tables outside already left, including tables that arrived after us, and we were the last ones served. The food was of average quality, and I've been to better with cheaper prices.Slightly expensive, I can see as justified. But many agree that time is worth much more than money. I had an excessive amount, over an hour and a half, wasted on a decellerating Sunday night. Staff is kind of nice, but I suggest a serious change in priorities so that first time customers like myself aren't immediately turned off. I can say for certain that I'm never coming here again, and I'll find myself at better places much closer to home.
other we celebrated my birthday all weekend.  we made the trek to bobby q on sunday. I ordered the brisket sandwich with mac and cheese and let me tell you about that mac & cheese..it was amazing. Mr H went with the chicken and brisket and for his sides: beans and potato salad.  The food is sinfully delicious! I will NOT be coming here as often as I would like... I found it too indulgent. it is definitely a treat and worth trying! I love those little donuts they give you at the end!
other Fast service, attentive waiter, food cooked as I ordered, clean restrooms...What more could I ask for? I was on my way to a meeting at the Marriott so I stopped in to grab lunch beforehand. I was in an out in less than 4other minutes. Perfect.I'll be back the next time I am at the Desert Ridge mall looking for a place to grab a quickbite to eat without ordering fast food.
other I found the food excellent, but keep in mind this isn't typically Mexican food this is Tex-Mex which is a whole different variety. Our waitress was fantastic, and talked me into getting the melted cheese on the side. It was quite tasty, indeed it has a bit of skin but generally if you cook cheese or milk included products into a liquid quickly it does get one..and personally I didn't haven't issue about it. The menu isn't extensive, it would be nice to have a bigger menu but with how accommodating the are, you could probably something off the wall and they'd be willing to do it.I ordered the bean and cheese burrito, which is delicious, and large. Its a fatty, and I loved it. When asked if they cook with lard the hostess had an immediate answer and listed what they used to cook everything with. I was so happy. Most have no idea, and aren't very polite if you ask. She was very friendly like everyone else we encountered there.I was told that the Steak was perfect, and mr.hard-to-please was filled up (had left overs) and stayed that way the rest of the night. Which was great. The salsa has an interesting flavor, and I must I dig it. I"m not a big fan of mexican rice so I didn't partake in eating it, however the fan of mexican rice at the table liked it, (but not as much as the fajitas) Conclusion - Excellent Staff, Great Food (Its Tex-Mex..not just Mex so bare that in mind. There is a difference!) Atmosphere reminds me of some place that would be placed in a Tarantino film. Price is average sit down if not a little high. Expect other people = over 30 dollars.
other Stayed here one night while traveling to Phoenix for business.  What a cool hotel!  I've never stayed anywhere like this.I didn't experience the 50's personally, but this place has really kept and captured that essence.  (And yes, it's been renovated.  This place was built in the 50's but it's not run down or anything like that.)The room was nice, the pool looked great (never got to go...), the service was impeccable, the food at Zuzu was very good.  Old town Scottsdale is right around the corner, with great restaurants and bars.  What's not to like?
other My super close, local taco shop. For me, consistency is key, and Filiberto's is always a step above most other restaurants ending with "to's" in that regard.  I'm fairly mental for their Chicken Soft Tacos on corn tortillas. Larger than a typical street taco, they are almost sized more like a mini burrito - Shredded Chicken, a red pepper sauce, lettuce, and melted cheddar = AWESOME. Tuesdays they are only $1, all day!  Finally their Adobada tacos are a bargain at thrice the price. Avoid the Chili Relleno burrito, however. It may be one of the worst things to ever get passed through a drive-thru window.
3 As good as it gets for Chinese food in Surprise right now.
other hamburgessa heaven.  Guac and bacon on a burger is ingenious.  I do wish they had some curly fries or something but the burgers cant be beat.  Also, the condiment BAR is brilliant
other It's brand new so it doesn't smell fishy yet.   It will soon just like all other Asian markets.Looks like they will have another place to eat inside but it's still under construction from what I can tell.They have Durian, I really want to try one because they are supposed to be so gross and stink to high heaven.Banana blossoms?  How would I cook those things.Food is divided into "Regions" so if you want Japanese noodles you go to one isle, Korean noodles in another isle etc.  It's a bit confusing but fun to look at all the different stuff.
other I am from New York and always asked where do I get best pizza? Hands down Lamps Pizzeria is the BEST!!!!!!  Always fresh ingredients and friendly staff and owner.
other This place made me feel comfortable about moving to Arizona.  I just moved from L.A. and was totally worried about not having access to Asian stuff.  Of course it is not comparable to L.A. but this place has all the essentials.*Vegetables = fresh*Meat = frozen*Fish = frozen*Dried food = plenty*Bread = they bring in baked goods from Olive Bakery in L.A.*Cooking supplies = half of the store is full of them
3 After checking into our lovely suite at the Montelucia my hubby said he was in the mood for some chips, guac and a margarita. I think he had mistaken Scottsdale for Mexico and unfortunately the restaurant at The Montelucia (Prado) had none of the above. Instead we enjoyed a glass of wine (Riesling for me), a bowl of gazpacho and shared the snapper ceviche.  Service was a bit on the slow side, but the tasty food made up for it...We ended up back at Prado the next morning for breakfast- we were quite starving after hiking Camelback (or part of Camelback).  I was a bit disappointed with their breakfast menu. They had very few things to choose from besides the $2other breakfast buffet. I wasn't in a buffet kind of mood, but it didn't seem like we had a choice. However, I seemed to get the most out of my $2other after stuffing my face with an omlette, mini breakfast burrito, fruit, yogurt parfait, etc.  Our waiter did a bit of a disappearing act, but fortunately we didn't need him much for the buffet.They do have some good food, but they could use some more options...and better service.
3 Sure the place has atmosphere and a good drink menu, but I prioritize the eats. We went on a Monday night for a friend's birthday with a semi-large group and they did a prixe-fix menu. I left hungry after paying more than the meal deserved. The bad: Shumai was just ok, duck mint salad had an unharmonious flavor and I refused to eat it, chicken with wasabi sauce was dried out, lychee wrapped bacon was soggy and a strange proportion, cream and goat cheese dessert with peach was not fun. The good: the Hong Kong rice noodles and fried tofu with pinapple sauce were the highlights and only things I would eat again. They were really tasty. But I won't be eating them again, because I don't plan to go back. I'm sure there's some gems here, as we found a few, but I need a better batting average and, oh, I dunno, to leave full with a few bucks left in my wallet?
3 So I started getting a cold yesterday and wanted some more soup it was late already 8pm so hunny went off on the search for soup since it was Mothers Day n' all. He ended up at Manuels dont ask me why!! Our white neighbor loves eating here, he had heard from somewhere or someone that they had the best albondiga (meatball) soup?! Well it was wayyy tooo salty other than that it was ok kinda spicey not too hot though. I don't eat meat but the kid liked the meatballs it looked like they had rice in them anh herbs too who'd a thunk. Chips were a tad too greasy and the salsa wasn't too bad good heat, beans were good rice was alright. If it is necessary and in a pinch again I'd go again but prob not.
other A yummy Mexican Sunnyslope dive.  The oatmeal horchata is tasty!  THE torta is really an experience!
other My boyfriend and I went to Film Bar last night to see Iron Sky. Neither of us had been there before, and the decision was made quickly, so we had no idea what to expect. The bartender was incredibly nice, friendly, informative, and genuine. The prices for the bar were very reasonable, and I thought that $7 for tickets was MORE than reasonable. We were there more than an hour early, and it was so nice to just sit back on the low booths and chat.I gotta admit, I totally fell in love with this little place, and I can't wait to go back!My ONLY concern is that by the time our movie was done, there was a DJ playing music so loudly that you could hear it in the theater and you couldn't talk without shouting in the bar, so we had to go outside to converse with our friends. I would bet that the place doesn't have a DJ all the time, though.
other The first time we tried this place, it was Saturday night and a 90 minute wait.  Declining to wait, we returned on a Wednesday night and sat outside, which was pleasant enough.  We were really looking forward to this based on Yelp reviews, but were all disappointed.   The tomato sauce had a very strong sage/thyme/oregano flavor that overrode the meager toppings.  The cheese was definitively not Italian - cheddar/mozzarella mix with very little flavor.  We also ordered the "Favorite Oregano Salad" which was another disappointment as  the raisins overwhelmed the subtleness of the feta and kalamata  olives.   We will not be back.  Can someone please tell me where to get a good Italian pizza in Scottsdale?
3 went midweek and were seated right awayTable was clean, service was adequate but food, meh.Hasbrowns barely cooked and no flavor and the famous biscuits were more like mini loaves of bread with no biscuit consistency and the gravy was honestly just blah.  After hearing such rave reviews I had to try it once but don't need to go back.  Kinda sad because I love breakfast.
other This place is fantastic. Great food, superior service, gorgeous decor... I had a Breakfast Casserole and a generous side of Cheesy Grits. My girlfriend had the Blue Plate Special which was a frittata. The Breakfast Casserole is a medley of sausage, roasted vegetables, and potatoes with cheese, topped with a poached egg. There were no overwhelmingly strong or weak flavors, and I didn't see any extra oil in the dish. It came with a side of toast. I chose the marble rye and was disappointed only to see that the butter it came with was a hard stick. The grits were definetly made with milk and butter and had some cheddar cheese sprinkled across the top. The grits were more solid than watery which was a big plus for me, as I prefer my grits closer to the drier end of the spectrum. After breakfast I ordered a bloody mary at the bar inside and it was spicy and delish, a really good balance of tomato to booze. I liked it a lot. What I liked the most, though, was the really good service and friendly attention we got from our server, the hostess, the bartender, the bar manager, the valet drivers, and even being greeted by the concierge and check-in when we weren't even staying at the hotel. I will definetly make it a point to come here again.
other OK OK... as a Proud Italian I hope my momma don't see this! I'm actually going to give D'moes a other star rating for a few reasons. Last Friday, me and my other brothers left the suns game, and proceed to put a few "adult" beverages back. At around 2am, when Haney's shut down, we had an overwhelming craving for crap pizza (its better than our normal Jack in Box at 3am run that usually ends up with someone puking in the drive thru line because the smell of the taco sauce is so amazing). Low and behold, the ONLY spot that was still taking orders (up to 2am!) was D'moes. Now, 1st off - I live at Summitt (by BOB). These guys gladly delivered to me, all the way down there! Major props for that. other - They understood me... considering I don't remember ordering the pizza (I woke up to pizza and wings boxes all over my pad, and me saying "who ordered pizza" then I burped... wing sauce and vodka is a healthy combo. 3 - apparently, after checking my voice mail, the driver was pounding on our door for about other minutes (we were REALLY jamming out to Rock Band, in case you don't know, were pretty awesome. Wikipedia that Ish ladies and Gent's; Kansas City Bullriders). Well, the driver and my door man both called 3 times. I'm assuming the driver eventually came in and grabbed the bass guitar and strummed it out. Maybe he had a slice with us? Who really knows these things. However, I do know that I was insanely impressed with D'moes... from the left overs I ate the next when I could remember. It was pretty darn good. Between the awesome'ness that is called "their customer service" and the legit taste it left in my mouth, I'm a believer, unless, if I say I'm not, will I get a commercial?... hmmmm.... Potential there....
other It was as good as everyone says!  And sooo inexpensive...appetizers, entrees, and drinks for 3 people...about 30 bones.  Not to mention the mountain of leftovers we brought home.
3 This is a great place to have a casual meal.  It's obviously a pub atmosphere but it's large enough to accommodate a lot of people without it getting crowded.  They also have many well placed flat screen tvs. (I just wish they would turn on the closed captioning!  Its one thing if you're watching a sporting event but when they have on an analysis show I want to hear the analysis!)   My husband had the beer sampler and enjoyed most of the varieties, the Raj IPA was his favorite (the 8th Street Ale and Kiltlifter are the more popular ones).  We had the soft pretzel appetizer which was ok, but I'm spoiled when it comes to pretzels having lived in Philly and lived on them for my entire college career.   I wish it came with a honey mustard to dip in and not just regular spicy mustard.  I had the French Dip which was solid - not the best I've had but still pretty good.  My husband had the Tap Room Tenderloin sandwich that he enjoyed - the onion straws and bleu cheese were a nice touch.Now this is just stupid.  (Saturday, 4/13) Ring ring ring. . ."Hello, Four Peaks""Hi, will you be showing the Red Sox/Yankees game?""Yes, definitely.""Even though it's being blacked out?""Blacked out?""Yeah, Fox won't be showing the game because the Diamondbacks game is on at the same time.  You're getting an east coast feed?  From NY or Boston?""Feed?""Yeah, you know, you're getting the broadcast from the Fox affiliate in NY or Boston?"". . .Um. . .we'll definitely be showing the game. . .""Ok. . ." Drive to Four Peaks"Hello! Welcome to Four Peaks!  Table for 2?""Yeah, somewhere we can see the Sox/Yankees game.""Oh sorry, it's being blacked out""What?!  But I called 1other minutes ago and you said you were showing it!""No sorry, that Diamondbacks game is on at the same time so we're not getting the Sox/Yankees game""THAT'S WHAT I SAID ON THE PHONE AND YOU SAID YOU WERE SHOWING IT!""Oh, well do you know who you talked to?""It wasn't you?!  I don't know!  Some moron who said you'd be showing the game!" You're not getting my business if you blatantly lie to me just to get me in the door.
other Sprouts is great, they have a wonderful selection of fruits and veggies and their sausage is made in house and really wonderful on the grill!  The grab and go meals are perfect for a quick dinner and the sandwiches and soups are spot on for lunch.  Very friendly and helpful staff.
other (aka. SKETCHY TEMPE with BONNIE G, Part One of Three)I was in Tempe. I was having coffee. I was sedate. I wanted to see if anyone wanted join me and discuss Kafka or something boring. And so I called up the town's most famous resident to see what was goin' down."Um, YOU need to see sketchy Tempe. It is time. And I will be the one who will show it to you. Meet me at Time Out Lounge. No, wait. Meet me at Monkey Pants. Yes, Monkey Pants!"And so I did. Monkey Pants! Sorry folks, but this name is nonsensically awesome. I walked in and sat myself at the round bar, joining a smattering of other patrons sitting there by themselves, each staring into nowhere in particular. Well drinks for $2.50, served in a standard kitchen glass. Nice! I proceeded to watch the football game and was soon joined by my Tempe tour guide.We were approached by the bartender to do discounted Patron shots....but only if we wore sombreros. There was barely anyone here on a Sunday night, and I'm of the kind who doesn't care anyway, and the thought of me and Bonnie G sitting at a desolate stripmall bar with sombreros on is kind of ridiculous and great at the same time, but shots were not on my agenda for the night. Alas.I then got a royal tour of the place, including the great leg lamp (actually it's two legs, not just one!), shuffleboard, pool tables, couches with a cozy fire being played on endless loop on a big screen TV, ample board games and another section with tables and chairs, which is where we sat, under the painting of the teddy bear in Richard Simmons gear. Other patrons were seated all over the large space, so everyone had their own private area in a way. I actually really dug this. I'm not one who needs a place to be crowded to enjoy myself or feel like "it's happening." Sitting around a fake fire with pints and board games with a few friends is more my speed these days anyway. So I may sound decrepit, but I'm really not that old. I swear.Sure, Monkey Pants has frat-party gimmicks throughout the day, but this place has no pretense whatsoever. How can you even take it seriously? Even it doesn't take itself seriously. I mean, it's just sitting there. In a strip mall. In Tempe. With a painting of a teddy bear wearing Richard Simmons workout gear on the wall and a stack of sombreros sitting next to a popcorn machine. Waiting for you to leave your critical mind behind and enjoy the now.And enjoy the now we did. All thanks to my Sketchy Tempe tour guide.other stars.(end of Part One)
other Stopped in for lunch with an old friend.  We had lots to catch up on, so got a booth inside where it was quieter.  The decor is true to Tom's heritage at this location, modernized with lots of historical pics on the wall.  The Governor's Room has an attractive gleaming golden state seal over the doorway.  Service was excellent.  Food was OK.  Great bar with Tom's specialties, where I don't water, so no info on that.  I should have had the 1929 chili, or a burger to really try the food.  I had a Cuban sandwich with house salad instead.  The salad greens were fresh, the tiny Tom atoes sweet and crunchy.  The sandwich was a Phoenix Arizona Cuban sandwich from Tom's Tavern, not like a Cuban sandwich made by somebody's Cuban mother or Abuelo using all the right Cuban ingredients.  Kind of like Mexican food in Yellowknife, Yukon Territory.  Good test.Next time I'm having the burger.  There will be a next time.Ambiance 1Service 1Cleanliness 1Cuban Sandwich 1
other Trust me... no one wants this place to do well more than me. However, after other visits I have to confess that it is a solid 2-stars. I'm confident in my comments... and maybe a little heartbroken.1. Loved Chef Wade Moises when he was at SASSI in Scottsdale. I'm a fan for god's sake.2. I'm a big pasta-crazed fool. Seriously love it.  3. Love dwntwn Phx.So what could go wrong? Service: No one to greet you properly at the door. The space is awkward enough as it is.  Staff was always inattentive and often seen hanging out at the bar. When asked why cocktails the "signature cocktails" took so long to prepare, the server responds clumsily "Because I had to read and learn how to make them just now." Yikes.Back to the greeting... We waited about other minutes in the doorway listening to staff sitting at the bar chat about how they hoped they could close early that night. It was only 4:30 pm.Vibe:The space feels cold and almost clinical. With the lack of fabric in the space, it feels like I'm the ER of a hospital (minus the curtains that surround each patient bed.) The staff certainly doesn't add warmth. Also reminds me of a corporate staff break room. Art on the walls is just bizarre (read other's comments.)The Cocktails:They look good on paper. See my comment above about Service. That's all I can really say. The Food:Each time, the Fritto Misto app ($9) was salty and sad to look at. Orecchiette with Sausage ($15) looks fantastic on paper, but never quite right. In fact, I've tried every pasta dish on the menu. I'm simply heartbroken. I crave handmade fresh pasta, but the pasta here just leaves me guessing... I'm I the odd ball out? Why do all these Yelpers love the pasta? It's wimpy and the proteins almost taste boiled (texture and flavor.) Approx quote from a guest, "gummy handmade pasta that looks like bloated playdoh in water." The sauces seem near amateur as if they were never tasted before serving. Usually on the salty side.Forget about portions, price, space, ambiance, whatever. The important question... DOES IT TASTE GOOD? Sadly, no.At each visit, I brought other notable chefs from the Valley. In one instance, the five of us ordered an entire dinner, ate a few bites of each dish, asked for the bill and decided to head next door to Sens for dinner (which is another review in the making.)I'll wait till sometime in the fall season before heading back to Pasta Bar. Maybe it needs more time (although it's been open for a few months already.) As always, I'd encourage you to try it out and make your own decision. Wade is a talented chef who can do amazing things in the kitchen. I have faith in you my friend!Side note... for those of you who fixate on butter and bread service at restaurants, do us all a favor and stick to your cheap filler salad bars. Bread and butter service is simply never worth commenting on as a crucial component of a meal unless it's stellar.  (BTW... I realize the irony of making commentary on the worthless comments)
other wow. this place is a gem.  highly recommend it if you're looking for a great place to take a date or chill with some friends out in the patio over some wine. visited friends in the phoenix area over thanksgiving vacation and they took us here on a Saturday night.  i dont know much about the chandler area but this place could easily rival any of the popular wine lounges here in san diego.  as for food, our group ordered a bunch of the bruschettas, flatbreads and a couple sandwiches to share family style.  we all enjoyed all of it, i especially recommend the fig chutney, that was absolutely amazing.  from the sandwiches, the shrimp blt definitely stuck out as my favorite.  overall, everything was very good and the service was great. as for the wine, great selection. the staff was very helpful in helping us pick out the perfect bottle based on what we like. in fact, i think i found my new favorite wine thanks to them.  if you're a wino like me, you'll love this place.  as for the ambiance, they nailed it.  awesome patio and great decor.  the attention to detail is definitely noticeable. very chill spot. ps. check out the door to their wine cellar, i want that in my house. it's gorgeous.
other We traveled from Anthem to find this little Turkish heaven.  The drive was worth it. Loved everything about this place from the service to the food! Definitely be back.
3 Hit or miss. Pretty much the perfect definition of the "HoHo". My friend and I like to come before shows and for happy hour (super cheap draft beers and wells), the well drinks are usually a little weak but being so cheap I can't blame them.Tuesday's are taco day and they have some pretty decent deals. Each day of the week has a "special" as far as food goes, it's average to below average bar food.There are some games and shuffleboard as mentioned in previous reviews. TVs scattered all along the sitting area and a sizeable patio for the smokers.The bartenders are the real hit or miss part of the experience. I've been here and had great service, I've returned to have sub-par service (it wasn't very busy).All in all, if you're looking for a place to grab some cheap beers (we're talking domestics on tap) before heading into The Clubhouse or heading to somewhere else to spend the night, stop in and check it out at least once.
other OK, I'm somewhat between 3 stars and other stars on this.  I really want to like this restaurant a lot so maybe I will have to return again and try another dish.Positives:Price!!!!  Wow, the prices are amazing.  I got the hand pulled spicy noodle dish ($4.00), my boyfriend got the hand pulled pork noodles ($5.95) and we shared the pork dumplings ($4.95).The dishes provided rather generous portions (we ended up taking half of our meals to go).  The dumplings were quite tasty (approx 8 large dumplings)I got the passion fruit smoothie with boba which was quite good (I love bubble tea so much and this place is pretty legit).The restaurant was really clean and the window to watch the noodles being made was really interesting and ingenious!Negatives:My noodle dish just really didn't have a whole lot of flavor and was not even remotely spicy for being titled 'spicy noodles.'  All of the food was really rather greasy.  The sauce for the noodles was pretty much pure oil and the dumplings/sauce were pretty oily too (but still tasty).  I was just hoping for a bit of a cleaner feeling meal instead of heavy greasy food.  Maybe if I try one of the soup dishes next time I will have better luck!  The experience was overall a good one and I would like to try this place again, I was just a bit disappointed with the grease content of the foods which gave me a bit of stomach ache.  Regardless, this place is worth a shot!
other I can't help but love this place. I've been going here since, quite literally, the day the opened. I move further away and I keep coming back.The staff is friendly, the food is delicious, the beer selection constantly rotates to new and interesting beers... and this is basically the de-facto hangout for climbers and cyclists! Really can't go wrong with this place.
other In my ongoing search for great Chinese food in Phoenix this place is a speed bump
other This place is a bit difficult to find granted but well worth the effort. If you're shopping down at the farmer's market, need a place to study, or just want to plop down with a good book, Fair Trade will caffeinate you as well as  feed you such tasties as quiches, stuffed croissants, cookies, bagels, and sandwiches.  The cafe was run by the church up until Julyish in answer to Mr. K's musing but they've been bought by a few of the regular customers and are enjoying a slow but steady revitalization along with a steady extension of hours.  They're also hopefully expanding they're menus to include more food food items as volume picks up. Additionally, they offer only fair trade coffee and teas so you can do your part to help fair trade just by sipping at a cup of coffee.
other My family and I ate here just a few days ago. It was an experience that left me yearning for more out of a restaurant I have seen so crowded over the years and decided to try with a group of 7 of us in the family. First off we got there at 10 am and were missing only two in our party so we had to wait to be seated which was fine. Once the rest of our party showed up at 10:07 we were not seated until after 10:30. When we were seated we were all scrunched together at a medium sized table that would comfortable seat other adults. Well, there were 7 of us total and needless to say it was very tight! The waitress stated that we could take our water and go wait back up front for a bigger table but we were looking at roughly 40 minutes of waiting again!!! Seriously? We ordered drinks first and the waitress brought my father his tomato juice and almost spilled it on him but instead spilled it all over her hand. Then she sat the glass down in front of him with juice on table and all over glass and left! She never came back with a wet towel to clean up her mess!! We all ordered and the food arrived quickly. This was the only part of the experience that was good, sadly to say. We received our food order for 7 of us within 15-20 minutes which was excellent. My uncle and grandmother both had charred toast (it was black, not just black around the edges) . The bacon looked like dried strips of hard leather. Overall, none of us will be returning to this place! It was is so overrated. We are headed back to RANDY'S here in Scottsdale to do our next family breakfast.
other Wed-Sat, sit at the bar and ask for bartender JOY. She's a GAS!Great spot for a late-afternoon glass of wine with an appetizer. Mostly poor execution from kitchen, excellent service.--hummus appetizer with sample of olives is great choice--crispy plantains with pepper are tasty and fun, crab dipping sauce, not enough crab--tuna salad with arugula, uninteresting--side salad for ciabatta "sandwich" typical Dole bag mix (first visit) was WILTED and nasty. Shame!--chicken salad with dried tomatoes and goat cheese; way too much cheeseNow, to Joy. She's a keeper. First visit, we struggled with the proper preparation of a Sapphire martini, but it was primarily the fault of our server's communication skills. Working with machine-made ice (you know, the stuff with all the flecks and shards that water down a proper martini), she primed the ice with a squeeze of lemon, drained, then prepped the glass with vermouth, in and out, then pour the STIRRED Sapphire in, drop twist! Congrats, my lady.If you can get past the chick-chosen wallpaper (wrong) and perfect-sphere fake tabletop plants from restoration, the different-height tables mix up the room just right and make it feels shabby chic without the white.Say hi to Joy. =)
other Eh... the food was good but not something I'd crave?  I had a chicken/swiss panini that evidently came with corn on it?EDIT: (actually it was the Adobe Panini: "Mesquite turkey, fresh mozzarella, green peppers, corn relish and chipotle mayo".  I got called out that there wasn't anything on the menu I said I ate, got it a little wrong but the review remains the same regardless. Here you go Bob M.)Slightly surprised on it but, can't complain... it was good but nothing great.They have subs and soups too - I'd go there again if friends were already going but def not somewhere I'd really mention when trying to think of somewhere to eat.
other Being Indian, and having grown up in London, I have been pretty spoilt for Indian food. Imagine my dismay when I moved to Phoenix! I've tried many different places here in town desperately trying to recapture the memory of a good London curry house but each time I've left either disappointed or clutching my guts fearing what may come.Couple of friends introduced me to this place a few months ago and I'm stoked. It's not as good as the stuff back home. And I'm sure you can get better in San Francisco or New York. But if you are looking for something closer to home you can't go wrong.Plus its got the real live Indians eating in there too. Can't be bad!!
other The best breakfast place, bar none!  I love that it is a local, non-chain place and they do everything delicious!!  The french toast is to die for and the plain and simple (eggs, bacon, potatoes) is perfect!  My husband and I split these two dishes and it is plenty.  We always leave stuffed!!  Be sure to make reservations for a Sat or Sun morning breakfast, otherwise you'll be waiting at least an hour!!
3 Lack-lusterI have been disappointed the two times I have visited Houston's.  Their veggie burger is soggy and grainy at the same time (I am not sure how they managed that)...not an appealing taste.  Their "famed" baked potato was dry and was nothing out of the ordinary.  Frankly, I could have made something better for myself and saved the money.  The redeeming factor was that the service was decent and the restaurant was semi-attractively decorated.  Overall I would not come back unless I have to (aka my friends drag me along)*** Was informed by a fellow yelper that the place re-opened down the block under a different name, HillstoneI hope the new name was followed by a new menu.
other WOW!!! A real European bakery!  This was awesome, after having lunch next door at La Buona Pasta we took home some kalachi's and walnut roll home for later.  The cakes are varied and everything looks buttery good and sweet.  Having grown up near a Swedish bakery it kind of remind me of that--donuts, cakes, cheesecakes, breads and other European specialties.  The shop is also set up with a small section of Polish-centric groceries.  mmmm maybe I will have to learn to cook some Polish dishes.  Next special occasion my cake is coming from there.  :-)The one we visited is 1333other W. Indian School Rd.Litchfield Park, AZ 85340 USA623-547-4655
other Doc and Edwards has been a place of refuge for other years for me.  Hell, most of my friends spent their 21st birthday there.  It is hard to explain walking into a bar and just feeling at home.  It is so comfortable and wide open.  Even on the most crowded days, I feel like I am on the cast of cheers.  The employees there are good and the food is exactly what you expect.  You can also order silvermine there with no delivery charge!  The pool table rates have gone up in the last few years but if you spend a good amount of money on drinks, they waive the pool table fee. Or you could go for some ping pong, foosball, UFC, or big buck hunting.  It has a great juke box but watch out for the lady that throws 20 in and slangs the worst playlist I have ever heard. If my girl would only let me, I would have my wedding there.
3 Could be because I've never met a bowl of pho I didn't like, but I could slurp this stuff up all day.  Viet Kitchen does a decent job with their pho; the broth is so delicious and soothing. I have only ever gotten pho at all the Vietnamese restaurants I've been to, and here's what I didn't like about Viet Kitchen's: the chicken is somewhat dry and tasteless.  The broth has a ton of flavor, so when you eat a piece of chicken with the broth it is fine. But to eat it alone, is way too plain. All they need to do is season it up a bit before cooking it. Also, the spring rolls were very fresh and great dipped in the sauce. Without the sauce, they would have been a bit dry, too. Overall, this is my go-to place for pho since it is so close to my house.
other Very good place for breakfast and their pies are to die for.  We've been here about five times and they never seem to be crowded, which is a shame.  Their staff is always friendly and the food is always good.  It's like a Dennys-type place, but I think the food tastes better.  I've honestly never had a lunch or dinner item but I don't think that's what you go here for :)  The prices are very reasonable.  Once again, pies are TO DIE FOR! We've had their strawberry pie (x2), pumpkin pie, peanut butter chocolate pie and most recently, their mixed berry pie.  We're going to be moving across the valley and I'm actually a little upset this location won't be coming with us.
3 I'm always on the lookout for a morning coffee place  and decided to stop at the Coffee Bean. Since I am always interested in trying new places, it looked inviting and clean, and was close to where I was going.They had the usual items you find in a coffee shop, and there was ample seating, with outside tables. That said, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. However, if I am in the area, and need coffee to drink while reading my newspaper, this is a good option.
other Oh good another Paradise Location for meeting up with friends after work. Clean neat and well manned , the worker bees seemed in real force, cleaning refilling and picking up plates. Nice to see. Food wasn't quite paradise but it was tasty and filling . I usually have the panini with chicken and artichoke but today went for a Chicken wrap.Tasted like a chicken wrap.  The peach decaf teas was refreshing and the mango tea was too. I love the casualness of the setting and the ease with which you can order at your leisure . If you are meeting people with different time constraints , this can be very helpful.
other Great margaritas, but kinda pricy for what they have. Their food isn't all that special :(
other Ben & Jerry's is still the best chain ice cream shop! The employees are always helpful and polite, and their flavors are just outrageous! The smell of the waffle cones and waffle bowls wafts out the doors as you walk by, and you can't resist. Whether you go for new flavors or classics like Cherry Garcia and Phish Food, you can expect the most flavorful ice cream with the perfect consistency.
other Best cheese steaks since the last time i was in Philly. Highly recommended
other My favorite restaurant in AZ, No Contest!!! Awesome staff, delicious food and the best salsa!!!!
3 Funny story about my experience at this place. My Classmate mentioned she loves this place for other reasons than my own. Yet, when we drove up it was very crowded and parking is minimal when you don't arrive early. We drove in separate cars and I called and asked her, "are you sure there is no where else we can hang out? It is super crowded. Yet, I am so glad she convinced me to go in and check it out. I suppose you ought to experience it at least once for a night out with friends. There were many different cultures/ethnic backgrounds. I very much enjoyed the band. They played some old school R&B from Next, Bobby Brown, Prince, Cameo and that's just some of what they performed. Excellent Band! The crowd was very pleasant and fun! I had to join in with dancing and singing. My rating review is 3.other stars. I would have to say that this venue is way too small for the amount of people it holds, the dance floor is super small, it's really dark and hard to move around even when you are dancing. The staff at Char's is friendly and I've heard the service is good. I didn't drink. So just word of mouth. I'm not sure if I would hang out there again. I would probably go only if I knew a friend/friends were here. That would still be a maybe. Although, I enjoyed the music, etc. I'm on the fence about Char's for some of the minuses that takes away from a place that could be so GREAT!
other Is it illegal to have good Chinese good in Arizona?  We went tonight having high hopes of having high quality, fresh Chinese food and we were sorely disappointed.:(We opened our take out bag and the white rice had been left off of the order...we were going to give them a pass for that...but on the flavor issue...there are no excuses...The Peeking Dumplings were wilted and flavorless.  The sauce that went with them could not revive them.  The Chinese mustard was in little packets and had no heat...Viagra needed:(!The Mongolian Beef was so salty it tasted processed.The snap peas were stringy and overcooked.The General Chow's Chicken...it tasted old like it was off an all you can eat buffet.Honestly...Panda Express is better...as least you know what to expect in a mall food court.It wasn't cheap...and I'm not a food volume person but the portions were small...I was fine with it because who would want more of this plate of shame!I hope they can get there act together...but I fear the owner may be in over his head...Isn't there a Chinese Chef in town who needs  a job!
other If you like a juicy sub and you don't mind onions... Ask for your sub to be made Mike's way! It's excellent.
other holy crap.  try the side order of garlic mushrooms.  they are little pieces of heaven that are such a delight to pop in your mouth.also, on the special menu right now there's a salad called the mediteranian chicken salad, which really truly may be the most incredible salad i've ever eaten in my life.  i wish i could drink the dressing that topped the impressive mix of greens, corn, roasted red peppers, cilantro, raisins, pine nuts, red onions, parsley, well-seasoned chicken, and i can't remember the rest.  omg.  beautiful.service was fine, not exceptional, but the staff was friendly enough.i'm so HAPPY i found this place.  go there.
other I would never have stopped at the Wy-Knot Cafe if it had not been for a friend mentioning it in a post on Facebook. I am glad I saw that post. There have been a number of restaurants in that location that have failed. Wy-Knot has opened the space up, made it dog friendly (it is named for their dog) and has a great menu. You order at the counter and then they bring the food out to you. The employees were all very friendly. The only down side was the lack of parking due to the other businesses sharing a lot. Also there were hardly any customers. Hopefully they will deliver menus to the houses in the neighborhood and maybe do some promotions on the neighborhood e-mail service so people will know what they have to offer. I would like to see them make it.They serve breakfast and lunch all day. They had a variety of choices and it was hard to decide on one. We split a BLT and a Chicken Salad Sandwich so we could try both. They come with a side of beet salad or salad of the day. The beet salad was very good. We both preferred the BLT but I am sure the Chicken Salad was more healthy and it was tasty as well.Give them a try, I think you will enjoy the Wy-Knot Cafe. I will be back.
other Those of us "foodies" know that if the company is not good, the food is not good...regardless...which is why I am happy to give Bar North such a great review.  I was there with a terrific group of people [STAR 1].  We were able to relax on the patio (with clean furniture, I might add) overlooking the fountains, in an intimate setting where we could hear one another [STAR 2].  The wine list was good, at a fair (i.e., expected) price [STAR 3].  The appetizers and salads were awesome [STAR 4].  And the waitstaff (Damn, I wish I could remember her name!) was incredible [STAR 5].  'nough said.
other luckily, i've only had to take my truck in for service once and had no issues with service or quality. it is always expensive to have something auto related repaired....wish i would've paid more attention during shop class in high school, but oh well...i can't be good at EVERYTHING.friendly staff. they called a few times to make sure i wanted them to proceed with repairs and had my truck done in a few hours.
3 3.other stars for me.  My first thought upon walking in was "wow, it's small."  Not a bad thing necessarily.  Could be a good thing in fact.I ordered a "Blushing Lady" cocktail (gin, Citronage, lemon juice, simple syrup, and a splash of sloe gin).  I'm pretty sure it was served in a dribble glass because I seemed to have difficulty actually consuming it.  But what I did have was perfect for me, and I would like another.I also opted for the special that evening which was a tenderloin sandwich with poblano, swiss, watercress, and charred onion.  While the poblano and onion sold me on it, I didn't quite get the swiss and watercress.  It was good, but could have been better with another cheese IMHO.  Also tried the herbed fries (delicious) and the mac 'n cheese (not as delicious).  The mac 'n cheese was good, but lacked the gooey cheesiness I crave.  We finished with warm doughnuts and salted butterscotch.  Doughnuts were fantastic, and it's hard not to like the butterscotch, but the "salted" part was missing.  A touch more please.I had kinda forgotten about The Grind, but now that I'm reminded of it, it's worth a second visit.
other I recently moved to the area of Westgate AMC and, even though it's not the closest, I thought I would give it a try. It's probably one of the most beautifully laid out and convenient movie houses I've been in. And for the first several visits, I didn't have too much of a bad experience. In fact, the only thing wrong was the ticket machines outside were down - apparently, I've heard that happens a lot, if they've ever worked.This last trip was just plain bad. I went to see Piranha 3D and the 3D screen was fairly small, especially for a wide release on opening night. The 3D was off a bit, but then that might be this old person's eyes; I could see shadows and lines behind some of the target objects.I arrived 4other minutes early and I mistakenly thought I would be too late to get a good seat for a 6:30 PM showing. By all means, I was approximately 30 minutes too early. They booked the showings way too close. The previous showing's credits ran until about 6:10, and then they, as always, took their time to clean out the theater. Once in, finally, the theatre was almost pitch black aside from dim lights on the staircases. The Pre-Show countdown, which I normally despise, would've been welcome, if just for some light. Well, that's why God made cell phones.Upon finally sitting, there were two soda pop cans in the two cup holders - way to go, clean-up crew. I literally saw 7 people leave the theatre when that showing ended. Cleaning up should've been quick so you can continue your discussion about who's ID you'd use to go out that night.But I digress, the soda pop cans were obviously not sold by the world's slowest concession employees. I just moved them over and the lights finally came on a bit roughly 7 minutes before the show. Typically, I hate when people have their cell phones lit up in the theatre, as they always want to hold them up high so the entire rest of the theatre gets the pleasure of the bright light while they babble on their ancient MySpace account. But, in this case, it's understandable as no one could see anything.Question, and I've always wanted to ask this, are the employees at the concession stand told to go as slow...as...possible? Fine, I know they're not - I'm a former AMC employee and I wasn't. Although, the pennies they generously give in the paychecks might not put the right fire under them. But seriously, it's already an insult that we have to pay about $13 just for one popcorn and one soda, but they add the salt, on the wound, that is, by making us wait 20 minutes in a line of 3 people.By God, I wish someone would open a concession stand with somewhat good deals - yeah, I know that's how they get their money, blah, blah, and I wish someone would open at least an express lane. "Two Items or Less Lane! No Children!" Heaven.Really, movies are still relevant, even in a down economy. Perhaps you should hire less and pay more. I'm sure the one guy at the box office would've appreciated that.
other If Cowboy Ciao is the best restaurant in Scottsdale then Cafe Carumba has to be just about the worst. This place is terrible. I went here with my family, and not a single one of us enjoyed our meal. The "handmade chips and salsa" were clearly store bought, and each of our entrees were consistently, blah. Nothing new or intriguing about any of their dishes, and the food just wasn't all that great. With so many great choices in Old Town, why would anyone ever eat here?
other My first visit was roughly two weeks ago when I got a Mediterranean pizza over lunch.  Service was friendly and prompt and the whole meal cost ~$4.Today, I stood around waiting for help for about other minutes without anyone so much as saying 'hi.'  One employee looked at me several times but ultimately went back to stocking shelves each time.  I could see people in the back and the general manager talking on his cell phone.  I decided to ultimately leave rather than waste any more time.  Disappointing at best.
other Finally!  A Chinese restaurant on the west side that's really good!  Understand they've been here a year - on a Saturday night at 6:30pm they were packed - at 7:15pm, they were practically empty.  Now you know when to arrive.Jo had Asparagas with Chicken and Shrimp, I had Kung Pao Beef...both excellent.  The spring rolls were very tasty.I'd consider other stars except for the waiter - too much of a hurry, put down the spring rolls without sauce or mustard, never asked if we wanted anything.  I watched other waiters and they were much more thorough, so we just caught a poor one.Go back again?  For sure!
3 First time ordering calamari salad...which had a strong onion (??) flavor and tasted weird...Being raised on Vietnamese food, the strangest of foods has been in my mouth, but I think this falls into the acquired taste category...As in I never acquired a taste for this.Pad thai was okay...the noodles were a bit over seasoned. I felt like I should've eaten it with rice to tone down the flavor.Papaya salad was good...still on the look out for that authentic not watered down version, though. Just like my friend's mom makes it! Yum!Thai omelet. Good.The people were really friendly as well, which helps, but you KNOW I'm all about the food.I had takeout and the box for the calamari salad read: "Carimali Salad". :) I love it!
3 This place is a hoot! A friend wanted to go to a movie that had been out for a while and it turned out that it was only still playing at this theater and one other. This is typically a $3 theater, we happened to go on a Tuesday and it turns out they have $other Tuesday so it was even cheaper. You definitely get what you pay for...this theater has been around for a while but it's a great deal compared to the average movie gong cost. The concessions are also reasonable cost. Not the most comfortable seats in the world but you get what you pay for.The reason this place is a hoot? There are crazy decorations, life size figurines, games, etc, everywhere. I am sure I only really saw about a third of the decorations because it is just sensory overload. I hear they really deck it out at Christmas.So if you are looking for an affordable movie night and don't mind the seats from 20+ years ago this is a good option.
other One of a kind place to experience all senses!!  Food was great, service was great, AND they have a Moroccan Healer on staff.  Ask to taste the Moroccan Black Stone (not on normal menu).  I won't spoil how it makes you feel, but trust me when I say you will enjoy yourself! ;)
3 We were visiting again, so of course that means at least other trips to Sugar Bowl!  The food, service and ice cream were good as always, but WOW, the prices sure have gone up.  I know that the economy sucks, but for what we got, the prices just don't seem to justify it.  We had different waitresses both times.  The fist was efficient but not very warm.  We had Sandra on our second visit - and YES, she remembered us again!  Could not believe it.  She is very friendly and can really keep up when they get swamped.  We will be back, but maybe only once per visit instead of other (or 3 or 4) times.  Just can't afford those prices for what you get.
other A total oasis from the summer heat.  This friendly and well stocked neighborhood library is never crowded, so you can alway grab a free PC or a free table if you're lugging your own laptop.  The selection of books and dvds are really good too.
other Went to this location last week - was nervous to go because although I love waffles, and fried chicken, the idea of eating them together freaked me out.  But my husband is a huge fan, so I decided to suck it up.  I'm glad I did... Although I typically prefer my waffles a little crispier than LoLo's makes them, the flavor was to die for!!!  And who doesn't love some delicious fried chicken!  I know I do.... Try it!  You'll love it!
other Great sliders, come on all you can eat night!  Bakery is awesome, ribs are ok, free breakfast on your bday!  No clue how adam richman did the slider challenge, I wanted to cry after 10.
other I came into this charming little establishment with a friend. We were sat pretty promptly and had drink orders taken. I had the iced green tea and she had water which was garnished with a slice of cucumber. I thought that was a nice touch. We both started with spring rolls - she had the salmon, I had the barbecue pork. Both looked good and mine was tasty. Then we had both had a bowl of chicken pho. It was really tasty, however expensive for pho at $10/bowl.That said,  the food was good. Not the best Vietnamese food I've ever had, but yummy just the same. My only gripes were the little things. I've worked in the back of the house for a long time. So I know how much it costs to put this food together.  I just felt like everything was expensive for what it was. This is not a high end restaurant. Its a teensy little hipsterish Vietnamese place with minimal decor. Its a lunch spot essentially. My menu was printed on paper which is pretty commonplace these days so no big whoop. Unfortunately the menu looked like it had been used about 50 times. I understand re-using menus. Its totally common. To NOT do so would be environmentally irresponsible. It just looked really, really used and abused. Also, my dipping sauce ramekin had a huge chip in it. To be fair, I am hyper critical of EVERYTHING when it comes to service just because I come from a restaurant background. Rice Paper gets 3 stars from me. It was eh... Luckily I had good company. I probably won't come here again though.
other other 1/other stars - really great place!  The decor is nice with cool artwork and beautiful flowers on every table, the service is friendly and food is authentic and delicious!  There happy hour specials are pretty good as well!
other I'm usually not a fan of indoor tanning but post baby I felt like I needed a little pick me up color. I chose this place because of their good prices- 3 tans in a lay down bed for 17 dollars. The staff is so amazing and friendly and I got a nice brown tint after a couple of sessions.
other AZ-88 is at once chic, urban, fun, and just enough Scottsdale without making me want to stab myself in the face, as a t-shirt-and-jeans-wearing, overweight guy.You'll first notice the atmosphere, and with good reason--it's perfectly lit, with noticeable but not mind-numbingly blaring music, and even better, they have a live DJ who goes through no small trouble to beat match and keep things rolling throughout your Wednesday-Saturday evening dining experience. When I first hit AZ-88, it had an enormous deconstructed NY taxicab suspended from the ceiling which was a fantastical conversation piece. The wall behind the bar was completely covered in names and numbers. (I was far too proud when I accurately guessed that they were the names of cabbies and the numbers were their license numbers.) Overall, a very different, fun look.Comfortable chairs and very full cocktails abound, and while they typically have a rock-steady delivery, more than a little cosmo has ended up in my friend's purse, to her chagrin. That aside, the food is fantastic and even though it's a bit hard to get out of here for under $30 per person (because you simply must try the cheesecake, and drinks are pushing $14), it's worth it as a classy-but-casual night out that you can really enjoy.They have a great patio, the burger is dripping with flavor (and, in fact, cheese), and they have waffle fries with pretty much everything. Great salads and sandwiches help round things out, and they ship their cheesecake in from Carnegie Deli in New York which is just about the most perfect cheesecake you'll have the good chance to try. Forget that Cheesecake Factory nonsense, these people know how a cheesecake is done. It is rich, thick, with just a hint of sour, and an amazing flavor that takes your tongue hostage and demands whipped cream ransom.Overall, a wonderful place for drinks and good food with friends, and the staff is pointed but efficient and will throw back any shit you give them, in good humor or, as appropriate, not. (We've never run afoul of that rule, but you wouldn't want to, I assure you.)
3 I love Greek food, but I need to stop letting my friends drag me to this restaurant. The staff is extremely friendly and the place is comfortable, but for me the food is always a disappointment. I know I know, it's a chain... and maybe I just have high expectations, being that I'm from back east where we have small family-run Greek restaurants on every corner.
other I used to be an avid shopper/seller at Buffalo Exchange. As I work at a boutique, it was nice that I could bring in brand-name merchandise and get cash for it when I needed it. The majority of the staff knew me and were always very friendly. I don't know if it's new managment or new policies but things have definitely changed around there. After yesterday's experience, I will definitely be taking my clothing somewhere else. First of all, the service took way too long. Secondly, the "buyer trainee" was unsure on about every single item I had brought in and priced a couple like-new $120-130 tshirts at about $20. The attitude of the staff is quite off-putting and it kind of makes it seem like it's such a task. However, they red-haired girl who was working by the fitting rooms was very friendly & helpful. I don't mean to sound like a hater, but as I was quite a loyal customer it was  quite a disappointment, especially in this economic crisis where customer service has never been more important than for those who work in retail.
other This is the BEST hit or miss bargain spot for everything. I frequently find great deals on quality body care products (be sure you know how to read the labels, there's a lot of low quality products in the mix), designer sun glasses, shoes, clothing, housewares, baby shower gifts, pet gifts, and guy gifts. It seems I go at peak hours, where lines are incredibly long. I see it as a small price for Macy's quality at a Walmart price.
other This is an awesome family owned business. We've had consistently fresh and delicious food each time we've been here. They homemake things like their ranch dressing to take them to a different level than other places. Highly recommend this place. Prices are not bad either.
other Truly a hiden gem in Chandler. Located south of Chandler Boulevard, just off of Roosevelt (next to Archery HeadQuarters). Wanda's is a small yet quaint, twelve tables inside and other outside. Outside is for sure seasonal, as summers are too hot and dead of winter can be too cold. Wait times on a Sunday or Saturday can be 10-1other minutes during the "rush times", which is a quarter the wait time you would experiece at the near-by chains. The menu offers a variety to satisfy and hunger (except if you want lunch on weekends, it's breakfast all day, lunch from 11-other during the week). The burritos are awesome. Ladies, I guarantee you will take half home! My husband likes the Biscuits and Gravy. The bacon is amazing and addicting often I have to smack my families hands away from grooping a piece. French toast, cinnamon raisin french toast and pancakes if you brought your sweet tooth =)   Build your omeltes are good too (tip, add a side of salsa, you won't be sorry, it is made fresh daily and goes perfect with a ham and cheese omelete). Service is exceptionally friendly, a lot of regulars and the servers know what you usually drink and sometimes can have your order written unless you throw a curve ball and veer from your usual. A+ Wanda!
other I have been patronizing Casey Moores for 10 years and have never had a bad night!  Great for people watching and the service is always great!  Get there early or it will be standing room only!
3 I only go here when my little cousin is in town and he adores this place. My cousin is other years old and obsessed with trains so he loves the small train display, the stationary trains you can walk through and the little train that goes around the park that you can ride on. A definite place to go with little kids especially if they like the trains.
other This review is for the bar ONLY! First time I came in here it was packed to this gills, and no where to sit so we left.. Next!Second time I came here I met other of the strangest old women I've ever encountered who tried to reel me into a marketing scam, wouldn't shut up about how lovely I was and how both of them wanted me as their daughter, then performed Reiki on me and my friend, waving their hands all around us eyes closed and chanting.. in front of the everyone. I couldn't help but bust out in laughter. Bartender laughed too, then poured more bourbon in my glass and winked.I really liked this place aside from the geriatric nonsense. Great vibe & I loved the entrance, you walk right through the kitchen and can observe the chefs working their magic. The interior is dark and sexy, with some of the coolest wallpaper I've ever seen.I am hoping to write an update soon, because I desperately want to try the steak that I have heard so much about, but $60 for dinner is a little out of my budget, thanks to our economical crisis and being unemployed. *sigh*
3 Sam is da man.I was very impressed with the fare here. I had a bowl with noodles and chicken on my first outing, and it was awesome. Another time I came I felt way hungry, so I ordered the SUMO bowl. Whoa. The bowl is a 3other oz bowl, I could have had it all chicken though. The beef is meh. I agree with another yelper that the eggrolls are subpar. They are grilled I guess? I dunno, lame. At another location they had these "carnival" cookies that were awesome. Another variety of cookies were the butterscotch. OMG. Amazin. So yes... Sam is da man.
other I LOVE this place..  This is my sushi bar.  Danny, one of the two sushi chef's is awesome.  I have always found their sushi to be very fresh.About a year ago they came out with a special sushi menu.  With rolls like these: Dirty Harry, Mr. Miagi, Rio, you cannot go wrong.  Especially if you like spicy (like me)!Even the non-sushi is great.  This is one place my 6 year old loves that doesn't have a drive through window.Also, $4.50 sake bombs!!!  $4.50!Go here.  Try it.  Don't be scared off by a couple of so-so (ok, other bad) reviews.  I am looking to even have a UYE here in the near future!  Should be getting a call tomorrow to get it scheduled.Almost forgot!  They have some big screen TV's!  Watch sports here!  They are hugely popular for UFC fights and football..  Just go.  Now..  Seriously.  Review part is over..  You are wasting time reading the fodder I have written here.  You could be finding your keys..  Putting on socks and shoes..  Hell, skip the socks..  Wear sandals.  Save time.
other I planned to order chocolate truffles from Truffle Trolley for our wedding favors.  We ordered the sample box to try them out.  They came in about a week and they were packed on ice which was really nice.  However, when we tried them, we just found them WAY too sweet!  We didn't like them so we are looking for something else.  Just make sure you try the chocolate before you buy to make sure you like it.
other Great great great tacos!I go to a restaurant for the food first.  As long as it is clean, and Lulu's is, then sitting in, what looks like a used McDonalds booth, doesn't bother me a bit.  Afterall, it's a taco shop!I like the fish tacos (the small ones) and I usually order 3 of them.  I like how they are made and it reminds me of what you can normally find in Mexico, not at these chain restaurants.The Ceviche tostada is really good too, but is difficult to eat, so don't wear your sunday best.Not in the mood for fish, then try the carne asada tacos or any other kind for that matter.Lulu's is a great place and a break from the Americanized Mexican Food, we see everyday.Enjoy it for what it is!
other Oh, how I miss this Goodwill store, which opened in September 2011. I moved to North Carolina in March 2012, and have not been able to find anything like it here. Large, clean, and very well organized, this store is thrift shop heaven. And it's all for a good cause: there's a job center right on site that helps people find work. Go on Thursdays, if you can, when a designated tag color is just $1. I've purchased a lot of name brand clothing here for $other per piece. You can also check out certain Saturdays when everything in the store is half price. I got a great mirror that matched the dresser in my guest bedroom for $12.50. This place is so good, I would not be writing this review if I still lived in Arizona, because I would want to keep all the bargains to myself.
other OH MAHHH GOSH, what retards they have working here. Came in to pay for my phone bill and literally stood in line for 40 effing minutes. They had TWO ppl out on the sales floor that afternoon and the store was freaking packed. Really? What genius decided to schedule TWO freaking meat-heads who knew diddly squat about anything on a busy Saturday afternoon??? And no, I don't care to upgrade my phone. I JUST WANT TO PAY FOR MY BILL AND GTFO OF THERE!!!! Do you really think that after such poor service I am going to want to up your commission rate by purchasing/upgrading my phone with you? NO.
other Groupon rip-off. Small salad, three extremely small plates of mediocre pasta desserts that cloyed the palate. All for an advertised value of $90. Will NEVER return.
other I live in the townhomes right next to this restaurant and it still took me 4-other months to actually try it. Absolute blasphemy as I see it now. This is a charming little place, decor outdated enough that it's sweet again, friendly servers, and man, great food. The pesto cream sauce ravioli (I believe) will blow you away. The wine glasses are filled high. Everything is great quality. Prices are medium-range, most dishes ranging from $11-18 but coming with a salad or soup and bread. This would be a great, great date night spot.
3 I always just get one thing from Vietnamese places and its their rice dish with grilled pork chop and egg cake. This place does it goooood. You get a reasonable amount for the price and the fish sauce is just right.
other I really enjoy this course but I am saving the other out of 5s for the Troons, Grayhawks and WeKoPas of the world.  Nonetheless, this is a great, very challenging course and you don't have to drive waaaay up north or east of Scottsdale to get there, which is always a great plus.  I remember Golf Digest did a list of Top 2other College Courses and this didn't make it, which I thought was nuts.  My only complaint is that the course isn't really as luxurious as the peak season rate would indicate.  Also, as the other guys who reviewed this mentioned, there is some fantastic ASU swag available in the shop if you are a fan, they probably have every variety you could ever imagine.  Haven't eaten there but Ted's Hot Dogs is close enough that you'd be crazy not to go there after your round.
other These are not real French treats. I'm surprised some of the reviewers say they've been to Paris. First of all, they're not macaroons (those are Jewish coconut cookies) they are macarons (one "o") and these were the most amateur macarons I've seen. The feet are big (the feet are the rim of the cookie) and the cookie body itsself is airy and thin whereas a true macaron is light but doesn't actually have air pockets in it (the cookie dough is still present throughout). The filling is not ganache like it should be - it's a buttercream like you use for cupcakes. Chocolate croissant was decent so I'll add a star for that.
other Just as good a Pizzeria Bianco! But with the added bonus of not having to wait for hours and hours. Granted there may still be a wait here but you aren't fighting tourist for tables at this joint. It's more of a local fav! Fresh gourmet toppings and very good crust! Personally a big fan of the garden seating! There was a longer than normal wait for the food however, the server was very attentive and I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance as we had drinks in garden. I would not recommend this place for a quick meal but it's perfect if you bring friends and want to have time to relax and enjoy conversation!
other I love Macy's! My mom & I can spend some serious dough here on just a few tops, but it's so worth it! They have sales often, but it's funny how we always like the ones that are full price. Aside from the women's section, their men's section is decent (bought my hubby some denim shorts on clearance for $20 each), shoe section is just ok, Coach bags are to die for & we love their jewelry section (particularly Betsey Johnson stuff!). My mom has a Macy's card so there are usually great savings when she uses it & they send her coupons all the time!
other Three words: THAI. TUNA. ROLL.Get it. You won't be disappointed.  In addition, the California and the Mango Salmon Rolls were quite good as well.  While Arizona isn't a place known for stand-out sushi, I'd order it here again.  And in fact I did...two nights in a row. Night #other - The bartender was a superb professional. He replaced drink napkins when they were damp and even poured my martini into a fresh cold glass when I was half-way done.  Class act.  He was also the one who recommended the Thai Tuna Roll which adds even more points to his score, if possible.  Night #other - CRANKY bartender. While she recommended a nice glass of white wine, she poured me a totally different one the second time.  While it was St Patrick's Day, it's not like this place was packed out with annoying patrons so I'm not sure what put her in such a bad place. It did leave me with a not-so-happy feeling when I left, despite the fact that the food was just as good as the first go-around.  So, what could be the only gripes aside from the attitude?  * You will pay a chunk of change for your meal here (but it will likely be worth it) * You will also likely order something that they're out of (mango salmon roll the first night, grilled artichoke the second night, and every night I've ever gone to a Hillstone, for that matter)* It's a chainBottom line is that Hillstone is probably one of the better options in this neck of the woods.  Go for a cocktail and a Thai Tuna Roll, if nothing else.
other It's the middle of January and 7other degrees out.  While there's no shortage of things to do outside, there aren't many dog-friendly places for that where you can sit down and eat.Jacqui J and I took out doggies to the dog park.  They're bruthas, you see, and hadn't hung out in awhile.  We had MLK day off together and spend the afternoon together.  Trying to decide where to eat with the pooches, I thought of TMI because I had seen so many people recently check in on Yelp.  Their patio is pretty big and mostly shaded.  This wasn't a day to be too concerned about shade, since it wasn't hot out.  I read the reviews ahead of time and already knew what I wanted before I even got there.  I was happy to have to take home a doggie bag, too.  I got the olives, red goat salad and the mac and cheese.  I will eat anything that includes green chiles in it.  Anything.  A few varieties of olives were served wtih fresh herbs and a dash an oil & vinegar.  I love all olives and don't always buy them for home, so it was a real treat.  They came in a little bowl, but there were about 20 of them.  The red goat salad was perfect: tons of pistachios on it, big chunks of goat cheese and strawberries.And den...and den...the mac and cheese, generously stuffed with chopped green chiles, ooey-gooey melted cheese that was crusty on the edges, the way it's supposed to be.I'll be back with Dexter.  They gave him a treat.  Oh, and my meal was treat.  I'm burping up the leftovers as I type this.
other I've been here a couple of times.  The first time was on first fridays.  I expected it to be packed, but I was able to walk right in and be seated.  They had a table reserved and they must not have shown, so we lucked out.  I got the Sante Fe, a roast beef panini, and it was great.  They had some good beers on tap too.  Its a cool little funky place to grab a good sandwhich.  The second time I came here it was after a concert.  There was some horrible band playing that I wish would have shut up so I could hear the people in front of me without having to feel sharp pains in my ear, but the meal was still good and I liked it.  Any place that is open late close to downtown is perfect, especially since the kitchen doesn't close until 12:30
other I stopped by early this morning to satisfy my crave for something new. The place is very clean and a man came out to greet me and was ready to serve. He clearly explained every item I was curious about since the labels were in Spanish. I asked if his name was Miguel and he said yes. I told him I read about his bakery on Yelp. Then he said that he loves Yelp and that's how word is going around now for him and he also uses to find reviews on other places. He was very friendly and had lots of patience. I was the only customer at the time and he actually doesn't mind having a conversation unlike open ended talks with others. I ended up buying 10 pastries and it cost $6.80. What a great deal!They also sell other items such as tamales, burritos, and menudo. I inquired about the burritos cuz I like mine with a little kick,but unfortunately they weren't ready yet. He showed me the homemade tortillas and he says he used them on the burritos. He said they don't look big, but he assured that the burritos are filled with red (mild) or green (with a kick) chili, shredded pork, and some potatoes. He said that one burrito is good to fill up a person. So...I must come back and try it. So far I've had the flaky pastry with the shredded coconut and Bavarian cream...the Bavarian wasn't as creamy than I'm used to. I almost thought it would have been better off to not have it, but it's a nice added flavor when you eat it all together rather than just tasting the Bavarian on its on. I had that curvy, pretty looking pastry which is topped with crystal sugars and with all the sugar on top, I thought it might be too sweet, but nope. It was just fine with the pineapple filling (excuse me as I wipe my drool). Then it was off to have the caramel flautas dusted with powdered sugar. The first bite was eh. The second bite was...um. Third bite, WOW! I finally reached the part that had more caramel in it and I LOVE IT!!! Did I mention that I'm not a big fan of caramel? This caramel is sweet and creamy. It's just so good! A definitely must have for next time.That's about as much my tummy let me eat for today. I'm sure the rest will be just as good and I can't wait till tomorrow morning to try to rest of my goodies.
3 This airport is the most confusing airport I've ever been to.  Obviously it was meant to be small and was originally probably very efficient, but since they have added terminals it makes no sense and you will see the sign you need as you are passing it, instead of having a sign a mile or so ahead telling you were to go.
other Awesome pool.
other A few co-workers and I were in town for a conference and decided to check out this place on a Tuesday for lunch.  Service was fast and the sandwiches were good.  The bread was fresh...I would suggest splitting because a whole sandwich is just too much for a regular appetite.
other I love Dr. Scott!! He is the funniest doctor I've ever met and he makes me feel good too! Dr. Scott is always willing to bend over backwards to make sure you are provided the best service and treatment possible. The massage therapists rock too! I will be a lifelong patient of Integrated Chiropractic.
other Fun atmosphere, great H/Hour prices. We took my 89 year old padre there and he had a ball looking at all of the stuffed animals. Had the fried shrimp, curds (what are curds really?) and the burger/brats and beer for only $6. Asked for med. rare on the burger, but it came out medium, no pink. I will try rare next time. 3 Blind Moose house wine for 3 bucks. 3-7pm everyday, life is good in Scottsdale.Stay thirsty my friends!
3 I've been to Orange Table a few times and adore the venue, grocery and store. However, I have been less than impressed with the food. The first time I went for breakfast and had the Jersey Girl Omelet. It was good but not great. The next timeI had the mushroom pizza. It was so greasy that I had to go through multiple napkins and could only eat 1-other small pieces before I gave it all to my friends.To sum it up, if you are looking for a chill place to hang out, people watch and do some small gift shopping it is a great place but don't do there for the food.
other Bison Witches is a bit religious for me.  The hearth is in Tucson, but they did a good job of transplanting the same food experience to Tempe. Their filling sandwiches offer a sort of primitive bliss with the roughly-cut thick slices of bread - best tip is to go with the half sandwich/half soup (their half is really a whole) - Their chili is the best thing going...
other I'm almost hesitant to tell you about my favorite sushi place because it's already pretty busy...  But oh well.  I love Sakana.  It's a comfortable restaurant, I don't feel like I have to get all dressed up to go there.  Don't let the fact that it's in a strip mall turn you off, inside is small, but nice.  Their sushi chefs are always very professional and keep their bar very clean- that's so important when dealing wih sashimi.  We've taken a lot of people to Sakana and it has never disappointed.  We have tried almost all their special rolls and love their sashimi too.  Their service staff are authentic and sweet.   I've never been disappointed.Now....stay away...cause I don't want to wait for a table....
other By far the best taco shop in the valley. Their rolled tacos are delicious. I've had them dozens of time and they never disappoint. The restaurant is older and what you'd expect of a normal "taco shop", but it is very clean and the staff is always very friendly. They also have the best red hot sauce I've tasted yet. Yuuuuuuum.
other Of course, they are no La Madeliene, but if you are looking for some good croissants, this is the place to be. I love, love, love their croissants. But which bakery's croissants do I not love? hmm... But I do love theirs. I have had the almond croissant, the almond and chocolate croissant and finally today when we went there, I had the chocolate croissant. It was just freaking amazing. That's all I can say. (They run out of the chocolate almond croissants pretty quickly so go early if you want some)I have also had lunch here before, some Mediterranean sandwich stuff. The portion is very small compared to the price. Their macaroons look crazy and funky. Have not tried them yet but plan on doing so next time. I almost gave them other stars because their hours they are open are very weird. But its okay, I will compromise Essence Bakery. They only use butter imported from Normandy in their Croissants. Wow.
other The food is fantastic, the staff is helpful and the atmosphere is comfortable. The food at El Bravo just tastes better than the food at any other Mexican restaurant I have been to in Phoenix, regardless of price. The cheese is amazing! I love their flour tortilla flautas , crispy beef tacos, cheese crisps, enchiladas (I could go on and on). I really can see no reason to go anywhere else in Phoenix for Mexican food. I highly recommend El Bravo.
other Unlike other airports I've been in where your options for food are your massive conglomerate chain restaurants like McDonald's and Burger King, Sky Harbor has a nice array of more local, higher quality restaurants for you to choose from (e.g., La Grande Orange, Olive and Ivy, Barrio Cafe), as well as some healthier choices compared to eating a greasy burger and fries (e.g., Paradise Bakery).  There are a lot of good parking options, whether you choose the airport's own parking lot or private lots that provide shuttle service.  I also appreciate the free wi-fi, it definitely helps whittle the time away while you are waiting for your flight!
other What an amazing Mini Vacation.  I went in August which was about 10other degrees but it was perfect.  The pool was relaxing, the water felt great and I enjoyed all three nights of my stay.  We decided it was so great we never left the resort.  The Room was very clean and very comfortable.  Talavera had the most amazing Fish Entrees, the seabase OMG I can still taste it, the salmon was the best I have ever had, and I dislike salmon completely.  The service through out the restaurant and hotel was amazing.  The special drinks they had were very tasty and made the 10other degrees weather manageable.  The brunch buffet and breakfast at Crescent Moon is excellent all three days, so fresh, the pomegranate fresh juice was amazing I had three.  The food tasted like the items were freshly picked that morning.  I literally gained other ILBs on this trip and it was worth all of it.  The Lounge had tasty small Tapas which I enjoyed while it drizzled that night, the whole hotel has a great relaxing ambiance.The nights were amazing to walk around the hotel or sit around the pool with the night lights on and enjoy the peacefulness of the resort.  I believe we saw bats flying around in the middle of the night. which was very cool.  Worth every penny.  Just watch out for Camera Speed Traps on the way there.  Enjoy,
other Why pay full price for men's clothing when you can find quality used items here? Well Suited consistently has an excellent selection of suits, sportcoats, slacks, dress shirts and golf shirts. You can also trade in your old clothing for store credit or cash. The credit is good at any of the different stores in the My Sister's Closet chain, including all of their stores that carry men's and women's clothes, furniture and kid's apparel, furniture and toys.
other My wife and I have stayed in many hotels both domestic and international. From cheap hotels to very expensive resorts. For the price this hotel was a great deal. Very clean and friendly staff. Very close to the airport and provides FREE shuttle to/from airport.
other The whole market is awesome.I like that if you did not bring enough cash with you that you can pick up a blue ticket at the information booth that the vender will stamp then hold your items for you then you may pay by credit card at the information table where you picked up your ticket.The veg are great.the free range eggs are the best.the french baker from Tucson is pretty darn good.this market is for sure one of the better ones I have seen.worth any one checking out.Note support your local produce and growers/farmers.Support Organic!! One more note this information and option has to do with the farmers market out side open on the weekend from 7am to 11am
3 After hitting up the bank to sign some paper work, I wanted to stop by the Biltmore for a quick lunch and had Paradise Bakery in mind.  As I was making my way through, I encountered a new facade with Southwestern designs that I have never seen before.  "Cool!" as I exclaimed to myself. It looked intriguing enough that I went in to ask the hostess for a menu.  After gazing around for a few minutes, the Chimichanga Entrée caught my attention! Content I was! j'adore Chimis!After being seated in the, rather blandish, outdoor patio area with mistifiers cooling away, I put in my order: a Chimi and an Arnold Palmer.Not too long, my waitress brought out some cool, fresh salsa and chips.  Nothing too dazzling, quite ordinary.  Chips were crispy, oily, and a tad salty.  Arnold palmer seemed to lack both the sweetness and citrus.Now come the Chimi with a side of rice and beans.  Typical Mexican, you would think right? Well, up until I took my first bite into the rice! Puzzled face I was--like an Anime character.  I steadily kept taking small bites after small bites, analyzing what in the heck I was eating.  Generally, it was just sweet and overpowering what I would think a Mexican rice should be.  The corn bits probably only enhanced the sweetness further! The waitress confirmed honey was used but I initially guessed coconut!The beans with pieces of bacon was just simple and watery.  At first, it seemed to have that smoky, cowboy-ish hint to it, but fell short of a decent side.The Chimi was quite underwhelming in its overall taste.  What blanketed this deep-fried burrito were green chili (tasteless for the most part), drizzle of this sweet white cream (unsure of what), and some white cheese (unsure).  The tortilla shell was crisped enough and the chicken shred lacked the savoriness that I would have expected from a true Mexican joint.Nothing made sense to me! Where was the Mexican? I tried very hard to find the positive in my meal.  I quit half way to be honest.  I hate to mention this, but I did garbled some of what I chewed back out to my plate.  Overall, it missed the savoriness that would have saved the meal.  I desperately wanted Tabasco sauce like it was the end of the world, but unfortunately it was too late.I explained my calm, analytical dining experience to my waitress and she was very understanding and was fine with removing the item from the bill.  5-stars for that.I really am unsure of returning as first impression is a pretty big deal to me.  The happy hour menu did not look that appealing either.I guess the question is, how much can you expect out of Mexican-esque establishment that sits on a Fashion Park?  Heed, heed, heed this review.
other I've only had a baguette once but never again, it almost made my gums bleed!However, ever since they opened I've been a fan of their most delectable croissant sandwiches. Great prices and awesome drinks. Suckks they don't take card but still worth it.
other The Menu here is great.  So much to choose from and its always good.  No mater which location we visit our service is always good and we never have to wait long to be seated.  The Jambalaya is a big favorite, and the pizza here is awesome.  I've also noticed that they have improved the drink menu quite a bit
3 Had a coupon so decided to have lunch at Wildflower. The food was pretty good, similar to other specialty bakeries. The cashier was not super friendly, but the manager was. Would go back, just felt that nothing overly stood out about this place.
3 The place was pretty empty - even for an off night. The service was pretty decent, but like I said - it was empty. I've been in here a few times, but never when it's busy. The prices don't impress me, but I'd say you get a pretty decent pour for the money. One thing I'd like to point out - a 1.5L bottle of Dom is less than 1000 bucks, but a 3.0L bottle of Dom is 3500. If you're a fucking idiot, get the 3L. If you're a smart shopper, you'll get two 1.5L bottles or else just by the glass - which works out even cheaper. Just so you know, it works the opposite way Costco does. If you're getting a big ass bottle of Dom anyway, you probably don't care.The decor is red. It's very dark in here at night... dark and loungy rather than clubby. Similar to Merc Bar, but not as hip or hidden... even though they try to hide it with curtains. It's also pleasantly quiet in here... easy to have conversations. With the patio door open, you're going to smell cigarettes people are smoking outside if you're sitting at the bar or on the couch adjacent to there. It's a nice bar, but I don't know that I'd single it out as a "place to be." I actually think the Mondrian is pretty nice - but that's based entirely on good memories that are completely unrelated to the place and have more to do with the people I was with at the time. If someone wealthy and hip was here from out of town looking to party, the Mondrian is one of a handful of hotels I'd suggest. Not so much because of Red Bar, but more because it's conveniently located within stumbling home distance to so many other better bars in Downtown.
other Have eaten here several times.  Always amazing.
other If you work in an office and have to dress business casual, NY & Co is your place to shop. Some of their stuff can be a bit plain but more often then not, they have modest, cute, stylish, business casual clothes at an affordable price. I don't think I have ever been bugged by a salesperson when coming to this store which is actually kinda nice. I can't stand salespeople following me around chiming in about how cute something is (see my review on Coach in LV). Lastly, they have a great display of accent jewelry which is my weakness. Everything is always really different and fun so I can't resist and usually walk out with several pieces. The next time you are trying to find a place to shop, try NY & Co. There is something for everybody   :)
other The pho was good and a generous portion, but compared to most Vietnamese places... way over priced. The owner is very nice and entertaining :) The spring rolls were decent, but smaller than most places for the price. It still beats anything in the west valley.
other Ordered the pork ramen and a rainbow roll. Both were great, sushi was like every other good sushi place and pork ramen was tasty and spicey. Good service from waiter but the hostesses weren't able to keep up with everyone and forgot we were there and had us wait awhile. Other than that, experience was good and would come back.
other I had been wanting to come back for a while.  I love this restaurant.  Last night we had a magnificent meal.  I started with the St. Francis Lemonade, a perfect cocktail to start your meal.  There are so many wonderful choices.  They are featuring a special menu for New Years, however you can order from it "a la carte", so we decided to start with the Arizona Citrus Salad.  It was delicious.  I love the combination of dates, goat cheese and orange slices.  I also chose from the special menu the sea scallops.  WOW, they were so sweet and tender.  They were served over a bed of black lentils, so amazing.  The portion was generous, other scallops, I am glad I didn't order the side of sweet corn polenta.  I ended up ordering dessert (yes my hubby twisted my arm, NOT).  I had the usual, Sticky Toffee Pudding and my hubby had the Chocolate Stout Cake.  I had a bite of his and it was great.  I cannot guarantee I won't stick to my usual dessert, but it was a closed one.  I wish this restaurant was closer to where I live.  It is such a great place.
other This cute little neighborhood breakfast/lunch spot just opened up, and is the sister restaurant to Tuck Shop.  The menu is small with super reasonable prices!!  Not much in the way of vegan fare, but I managed to find a tasty dish: The Red Flannel Hash (beet, potato and root vegetable hash sans eggs).  It was very tasty and had a nice amount of black pepper in it.  I also ordered a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice for a grand total $8 and change.  Not too shabby for brekky.  My dining cohorts ordered a frittata topped with sour cream and chives, a Portuguese doughnut and biscuits stuffed with some kind of meat (I forget the name of this dish) and were equally pleased with their meal.Not sure about parking, as we walked over (so awesome!) from their house.  This is a quaint little gem with indoor and outdoor seating.  They also have booze, so you can add a little pizazz to your wake up call.  Great place, can't wait to come back!
3 I have been to this restaurant several times.  I can say it has been better each time with the first time being absolutely terrible.  Why did I return?  Because I was with a friend who wanted to try it and I couldn't believe it would be so bad the second time.  It was a bit better and most recently it was good.  The hostess initially was very "French" in that she was affected and snooty and yes, a young American woman.  Initially we had a very bad experience with a fire alarm that continually went off, the staff didn't apologize and did not comp us anything.  Other diners just left without paying or waiting for their meal.  It has since been better, but I certainly am reluctant to return.  There are many other restaurants from which to chose!
3 I'm somewhere in between three and four stars. And, I know there are Yelp "Talk" events taking place right this very second as I sit to type my review, and it is for this reason I appreciate what anonymity I have so I won't be egged as I walk out my door in the morning. And, it is possible that I expected something earth shattering within the vicinity of so much greatness (read: Pizzeria Bianco)First of all - I had to approach the bar for service, refills and a check. Granted there was one guy running the place at 3:30 in the afternoon, but my friends and I were three of five people at the entire property. They weren't busy. We sat out on the patio and watched all the folks across the walkway start to congregate outside Pizzeria Bianco in the rain. It was an unbelievable an hour and a half prior to opening, they have at least two seatings of Guests waiting in the rain - I swear there's got to be something addictive in that crust. I love Bianco, I do, but I am also (sometimes) very logical. Show up at other p.m., go find a great patio table at the Rose and Crown, or Bar Bianco and have some wine for a couple of hours prior to dinner - don't stand in the rain for an hour and a half!But, I digress...we're discussing the Rose and the Crown. Okay. Cute, compartmentalized rooms, yes. Homey feel, yes. Good selection of beer, yes. Good wine, no. Well made cocktails, yes. Menu, eh, okay. Service, eh, poor to okay.  Patio seats, rocking good! The trees changing colors, yellow leaves everywhere, perfect. People watching, phenomenal. Fish and Chips, pretty good. The friends I shared the experience with, too good to be true!
3 I just don't think I'm much of a brewery gal. Granted, the beer here blows Four Peaks out of the water, but I'd much rather have a nice cocktail than chew though a specialty brew. But if beer is your poison of choice, they've got just about everything. The happy hour is kind of weak here though, with like a buck off all drafts. Thoroughly meh.You can peruse the coolers and grab a cold one or choose from 20+ drafts they have on the menu. No Bud Light here though. Sorry frat chumps. They used to have a ton of wine here as well (like, ages ago) but it has since been narrowed down to just four choices, none of which were calling my name this last go round. Their Orange Blossom wheat beer was a bit like drinking an orange creamsicle in beer form. Almost like a cider with floral notes, a light finish and a super creamy mouthfeel. (Oh yeah, bitches. I just went there.) The perfect beer for the novice drinker to enjoy. Their IPA was also pretty decent, but was more bitter than I care for, although it stayed far away from feeling like I was drinking a bottle of grassy perfume. Solid.I thought they had deals on happy hour food (again, like a buck off) but last time I went it was no dice. At least the food's reasonably priced. Tasty rueben, craptastic hummus, crispy quesadilla. The acoustics in this place are kind of shitty, so go on an off time when it won't be packed, or run the risk of smiling and nodding amicably while hearing every other snippet of convo. The high top tables are also really uncomfortable for shorties like me to sit at, but c'est la vie. My biggest peeve about this place is the gigando assy television against the wall. For a place this small, a big ass mofo tv is just  not the way to go.
other Shame on me for not writing a review sooner.  Dined here with three other friends during our Spring Training trip at the end of March. We had to make reservations about other months prior as well.  We arrived for our 6:30pm reservations and the place was packed! The bar was flowing, both dining areas were filled with people and the entry area was bustling. As we waited for our table, Muhammed Ali walked in with his wife and family members. That was a huge highlight. This place is rich with sports memorbillia and players often eat here after a game. Only odd thing was our waitress told us after that the Brewers Manager was also dining in the next room and that we could walk over there if wanted to. I am a super fan of baseball, but even I know the limits of someone's personal space. We each ordered a few appetizers, bottle of wine and some salads before our entrees. I ordered the 10 oz ribeye and it was delicous. We ordered a side of mac and cheese and it had lots of flavor.  This place is fun because of the sporting atmosphere, fans, players, coaches, etc. and it's walkable from Downtown Scottsdale. I'd definitely go back here again next year. For all the ladies, this place is a must visit for some great eye candy.
other If you're a fan of Postino, you have to make your way to Windsor pronto.The central Phoenix restaurant and bar is owned by Postino owner Craig DeMarco (and it's right across the street from the central Phoenix Postino), and the atmosphere and vibe are similar to Postino's. Windsor also has an open dining room that extends to the patio, the lighting is also dim, and the servers are also hip.There was a 30-minute wait for my party of two on a recent Friday night, and we sat in the indoor dining area, which overlooked the bar, which was bustling full of people and had standing room only. The restaurant is located in an historic brick building, and it has a cool wall covered completely in cassette tapes that makes it feel even hipper.For food, my pal and I started with the Cheddar Fondue ($11) off the mostly-American menu, which comes with pretzels, apples, pork, bread and sausage. The pretzels were soft and chewy, and the portion was huge. I would have preferred just the pretzels, though the apples and cheese were an interesting combination. Definitely try that appetizer if you go-it was super-tasty.For my meal, I got the Veggie Stack ($9), which was a pita topped with bean spread, quinoa, tomato, cucumber, avocado, radish,  corn and green goddess (I left the pickled beets off). I thought the toppings were interesting both taste- and texture-wise, and that part of the meal seemed relatively healthy. I paired it with some macaroni and cheese, which I enjoyed, though my pal and I weren't wowed. Maybe it's because the cheese wasn't plentiful or creamy enough, but it was still good. My pal had the Porkwich sandwich ($12). He said he liked it a lot.
other I took advantage of That's A Wrap for their catering services yesterday and once again, was totally impressed!  I called around 10am for a 5pm delivery... I wanted to make sure that those of us who were working at the Phoenix Art Museum all day preparing for the pARTy had some fuel to get us through the evening.  Sure enough, That's A Wrap delivered - literally and figuratively.  I ordered a platter of assorted sandwiches, fruit, chips, cookies, and bottled water - it was perfect!  Everything was delicious!  It arrived right on time and it was all labeled so it was easy to figure out what you were eating.  I had the "Godfather" wrap (Salami, ham, and provolone wrapped in a honey wheat tortilla with lettuce, tomato, red onion, sun- dried tomato mayo and a drizzle of olive oil).  I don't usually choose salami and ham but for whatever reason, this is the one that sounded best to me yesterday - and it was!Thanks That's A Wrap for fueling me and all of the yelper helpers for the pARTy... I'll be back to visit soon!
other Just not a great Sushi Roku location.  The service was okay and the ambience was too - but the food wasn't fabulous and the sushi chef knew very little of the food he was serving.  When sitting at the sushi bar in a 'fine dining' japanese restaurant you kind of expect the chefs to be spot on and knowlegable about the food.  Not the case here.  If you want to spend this kind of money, go to Roka Akur - it's fantastic and worth every penny.
other FOOD: I tried the T-Rex (meat lovers pizza), and it was scrumptious. The Thai Peanut Sauce Pizza was a little weird, yet still tasty in its own way, and I could only handle one slice before growing tired of peanut sauce.  The Buffalo Chicken Wing Pizza was also pretty good. The highlight of the menu was the beer. The Elsie's Irish Cream, a milk stout, was one of the best stouts I've had (better than the Left Hand Stout). It had a strong coffee flavor but in a good way (I don't drink coffee). The Orange Blossom (mandarin orange hefeweizen) was the best Hefeweizen I've ever had, and I generally don't like Hefeweizens. The orange flavor definitely made that drink more than tolerable. I tried several other beers from Papago's own brewery, and the rest seemed  good. They have dozens of bottled beers in the fridges along the walls. But I never got a chance to try any of them. PRICE: Around $other per beer on tap. Personal pizzas were $9 and large pizzas that could feed 2-3 people were $18. Appetizers were around $5. ATMOSPHERE: Pretty neat place. Funny statues, tvs, darts and all wooden furniture. Drawbacks are very small tables, uncomfortable chairs, odd layout, and almost too loud at times. SERVICE: The place seemed a little understaffed at times. We would be helped my a couple employees throughout the night as one would have to run behind the bar to make drinks or clean. All the servers were very nice and patient, but seemed to be a little overwhelmed and, thus, forgot to bring me a drink I ordered. SKINNY: Papago Brewing Company Inc has its pros and cons, but overall its a good place. I would definitely go there for the beer, while the pizza is good but nothing to rant about. Some may disagree with me, but I still prefer Tempe's own Four Peaks. I feel Four Peaks' food is better, better seating, and the beers are just as good as Papago's flavors. Don't let this comparison discourage you! Papago's is still a good place to drink and eat.
3 Drunk people go here. Service is good depending who you get. The Burger according to one Arik B can not taste his burger. When ask the server, how come my friend Arik b can't taste his burger? Why?You had to be there to laugh. What a fun night!!!!Don't order the pancakes, they are not very good. The chicken strips were a-ok.
3 Decent airport with a limited variety of food choices and a strange layout. It feels a little outdated but I was only at the airport for a quick layover.
3 I like Yogurtland, however, the lines can get long and my yogurt melts by the time I get to the cash register. It's also difficult to fill your cup with yogurt because it is pure chaos in there! Customers are running around everywhere and can't make up their mind. I also hate how I don't know how much yogurt I am getting...it ends up costing more than I bargained for and more calories. Their topping are cut into huge pieces (probably to weigh more) and the topping bar is usually messy. Again, I will stick with other yogurt places.
other Bianco is a great place to go for a reasonably priced dinner with good ambiance and solid rendition of Mexican food.  Yup, there are holes-in-the-wall tacquerias with tastier food.  But Bianco is spot-on in terms of  overall concept with good service and modern furnishing. Puts this on a repeat list.
3 Cibo is a really adorable place, but I can't say that I think it is extraordinary.  The atmosphere and ambiance is totally five star, but too much goes wrong after that to give it an overall five star.  Food stuff:  I've been twice and both times I liked it, but it wasn't love.  We got the bruscetta plate and I wasn't really thrilled.  The traditional tomato one was the most solid choice, the bean one was strange and soggy and I don't eat pig so I can't comment on the third one (though everyone else seemed to enjoy it). The pizzas are pretty decent except that they lay out the toppings in a weird way, for example, if you order the vegetarian rosa pizza, if you like zucchini, it is all chopped up on two slices and so on.  It doesn't really make sense to top a pizza in such a way, to me.  I prefer draft beer over bottled beer, and all they offer is bottled.  I did enjoy a couple glasses of the Rossi Cabernet Sauvignon which was a solid wine choice.Service:  The host/ess was a pleasant person, and the time quoted was less than we actually had to wait so that rocked.  While waiting, we attempted to get a drink.  The bartender was cool about getting our drinks in a timely manner despite the fact that it was busy.  Our actual server was super attentive at first and then lost for a good chunk of time as well.  Too hit or miss.  Cibo is an adorable spot with awesome ambiance but it isn't quite that awesome when it comes to food and service.
other Why'd the chicken cross the road?To get to Food Truck Fridays in Downtown Phoenix!I know that all you business Yelpers go out for lunch on Friday's, it's basically a rule if you sit in an office, a cubicle, or behind a desk somewhere from Monday through Friday; don't believe me, check the company hand book you were given on your first day of work. Somewhere between how to comb your hair, what you shouldn't wear, and please don't come in smelling like Nair, you'll find it. While Yelping about your Friday lunch is purely optional, I certainly hope you do ;-)During your weekly other hour exodus into the space beyond the cubicles and plaster walls, ending up in the open air of Food Truck Friday will kick off your weekend right. It's not just for Burger King people, it's time to get it your way! Pick your favorite food from, Gourmet Hot dogs with Short Leash, or Mexican with Luncha Libre, Smoothies and Salads with Mojo Bowl, to Pies with Mama Toledos, and Creme Brulee with Torched Goodness. Bring your friends and your favorite gal; they can choose their own favorite too. Don't worry about bringing cash, everyone here will swipe your plastic just as easy.This is your lunch hour, kick back and forget about work while you're here, if only for 4other minutes. Listen to the DJ's spinning popular music through their thumping sound system while you dine on your fine food. Chill out in the seating area which is cordoned off with misters, fans, and swamp coolers; bringing down the temp from a roasting 108 to a palatable upper 90's. This is your Downtown business Yelpers, it's time to kick off those business casuals, and make Friday lunch your own!
other AMC Esplanade is by far the most successful navigator of the new "Dinner and a Movie" blue ocean the theater industry is starting to penetrate (that's right, I just referenced Blue Ocean Strategy, get over it).  No, it's not an extremely enlightened idea. I've been sneaking Bacardi into theaters since 2003 so it's about time theaters realize they should probably attempt to turn a profit off of it, but AMC really upped the game by not only providing me the option of purchasing alcoholic beverages from THEM, but also upgraded chairs, and a ton of delicious food (Including the obligatory $other box of candy which is hilarious sitting next to a $9 burger. Like "Don't mind this $9 full meal over here, we still stand firm that Gummi Bears are worth their weight in gold.")Yes, it's more expensive than a regular ticket. Almost double for the nice seats. But trust me, YOU WANT THOSE SEATS. You will regret not getting the $1other seats if you don't buy the $1other seats so just pony up the cash and delight in the fact that movie theaters are now almost as comfortable as watching a movie in your own home. This theater is so nice it even makes bad movies tolerable. I saw The Master here and probably would have stabbed myself in the eye with my embezzled Bacardi flask if I didn't have a comfy recliner and three glasses of wine to get me through it. I seriously won't go to a movie anywhere else and I guarantee you'll say the same once you go. FIVE STARS.
other Tott's is this amazing little neighborhood Asian restaurant that has quickly become a favorite of mine!The simple yet effective decor is vibrant without being tacky.  The service is very friendly and helpful.  They are always smiling and it actually seems sincere!This is one of those places where you order your food from a cashier and they give you a number and you choose your seat from one of the 16 or so tables.  There is a nice little patio as well.  There are a couple of tasks you must do before they bring out your order. 1. Fill your cup with your beverege of choice (Soft drinks and Tea only- no alcohol, hence only other stars).  Do get a beverege as the food can be very hot if you like that way-AND I DO!  And because I am a fool thinking it will never be hot enough, I grab a jar of the hot mustard and one of the Hot Chili paste to bring to my table.  You can, of course, choose chopsticks or a fork.  I usually start with the good intentions and select the chopsticks.  I pretend I know exactly what I am doing.  But these never work as I cannot get enough food into my mouth quick enough so I end up with at least other fork.I am impressed how quickly they bring your order to your table.  I barely have time to do all of the above and get back to my table and they are bringing out a gorgeous plate of steaming Hot Korean with black bean sauce and tofu, or the yellow curry "panang" also with tofu.  You can aslo get chicken, beef or fish.  The meats are hand trimmed and do not have that grisle part that is such a turn off at other places.  The vegetable are as bright and fresh as the smiles on the employees' faces.I must also confess my longing for PF Chang's or Pei wei has certainly  diminished after discovering Tott's.Tott's even has excellent Won Ton soup. Now if they could only get a beer and wine license.
other Last time I went to Zinburger I was wearing a black dress, and the hostess switched out the white napkin with a black one.... real classy.
other If you want Cheap go to Walmart! But if you want authentic eclectic trinkets that you will proudly own and showcase in your home this is the place for you!
other My wife and I were looking for a particular type of rose for our garden. We called this location and asked if they had it in stock and what the price was. They said they did and quoted us a price of $24.99 for a gallon sized plant. Good to go. We drive there and find the rose bush but it is listed as $44.99. So we go to the front and say that  we had called and driven 30 minutes to get this rose and we were told "Oops...sometimes the  prices on my list up front right". No sh!t Sherlock. So...will you honor the price quoted? NO. So we drove down the street to A And P Nursery on Baseline west of Lindsay and got the same size plant that they were selling for $44.99 for $16.99. Don't waste your time with these rip-off artists.
other Culver's is a must if you have not had the chance to try them out. I believe they have several stores now here in the valley. The Root Beer is a must as well as the Butter Burgers, Cheese curds, Frys, Frozen custurd....lol ...the list goes on... I have not found anything as of yet that I did not enjoy.
other FAN-FREAKIN' -TASTIC!Yes, it's a Great steakhouse... but they also have a Great wine selection... and Great bread to start... and Great desserts.... and Great service.Rich and Richie took exceptional care of us.  They were attentive and fun to talk to... too.I had the Prime Rib and it was huge and perfectly prepared. I ended up taking the rest home and having it for lunch the next day and it was just as good the following day.  :)The Bread to start came with other different flavored butters.  You could easily fill up on bread before dinner.... so go easy on this as they will keep bringing out refills if you let them.The Dessert.... we got the Chocolate Lava Cake... and the cake part was good... but the sides that came with the cake... they were Amazing.  The Chantilly Cream they serve on the side of the cake is freshly made and it's a Little Pillow of Heaven.  Rich brought us more when we ate all the cream and still had cake left.  And then they have a little homemade pistachio cookie with vanilla ice cream on the side too... these were great too... So, net, net... I wouldn't order the Chocolate Lava Cake for the cake part.... I'd order it for the things that come WITH the cake.  :)Good for special occassions and if you are looking to have a lovely evening out.
other I was at Liberty Market this morning for breakfast. The grilled bread pudding is amazing. And the bathrooms are so adorable!
other Take someone that matters here and you won't be sorry. The service is some of the best in the world, and the food is stunning. The menu changes once or twice a year, and if you can't wrangle this place on an expense account, it is THE place to impress a client. Destined for a Michelin star....
other Southwest blows its competitors so far out of the water I actually feel bad for the other airlines.  1. Of the countless times I've flown with them, my flight has been delayed only twice and both times less than one hour.2. NO BAG FEES.  3. Nine times out of ten the lowest price.4. Killer customer service, laced with sarcasm, veiled cynicism, and high efficiency.  I love it.5. They never give me an inquisitive look when I order a cocktail on the super early morning flights.  Thank you for not judging me, SW Flight Attendants.
3 Sometimes there's a cover, and sometimes there isn't. In true nightclub fashion, you can never really tell what it's going to be either. I've never seen anything good happen downstairs. The music has never been good, regardless of the genre that night (Hip Hop, Techno, etc). And, the overall vibe is pretty lackluster.Upstairs, however, is house music heaven. Located outside under the stars, on a relatively small balcony, the vibe is always pretty stellar. Open air, video collages on the walls, and AWESOME music. I've never been let down yet. Even on a random Wednesday evening recently, when it was almost empty, the music was still amazing.If you live in the Valley, you have to visit the upstairs of Bar Smith at least once. It's fantastic. It's a shame they've never been able to replicate any of the upstairs magic to the rest of the club though.
other There is absolutely no other restaurant in town that has better BBq.  Their pull pork is just mouth watering.. Very juicy.. Great bbq sauce with a touch of spicy to it... Just perfect.. Ribs are unbelievable.. This is not a place you get a other star customer service.. if you are going here and expecting anything but great bbq, you will disappointed... It's a whole in wall and I absolutely love their food... I usually give a lot of points for customer service and treatment... but their food is so good that makes up for everything else they lack and I will keep going back just because of their good bbq....
other Addicted to duck fat fries!  Curry mayo is a perfect complement to duck fat fries.  Did I mention how awesomely delicious duck fat fries are?  You know what, forget that I said anything about duck fat fries.  They only make a limited amount and I don't want you to go.  Nope.  Don't go. I guess I should mention the rest of the menu.  Everything is awesome.  Nutella rules!  Seriously.
other This is one of my favorite places to take out of town guests.  It never fails that we laugh so hard our sides hurt!  Always fresh, always funny!  Great place for a date night or family night!  Even my teenagers love it!  I never have to worry about offending my guests because their content is family friendly.  To finish off the night, head down the street to "The Sugar Bowl" for fresh ice cream!
3 Two and a half stars, really. This place is really quite strange. Video coffee bar? I don't have much to compare it to, I guess.We'll start with the coffee: traditional espresso macchiato. No microfoam, large bubbles in the milk, too hot to drink right away. The shot was good, but by the time it was cool enough to drink had lost quite a bit of flavor.Very friendly service, on the other hand. Given that Phoenix-foam tends to be subpar, I tend to think that service and atmosphere are almost more viable measures for successful coffeeshops than coffee. (in Phoenix) The actual place was pretty odd. Large paintings of Mexican sugar skulls in the back, nice chairs and tables, an orange faux-finish on the walls... And then the video bar element. Three huge flatscreens on the wall playing pop music videos from the '90s. Very strange, in my opinion. I'm not sure that Cher and Madonna really mesh with coffee shop, but I guess they're trying something new. I had a nice time lounging and it was relatively quiet with regularly good lighting.
other I see a few of the previous reviews discussing issues with service, but I have always had good service at this place.  I have only been in a handful of times, but we never have to wait very long to be helped, and the staff is very friendly.I have only ordered salads there, but I've enjoyed the three that I've tried (Maggie's, Jamaican Jerk Chicken, and Greek).  The salad dressing always comes on the side, which is perfect, because that is how I like to order salads (so I can control the amount of dressing.)  My husband loves the pulled pork, although it's popular and sells out pretty quickly from our experience.
other This place has been my weakness since childhood. I still get food from here once a month or so. Probably the only fast food place I visit often, other than Five Guys when I lived on the east coast. If you're preparing for a trip to Mexico, just dine here once a week for a month or two before your vacation. You'll probably be introduced to much of the bacteria of delicious real-Mexican street food.Perhaps it's not that bad, but it is delicious. Especially their "pastrami dog". You can be a self-proclaimed "foodie" all you want, with your "oh, ha! ha!, but I admit that I do on the occasion dine at the selected In-N-Out" pompous asshole who thinks you're still down-to-earth, or you can come down and gorge on some real disgusting, real fast food. What are you afraid of? Your arteries will expand enough to still allow the blood  through, don't worry. Sure, they may drop your hot dog on the ground and forget to use sanitary gloves from time to time, but how else are you going to break in your immune system, you sissy?
other I have a fond place in my heart for this establishmentI've been covering my all white meat rice bowls in their sticky spicy teriyaki sauce for 10+ yearsI've lived all over the worldI always crave three things when I'm not living in Phoenix (or the USA)1.  Skim Milk2.  Mexican food3.  Tokyo ExpressNow pay attentionIf you like spicy food and teriyaki sauce, here's what you should orderAn all white spicy chicken teriyaki bowlother extra sides of spicy sauceA small saladother extra sides of salad dressingOk, so I REALLY like sauce.  Really.This place makes me want to cry I love it so much.
other This is only a Review of there men's restroom....It was like 2:30am X-mass eve...well really X-mass.....andsince I knew someone that once got busted for peeing on Scottsdale Galleria (I'm sure they weren't the first ones.)....I asked a bouncer if I could still use there restroom....and I was able too......PLUS one staroh of course there was no "attendant" at this time to stare at your ass wile you piss.....so that's a Plus....still not sure why you tip them for that....If your going to pay someone to watch you pee wouldn't you rather it be a girl? and how do you get the job to be the "Attendant" in the women's restroom? oh cool Orange "floating Sinks" Black paint every where....lots of urinals...pretty thin between them.......cool little table things......wait wheres the trash?....alright well I definitely recommend the Bathroom....I wouldn't drive out of the way for it.....But I'm certainly going back.......
other I'm not generally a fan of restaurants located within a mall, especially if it's a chain restaurant. I just don't care for the mall dining atmosphere. However, Kona Grill really surprised me! Especially the seafood. For a restaurant located in a mall... in Arizona... the seafood was awesome.There are 3 important things you need to know about Kona Grill:1. The Sea Bass is melt in your mouth, oh my god, foodgasm, amazing. Our waiter recommended it to us and I was highly skeptical. I thought that he was pushing this dish just because it's the most expensive one on the menu. Well, aside from the fact that it's the priciest item at a chain restaurant, it tastes more like a other star dish that would cost double the amount somewhere else. I'm telling you, YOU MUST TRY IT! It has this pan seared taste that is to die for. (I also can't forget to mention that the Salmon is super tasty as well).2. The Cool Cucumber Mojito is not only refreshing and delicious, but it is also less than 100 calories! It's pretty strong too. This drink is pure heaven for a mojito lover like me, and it gets extra bonus points since its low calorie!  3. Happy hour!!! It's the best and it's always packed. Kona Grill has great deals with always changing specials (I suggest checking their website before heading over).Just try at least one of these 3 things and you'll see why I'm such a fan of this place. Overall, when it comes to dining at Fashion Square Mall, Kona Grill is pretty impressive.
other Food was amazing but the service was horrible! I would suggest to take out don't dine in. I ordered the eggs Benedict, instead of Canadian bacon, they put crispy bacon on it served it with hash browns and a salad with a balsamic vinegarette. The two girl working there were so unprofessional from their interaction to the attire.
other I had other piercings done here and then went out of state and got my nose pierced with a friend and when i got back I was having problems with it. I went in and talked to them and they changed out the stud for me gave me a discount on the jewelry and were really fun, friendly, professional and very informative. This place is top notch. Won't go to another place for my piercings again! No way! It is very clean, and these guys know their stuff! Really impressed...I could go on and on! I won't get my jewelry anywhere else either...they have a a great variety and if they don't have something you want they order it, easy peasy. Love it!
other Jodi is fantastic!  Extraordinary!  After too many expensive yet less-than-average salon expereinces, my hair has been less beautiful than its potential.  Jodi gave me a very thorough consultation after I did some research to find the best colorist for me.  During my appointment, Jodi was professional, efficient and friendly.  I left the salon with soft, gorgeous hair... lovely color, care of the INOA line, and I felt beautiful again.  She did what at least half a dozen other highly recommended colorists did not accomplish.  I'm ecstatic and relieved and I have finally found my colorist.  What more can a girl ask?  Thanks so much, Jodi.
other Excellent everything! The customer service was struggling a bit but well, they just opened so hopefully that'll improve. The cookies are great. The grilled cheese was so so. Took awhile to get to us but it was slammed (but also, I was on a time limit).The manager came over and offered us free dessert for our not 100% experience. She also shared with us what soups were vegetarian and were not.I'm excited to go back. It's a great option for Downtown Phoenix!
other uuuuuugh. What a sorry disappointment of a meal. The BF and I went here for dinner tonight and it was pretty not good. I got the pick two with the balsamic steak 'panini' and the chicken stew. The BF got a turkey 'panini.' Well....his 'panini' was barely toasted, let alone a panini. My sandwich was toasted but the steak was pretty gross....chewy and tasted like it came out of a bag. The tomatoes were mealy. The whole thing was sad. The chicken stew was decent, but had that plastic -y look to it. I always find that a little disturbing. It came with a biscuit that was really gross and didn't go with the stew at all. Both of our cookies were raw in the middle. Plus the meal cost 20$. Really?! 20$?!?! Are they kidding me? I could get a countless amount of better food for that money. Not awesome. Not even good. I won't be returning.
other This is a quaint little airport which is very convenient if you are travelling to the Tempe/Mesa area, or already know people who live there.  I say it's convenient-- if you are flying in from Grand Island or Grand Forks or Rapid City or East Bugtussel, since the only commercial tenant at this decomissioned air force base is Allegiant Airlines, which specializes in flying you from nowhere to somewhere (Phoenix, Las Vegas, Orlando that sort of thing).  But from landing to sitting in my rental car it was maybe 20 minutes tops and I was heading out to lunch in the Phoenix area (don't bother with purchasing the "snacks" on the flight, just make sure you are prepared beforehand).
other Have only been here once before under too stressful of circumstances to remember, this trip to Olive and Ivy was fantastic. Usually going to lunch in Scottsdale is hit or miss with expectations, however today we had a lunch meeting scheduled for 11:30, I got a front row parking spot in front of the valet and had no problem being seated right away.Sticking to my lunch salad trend, I ordered the Curry Salad with Chicken and couldn't have asked for a more perfect dish on such a warm day. The portions were great, the lettuce cool and crisp and even the "handmade" bread and pesto before complimented everything perfectly. The only gripe I would have, understanding it is a Fox Restaurant, was how almost unnatural the wait staff was with how rehearsed and methodical all interactions were. Even down to the correct usage of "I am well" versus "I am good" seemed a bit out of place, but not a big deal.
other Let's talk about failure, baby.Hey, if your idea of salad is punishment via tasteless lettuce and mealy tomatoes splashed with the most generic, industrial vinaigrette, you've found just the right place to BDSM your tongue. Go for it!I ordered Capellini Checca, and I had it substituted with Spaghetti (I like more girth re: pasta).  What I got was the limpest pile of spaghetti that couldn't be revived with a lifetime supply of Viagra.  The DOA pasta was topped with a pathetic sprinkling of more mealy tomatoes (the menu says Fresh Roma Tomatoes- these had the texture and taste of a dying horse's ass moreso than fresh produce).  The faint, acrid garlic tasted like it came out of a shaker bottle and not a bulb- and motherf*&k, respectable Checca should have more than 1/16 teaspoon of microscopically chopped basil.  This place makes Old Spaghetti Factory look like fine dining, and I would rather starve than be even close to that chain restaurant of culinary doom.  Hell, this place is the  disowned, cracked-out junkie brother of OSF. It's really *that* terrible.I gave them the single star only because the management was incredibly lovely, and did not charge for the unforgivable disaster masquerading as edible food worth paying for.
other Solid place to grab a cup of coffee and a morning pastry.  Not sure about their lunch or happy hour but really love the layout of this place.  I tried their chorizo breakfast burrito too and it was very tasty albeit a bit pricey in my opinion.  Check this place out if you're in the area for breakfast.
other DO NOT GO HERE.  One of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had.  The setup is a little like "Pei Wei" where they take your order, give you a number, and bring the food to your table.  Placed our order, and had to stalk other tables and hover over people eating trying to wait to get a table.  Waited a long time, all the while others who ordered after us found seats and got their food before us. Servers kept bringing my food to me since it was ready, but I still didn't have a table, so they kept saying they would "put it under the heat lamp" for me.  Finally eventually found a table, and then kept waiting and waiting for our food, which the manager claimed "he had them remake" since it was getting cold.  My food came, and it was cold and disgusting.  We had to get going since we were going to a show, and my mom's food still wasn't there.  The staff asked to see her receipt, since they couldn't find her order.  She went up to the manager and said she just wanted her money back since we had to go (it had been 4other minutes since we placed our order).  He said her food would not be ready for a while, and gave her some cash, and we left.  My mom never even ate, and my food was horrible.  I would NOT recommend this place, it's awful.
other Harvest hash is incredible - ask for their house made BBQ sauce on the side. Vegan raspberry banana bread French toast!!!  Sooooo good!It's a busy place on a Saturday morning but they work fast and everything runs smoothly.A gem!!!
other Last Saturday night I got my skate on....   (Before going out to indulge in more "adult" good times) I had a fucking blast and have decided that next time I go, EVERYONE I know is going with me.  YES, that means YOU!My date picked me up around 9ish and immediately made reference to the size of my "huevos" for wearing a "red rag" into the 623. (Like anyone's going to believe a 3other yr old white girl at a skating rink is a gang banger). He was joking obviously.... called me 2Pac all night...it was cute, whatever.Upon arrival I noticed that indeed, it is pretty street in there. No biggie, I grew up in Tucson where our skate rink was filled with cholos and meth heads. I don't judge, I high five.One thing was annoying... .75cents for a locker, and only half of them worked. The .7other thing didn't bother me, the fact that they weren't marked so you just kept throwing more quarters in there and hoping for the best, did. We strapped on our skates and took off. I haven't been in many years so it took me a few minutes to get comfortable. I can proudly say that I only fell once and it wasn't my fault..... what I can not proudly say is that I ended up on top of a 13yr old boy ...and from the very loud "OWWWUCH" that came out of him I'm pretty sure I punched him in the balls. The look on his face was sheer horror. (I still can't stop laughing about it).  My date was pretty fancy on his feet..... I half expected people to profess undying love to him and call out his name as we left. (one dood kinda did)All in all, one of the most fun filled evenings that I've had in a long time. Kudos Great Skate!!
other We've eaten here a number of times and have always had the best service and great food.  All of the servers we've had were excellent and the manager always makes it a point to check on us and see if we need anything.  No complaints and we'll definitely be eating there again.
3 OH this shop makes me want to lose a hip or something just to fit into their clothing!!  I found not one thing in larger sizes, but my friend, who's a size 8, found LOTS of awesome vintage clothes...including, yes ladies and gentlemen, a 70s JUMPSUIT!  I am drooling and green with envy, but alas, I couldn't find anything.  Go here if you're thin (or just want to torture yourself by staring at all the awesome clothes that won't fit you unless you chop off some body part you probably need).
other Never had a bad meal. Just this week had the halibut ceviche special and as always the best guacamole (especially if you like garlic). The green chile stew was good, although I would have liked a bit more kick. Dined in the patio for the first time and it was great atmosphere. However it was a bit humid. Still a great experience.
other I hadn't been to Fuddruckers for about 20 years... now I know why.  Cashier was nice and very helpful.  I ordered bacon cheese burger combo.  Fries were only warm, not hot.  Burger was not very tasty and it was full of gristle bits... you know the ones that stick between your teeth.  Lots of trash on the floor.  After we were finished, someone came to ask how things were.  I told here about the fries and she offered to get me more; I declined.  She offered a free dessert: I accepted.  In all, not a good experience, will probably be at least another 20 years before I go back.
other When people feel a cold coming, they pop a zinc lozenge or tablet to boost the immune system. I have a much better way to get my zinc supplementation: I head over to Pier 83 for their terrific fried oysters. With the first crunchy bite I begin to feel so much better. Placebo effect, probably. But hey ... as long as I get that feel-good boost, I don't care. The fish and chips are also the best I've had in the Valley. And to think that I've previously been trying to get my fish 'n chips fix from the likes of Pete's ... yikes! And their clam chowder is delicious; I don't need to feel under the weather to have an excuse for ordering this tasty bowl of comfort. The friendly staff and comfortable informal atmosphere complete the enticement for many return visits.
3 Singray is pretty good. The location is nice but there is never parking due to the other businesses around. Not fun walking so far in heels. :) The sashimi was pretty fresh, but miso was a little too salty. Also they gave us cold oshibori towels when we sat at the sushi bar. I think I prefer the new Pure Sushi location next to AZ88. Once I was able to find it. Very modern cool feel and awesome food. Heard Stingray is opening another location by my house. (Biltmore area) Maybe parking will be better.
other This place shouldn't even be reviewed - because it is the kind of place I want to keep for myself...  =)
3 I usually shop at this store because it is the most convenient and has the best prices and selection in the area. For staple goods such as bread, milk, eggs, meats, and canned goods, the prices are usually lower than the other large grocery stores. Their branded goods (Kroger) such as condiments are usually good quality compared to store brands at other stores. However, in the last few years, vegetable prices have skyrocketed (other than tomatoes, celery, and lettuce) so I find myself driving several miles away to a healthy food specialty store to stock up. This Fry's was recently renovated, seemingly to make it more difficult to find the items you are looking for, and making what should be a quick trip in an out into a half-hour ordeal. The aisles also seem to be harder to navigate, with bulky displays jutting out here and there, and it's difficult to get around other customers. What I do like is that there are four self-checkouts so you usually don't have to wait in lines. I also like Fry's policy of charging you the price on the shelf-tag, or you get the item free. I've often walked out with cash in my pockets when I went in with none. Sometimes due to the confusing "VIP customer" pricing on the receipt, it's a bit difficult to tell if you paid the right price. Read your receipt carefully!
other Still quite poor both in service and food. maybe I made a mistake and ordered Sichuan Gong Bao ji ding for what seemed like people from canton district. Unfortunately to get the good service U have to speak Mandarin/Cantonese. I do speak a smattering but try not to use it as I never feel confident about the intonation. The dish came out with zichini and bell peppers (what!??)  Where is the peanuts the dried fried red peppers and the large pieces of scallion. On pointing this out all I got was " Oh you like peanuts.. ok I will put some on" and she then proceeded to get some peanuts and sprinkle it on the chicken.Well at that point I was happy that atleast the chicken pieces were present else she would probably end up sprinkling raw chicken pieces on it like the raw peanuts she dumped on top of the food. Well then  I spoke a few chinese words and the scowl turned into a smile and she then became a bit more friendlier. Unfortunately I do not condone this type of behavior. It is all in poor taste...
other My review is based on Terminal 3, Delta!  Getting checked in at Delta was quick, security line was quick, and returning picking up my bags was quick too!  The signs are easy to read and easy to understand.  I was in Nassau, Bahamas' airport, the signs pointed everywhere!  Crazy!!
other Back again.  Still thinking about the flatbread pizza w/ tandoori chicken. I told my friend not to order it as an appetizer b/c I felt it would be too much food intake.  One of the best things I've eaten in a while.  I can't wait to order that as my MAIN dish next time. Soooooo good. You gotta try it!The chutney and all the flavor combinations were perfect.  It didn't sound so special on the menu, but it is!
other I'm usually a big fan of dive bars but wasn't impressed, at all.  One of the kegs was empty so my friends didn't get their "favorite" beer, not a huge deal but not a good thing for 5pm on a Friday.  The servers seemed really overwhelmed and was probably due to the fact that there were only other for the entire place and it was really busy.On a very positive note, my friends said that the food was really good for bar food.This might be a great place for any day and time other than happy hour on a Friday.
other Given the high ratio of staff to customers, it took longer than expected to get acknowledged. However, my drink came out quickly, as did my food. The menu items all had cheesy names based on the Fox sportscasters, but that, along with the 2other TV's playing (you guessed it) sports, made it rather entertaining. The food quality was surprisingly good for an airport sports bar--burger was tasty, bacon was crispy but not burnt, and made with actual sharp cheddar cheese. Service was good too. Lorraine refilled my drink the instant it was empty, cleared the dishes and offered the check within a minute of pushing them away, and brought the receipt almost immediately. If I'd been rushing to catch a flight, I think I"d have been fine. Burger, fries, and unlimited Coke, plus tax and tip for just under $17; not too bad for an airport.Overall, it was a bit like the US Olympic swimmers I was watching while I ate--a tad slow off the blocks, but came back impressively to win the gold.
other This is the ONLY place my wife and I will buy furniture from, absolutely fantastic!My wife and I spent a better part of a month looking for a TV stand for our living room. Everything we came across was cheap and prefabricated. We stumbled on Sweet Potatoes while on our way home from another local store. The owner was extremely friendly and helpful.  We found a couple things we liked but not the size we needed.  The owner told us the pieces we were looking at are locally made and offered to call and see if they could custom make one. Not only did they agree but the price we were given was 200 dollars less than anything else we were looking at.  We have since received the piece and could not be happier!
other A classic hole in the wall mexican restaurant and a Phoenix icon. Known best for their machaca and their hot, freshly made flour tortillas. Good food at great prices.For a photo of the best chimichanga in Phoenix and a full review, check out my blog post: http://blog.phosyzzle.com/carolinas
other Drop what you're doing and drive here. After I ate here I had to go back the next day for more.  The food is that good.This cute little green building may have gone competely unoticed if I hadn't been driving down Palm Rd to avoid construction.  While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the "Grand Opening" sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy!  A new place to try!It looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor, smell and cleanliness inside.  I ordered dinner for two, to go.  The menu was awesome.  I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers, mole, mahi mahi, mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves.  It made it difficult to choose something.  Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco.  They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show.  So much flavor.  I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight.  The salsa bar is endless.  I really stocked up.  I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious.  They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus!As if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did!  I'm a sucker for Mexican folk art and Frida Kahlo is my Oprah.  There's a painting of her and Diego hanging over the salsa bar, it's amazing.  All the paintings are great, love the artist.
other I was so excited to try these cupcakes, but I've got to say I was pretty disappointed, especially after waiting in quite a long line. I am a cupcake fiend, but they were not nearly as good as I thought they would be. I got 7 different flavors and I didn't think they were very sweet and, cake wise, they all kind of tasted the same. The frosting wasn't all that great either. My mother and kids tried them too, and didn't think they were all that great. Don't get me wrong, they weren't awful, but I'd never go back. I tried them and now I'm done. I'd rather save my money (and my time) and bake my own cupcakes.
other Good steakhouse.  My steak was great and the sauces and salts you add on made it mire interesting than a usual steakhouse.  Almost all members of the party were satisfied and happy.
3 A girlfriend and I have been meaning to check Bombay Spice out for a while but have never gotten around to it until last night. (I found a great deal on LocalDines.com -use ref # 102729 if you sign up! Also, checking in with FourSquare got a us a deal! ) We ended up going a little later (8ish) so there wasnt a wait or a crowd at all which was nice because the venue is a little smaller. The bartender was very friendly, our serve was a little distracted and took a little longer to respond to our needs but she was very nice.We both had wine, the "single glass" serving is actually other glasses in case you are torn between splitting a bottle for $20 or just buying a glass for $6.  I recommend the Falling Star Cab, it was full bodied and very yummy. The other wine we tried was the Hob Nob Pinot Noir. It was great, it had a delicious combination of earthy and sweet tones to it. (I am not very good with wine lingo, but those are my unofficial terms that make sense to me.)Neither of us were very hungry but we wanted to sample the fare so we could at least see if we wanted to come back. We got to choose either a free humus or a dessert because of my deal for checking in on FourSquare (POWER NERD! I know.) I really wanted to try the mango sorbet but we opted for the chickpea hummus and roti bread. For those of you, like me, who aren't sure what roti bread is- its much lighter than pita bread and a little thinner than a tortilla. Its very tasty. The hummus was very good, and they garnished it with diced tomatoes, onions and cilantro which i loved!We also ordered the seared eggplant. It was AWESOME. It was a large slab of eggplant with a black sauce that was herby (thats a technical term in case you were wondering). They also served the egglplant with a yellow sauce drizzled on the plate which was sweet and very good, in addition to a small scoop of a red chili sauce (our waitress told me the name and I couldnt remember it for the life of me) which was spicy...I really loved this sauce it was the perfect amount of spice for the eggplant. I will be going back here to try the curry and some of the other things on the menu i cant pronounce. There are a LOT of vegetarian/vegan dishes clearly marked on the menu. Their menu also boasts that everything, except for 9 or 10 items, is completely Gluten free.Good experience, definitely looking forward to trying it again for a full meal.
other I am so sorry I didn't come here sooner! This is a great sports bar not far from our house. The service was very friendly, and the killer wings (they also have honey BBQ) were awesome. They had tons of meat on them, which isn't always the case with wings, as I am sure most of you can attest.We also had the margherita pizza, which was pretty tasty. There were numerous TVs scattered throughout the restaurant, and they had $other beers (yes $1) when we were there - fantastic deal!This place is definitely more chill than Fox Sports Grill (not quite as fancy or upscale), but it's a perfect sports watching or beer drinking venue nonetheless. Oh, and they deliver!!!!!! Good choice if you live in North Scottsdale.
other Ok so there are plenty of great reviews of this place already but I'm going to throw mine into the mix as well. The food here is fantastic, but if you've ever walked in there around lunch time you could probably figure that out from the crowd. Everytime I come in I try a new one and I'm always happy with it, I've yet to come across a pasty I didn't like here.When it comes out you might not think it's that much - but portions are deceiving because the food's pretty heavy. My main tip to you is only eat half and then pause to let it sink in - take a break to drink your beer or something. I always force myself to save the second half and it makes me much less sleepy when I head back to work after lunch :) Plus it makes great leftovers.
other Cibo! Cibo! Cibo!  I love you and your cute old farm house, your amazing pizza, affordable wine, awesome crepe desserts, and fabulous staff!I want to live in the apartment above the restaurant!! Go to Cibo for awesome food, charming atmosphere, and a great time for a girls night or on a date.  Cibo has quickly become my favorite place in Phoenix! *They're closed on Sundays...found this out the hard way.
other Went here for a work function today. What can I say, this place is awesome! A great variety of meats all cooked to perfection. My favorite was the bacon wrapped filet, yum!Nice salad bar with good variety as well, instead of bacon bits, they have a bowl full of uncrumbled bacon.Lastly a slice of cheesecake with strawberries, mmm.Simply awesome stuff! Taking the wife when I can.
3 Over-priced for the size of the facility and equipment available. The staff is friendly enough, and seeing as how its the closest 2other hour fitness place in this neighborhood, i suppose they get away with the price :)
3 We decided to meet friends here Saturday night.  Cant vouch for the drinks because I wasn't feeling well that day and decided that drinking wouldnt help things.  My wife got pretty happy with some Red Bull and vodka's, yuck, but whatever floats your boat.Wendy... well lets just say she's not going to be drinking Long Island Iced Teas for a while!  But I'm thinking they were pretty good, cuz other drinks pretty much says "i like these" or "i cant taste anything anymore".Music was good, dancing was hilarious and fun - as is always the case with K and C.  I would go back, I enjoyed the atmosphere... Um... minus a few wanna be porn stars LOL.... but hey, like I said, whatever floats your boat!  Good for a laugh at least!
other I have to admit: I am impressed.I have been to a few vegan-only-menu restaurants and I was... underwhelmed. Nothing against the raw food movement, but unless it is a raw-specific place, I expect more creativity. Show me what food can do, be, taste like. Don't just cut it up and toss it on a plate.Four of us came in to eat on a Saturday and the place was PACKED. A good sign, surely, AND it was a really great mix of demographics: young and old, many nationalities, singles, couples, families... we liked that it had a wide appeal.The place smelled fantastic, too, so we started perusing the menu long before we had a table to sit at. We waited about ten minutes for a table. It's a bit like a cafeteria in that you order and pay at the counter, and the food is brought to your table.While we waited we were given a bowl of the "house soup" which, basically, was warm carrot water with a piece of carrot or two and some tiny, tiny mushrooms. We all agreed that it needed more of a broth flavor (more types of veg? more mushrooms?), but it was tasty enough and definitely whet our appetites for more.The spring rolls were really good but needed more. As we removed the peanuts for my friend, I "blame" this on us... I will have to have them with the peanuts next time.The crispy rolls were spiced and savory and light and perfectly crispy. My favorite had to be the Pate Chaude. Flaky, savory with a bite from a wonderful combination of spices, and a meatiness from the mushrooms that made us think a die-hard carnivore in our lives may not miss the meat if he were to eat it. THE dish of the day, hands down.The curries were a bit bland (Save-Planet and Divine Curry Noodles). They were fine, OK, but nothing that made us think we'd come just for that. Much better elsewhere.The Gracious Spicy Noodle soup was really tasty but it needed a tad more spice. With spicy in the name, we expected more. Some stuff is pretty basic: the sushi rolls are basic veggie sushi rolls. The rainbow salad is a tasty but commonplace cabbage and carrot slaw. The fried rice was fried rice. All yummy, all fine to eat, but nothing spectacular, different, or altogether exciting. Basic isn't bad.Four stars for the surprising and amazing pate chaude and the rolls, for sure. Ideally, 3.other stars this trip, but I rounded up for the good parts. Couldn't go five stars for two reasons: too many items were just basic and the service is slooooooooow. 20+ minutes for fried rice (that we had to ask about)? 25+ minutes for some soup? It was a crap shoot as to what was going to be delivered and when. While they were swamped when we came in, the crowd was thinning out for their afternoon down time (they close from 3p-5p). Overall, our lunch took over other hours, most of it waiting on dishes to come out. No bueno if you have other plans that day.So... tasty, some major standouts, some "meh, I've had this before." We *WILL* absolutely go back to give the menu more of a chance to wow us; the ones that knocked us off our feet are worth the return. (Hopefully it's delivered a little faster this time!).
3 Great to see a Total Wine closer to where I live.  Large selection and decent prices. Used the $10 off coupon from the newspaper to buy a nice Napa Cab this afternoon.
3 Angela, the Nurse practitioner, was great.  baby had a gooky eye and we took her to this urgent care office to see if it was Pinkeye so it could be treated early on.  It was Friday and her regular Dr. was booked up.  Angela said there was no Pinkeye but she had pus in her ears and had a minor ear infection so she prescribed antibiotics, amoxicilon I think.  The only hitch was when the baby had her regular dr appointment the next week he said there was no infection so we were left to wonder who was right.
other Thanks for the positive reinforcement talk, and explaining, I just need to take my time. Thanks Robin, you encourage me,I have been sick, and so has my family. I have missed the last couple of weeks and boy can I feel the difference. You know when miss something for a period of time?? Then you have to start all over, but that o.k.Thank you again Jim and Robin for taking those few extra minutes to ask me how I am doing and how my kids are since I have been gone. Thanks so much for caring, weather its about my kids or my knees or the fact that I have a pain pump in my stomach and   have a hard time laying on my stomach, which Robin saw I was not putting full weight down on my stomach. She asked me after class what was going on and if I was O.K. She made me feel important and cared about. Where are you ever going to be working out and after class the teacher checks in with you, to make sure everything is alright. Jim and Robin Love this practice and so do I. I feel what makes them different is the caring aspect. The checking in with you. If you ever have a question, Jim and Robin will ALWAYS take the time answer questions or just see how you are doing!!! Thanks Jim and Robin! I will be back soon!!!! Thank you for being the best Bikram yoga around and thanks for just being non-judgmental, caring, and hopeful for everyone in the class to push harder and just do it the RIGHT way!!!! Love your studio, Love Robin and Jim as people!!!!!!! This is the perfect place to either start or to be challenged.Thanks, Nicole Skarderud
other My son comes here for the tacos but I am all about the chile relleno.  I never had one with potatoes inside, but oh my, this was the best!  My only recommendation would be to order it dry, with the sauce on the side.  I am counting the days until I get back to AZ.  The new location is so much closer to us, I plan on trying all of their menu, but....but... that chile relleno is ....calling....me.......! The tacos were very very good though.
other Totally worth the drive from Scottsdale. The food is delicious, and is not pre-packaged, such a nice change for a coffee joint. Support local business, Starbucks has nothing on Lux; other than a million locations.
other I really hate to do this.  This restaurant is fit for those that think Taco Bell is a great place for Mexican food.The buffet was pathetic and contained maybe 1other items (no white rice).  My sampling of their offerings ranged from terrible to mediocre.  China Garden has, hands down, the worst eggroll I've eaten.Given the atmosphere of the place it was plain to see China Garden had regulars.  One guy at the cashier even commented that he'd been coming since 1970.  I don't get it.  This is the worst restaurant I have ever dined at.The staff and whom I presumed to be the owner/manager was nice and friendly but that cannot make up for the poor quality of selection and food.
other The mozzarella tomato and basil sandwich is the BEST sandwich in Phoenix, hands down. If you haven't been to Pane Bianco you are truly missing out.
3 Dear Arizona Cardinals, Can you please get your crap together and win some games (similar to last night) so Phoenicians will like you and you can finally build a fan base?  While I half-enjoyed watching you spank the St. Louis Rams yesterday in the last game of the season, while scoring the most points in a Cardinals game since the 1970s, you still suffer from mediocrity.  Your win against the lowly Rams was hardly inspiring since that team completely sucks. AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, can you please beat the piece-of-crap 49ers?!?!You remind me of a nouveau riche socialite with no manners.  You have a beautiful expensive abode, but still seem like you're from the wrong side of the tracks.  Please tell your owners to stop being so cheap, beef up your roster, spend a little dough and take some risks and the ever-elusive glory years might be around the corner.Last night, a jaded and cynical fan of yours told my friends (in Rams jerseys) in the parking lot, "Thanks for sucking today.  WE usually suck and all, but your team was much worse."Funny and defeatist attitude, but what do you expect?  I'll be here waiting, cheering and hoping.  There's always next season. Five stars for trying.One star for the crappy ownership.
other I love their turkey and provolone cold sub! Delicious with pickles added.
other You can get drunk and get your nails painted.  Huh?It's true, and it happens on Mondays.  For $10, you choose any martini you want.  Then, you drink and chat until it's your turn to get your hands worked on.The chocolate martini I ordered was strong and smooth.  Definitely not watered down...just what the doctor ordered.  Okay, so the manicure wasn't something you might get at a spa, but it was a fun little silly girly thing, that I personally think is a great idea.  Still, for the price of just the martini alone, you get shiney new nails.  Not a bad deal.The people watching is quite interesting as well, I even struck up a conversation with a humorous dad of a popular comedian.Bring the girls and have some fun.
other Went here earlier this spring and WOW - What a way to watch spring training I LOVE the Giants stadium, and this is much better. It has twice as much lawn seating, the seats are wide and comfortable AND - aimed towards home plate, which didn't used to seem like a big deal but sitting in Scottsdale down the line, IT IS. The food there is top notch, with an amazing pizza slice Plus, the ability to walk around to diff fields and watch other players work out is amazing - it sucks that the Giants keep fields separate, I think every team should do such a joint complex.
other Had the Jalapeno burger.  Great stuff.If you have not eaten here yet, I highly recommend it.I've Had their Tri Tip, Beef & Pork Ribs, Pork, Brisket & Burgers along with most of their sides.  All were excellent.Their Drink specials were great as well.
other Coming from a place and age where the most exotic ethnic food was considered to be Taco Time, I have spent  many years experimenting with all kinds of different foods.  One of my favorites is Indian food, and thanks to Microsoft and other tech companies, who use workers from India,  there are many more Indian restaurants now scattered throughout the country.  I am not an expert on the food (in fact, until recently, I never understood why Bollywood movies were always playing in Indian restaurants).  But I do enjoy it, and try every Indian restaurant I can find.I started going to Indian Paradise several years ago, and loved it.  It has a nice interior, and the servers are very nice and helpful.  I always seem to come in the early evening, before they are busy, and I always feel somewhat spoiled the way they treat me.  I love their masalas, curry, and naan, and have, of course, tried all of their Indian beers. I also find the different tandoori dishes delicious.I might note that I have never made it to the lunch buffet - I always seem to be golfing at that time so I'm just never in the area .  But it is on my list of things to do.***Bollywood - Bollywood is the name given to the Mumbai-based Hindi-language film industry in India.The term Bollywood was created by conflating Bombay (the city now called Mumbai) and Hollywood. Bollywood films are usually musicals. Few movies are made without at least one song-and-dance number. Indian audiences expect full value for their money; they want songs and dances, love interest, comedy and dare-devil thrills, all mixed up in a three hour long extravaganza with intermission.
other The name says it all. This is one hot bagel shop! This could be one of the best bagel shops I've found in Phoenix and I would have never expected to find it way up in North Scottsdale. This bagel shop is delicious. The bagels are large, hot, soft and extremely delicious. This local eatery has a line out the door on weekends and it's for a reason. The breakfast bagel sandwiches are to-die-for. The cheese, egg and bacon combo sandwiched between a hefty bagel makes it worth waking up early on a Sunday morning! I will be visiting again soon for the deli because I hear that it's a must to stop by and experience their lunch.
other I love this place! People are very friendly and very clean restaurant. I come here with co workers for lunch on a weekly basis. I order a gyro pita and side of Greek fries, so delicious! The salads are huge and tasty as well. The Greek fries are amazing with feta cheese and a lemon butter sauce they put over the fries. I can eat here everyday!
other Had lunch here today with Lynn W. and Rand H. Well the the place is new and the decor is well done and comfy . They have enough food selections to classify them as a super buffet. As far as the food goes it was all pretty good with most of your typical Chinese buffet selections . Some of the extra items were steamed clams , double baked potatoes ,fresh strawberries and Vienna sausage. The macaroni salad I had was very good and i went back for more as was the stuffed shrimp. There is also a sushi bar but I did not try any on this trip. The food here makes them a other star eatery and as far as the staff goes they need to be a lot more happier with a name like happy buffet.
other I tried Pork on a Fork at the ASU Tempe farmers market. Beef brisket and pulled pork sandwiches were sold there in a small tent.My sandwich (brisket) was very tasty, albeit a little plain (just meat and bread). There were three great BBQ sauces available - sweet/mild, tart, and spicy. I used a lot of all three, but spicy was the best. I felt like I could drink those sauces!At $6-8, the sandwiches are a little pricey, but they are filling and taste excellent. It would be nice if they came with some corn, beans, or the like to round out the meal.
other Holy crap is this place good.  With the gazillion milkshake flavors to choose from, I had vanilla....... kinda anti-climatic I know. Next time though.  The burgers were huge with 20 some odd topings to choose from. I had onions and pickles...... I know, another let down. Next time I sware.  Also the onion rings are tops here. Fries looked good too.The decore is a nice 50's diner type with very friendly staff.  Outdoor seating is nice when it's not hot out and it's very close to the theatre which makes it the perfect stop before seeing Mama Mia........ J/K on that one. Saw Batman.
other Will never eat here again. Sandwich was meteocre and overpriced. On top Of that I was charged more than I was told the total was. Horrible first time experience!
3 I visited Carly's for a weekday lunch when I was downtown for work. Here is the rundown:1) parking is horrid - common downtown, so take the lightrail (the stop is on Central and Roosevelt) or bring a fist full of quarters for the meter2) it is crowded! well it was when I was there3) the service was pretty good considering how swamped it was and I told the nice server I was in a hurry and she was able to take my order from soup to nuts in maybe 10 minutes even though their credit card machine was down4) I ordered a gyro and their orzo pasta salad, the gyro was mediocre and bland but the pasta was wonderfulI will definitely try Carly's again when I am not rushed, the interior is hipster, funky, low key and the staff was very friendly.
other Jeremiah is great! He is very friendly, patient, and knows what he's doing! We started off with the Drunken Cheesy Bread, it's ok. Not something I would want again. Nothing wrong with it, just not my taste. For lunch, I had the Chicken Parmesan sandwich, along with a house salad. The sandwich is great. Loved it. The house salad... I mean, I could not stop eating it. I have no idea which kind of dressing was on it, but it was AMAZING. I am craving it just thinking about it. The interior is very clean, roomy, very casual. I heard they have great happy hour, so I will be back again.
other WOW!  Great donuts!  Honestly you can't eat just one!  I loved the plain glazed and the old-fashioned!  Not like the franchise donut shops, these have the real bakery taste!
other For our first time we had a great time! Our server was very knowledgable about the menu especially the drink menu. Culinary Dropout has to have some off the most creative drinks I've seen in a while. Everyone mentioned the pretzels on Yelp and they were right! The cheese sauce was velvety and delicious and the pretzel bites had the perfect texture. My girlfriend and I both couldn't finish our sandwiches because they are pretty big. I will definitely be going back to try the charcuterie menu.
other The management thanked me profusely for my input on Yelp and graciously invited me to return as a guest to show me the true Latilla Experience. I was told changes have been made because of reading my YELP review.The changes are that dinner portions are more ample than before, the appetizer plate share charge is gone now and I noticed the web site has been updated. This visit showed little resemblance to the service I had last time. A full staff was on with staff working in sync as a team with all the tables not just mine.I was even more blown away with the food than the last time due to perhaps I picked foods that were more suiting to me some highs were-Beet salad- it was similar to others I had in other places but this one also had HOUSE GROWN BEETS ,Riesling soaked pears and the toasted hazelnuts made the salad  pop with flavor. Foraged mushroom rissotto-correctally made with a depth of flavor, it was good on it's own but this had an added embellishment of a SIXTY TWO DEGREE duck egg. Nicely seasoned and prepared fresh branzino sat on top of ribbon cut caponata, an unusual surprise was the vinaigrette and the ribbon cut string less celery that was very good. We also enjoyed the Kobe Flap steak with wine reduction and tiny marble size multi color potatoes and tasty spinach.Since we skipped the interesting desserts last time we had to try one this time and tried the chocolate hazelnut cake with jam-figs and mascarpone gelato this dessert was garnished with a chocolate sort of lavender crisp and roasted hazelnuts. This dessert was something Iron chef worthy for sure with all the flavors working well together.The service we had was phenomenal.The food at Latilla is masterfully done, the surroundings are majestic and breathtaking. The meal we had wasn't ordinary it was extraordinary!
3 The employees here are really nice and I like the island feel. The food is pretty good and I like it because there aren't many other places in town with Hawaiian food. I also like that you can get beer here.
other I enjoyed this place. It was a nice change of pace. I'm really not into spicy food, but the food wasn't really spicy, although it had a nice kick to it. The place was a little small for my taste, but the food made up for it. The staff is very friendly and the prices were reasonable, compared to the huge servings of food. I went with a group. I had a blood orange mojito, and we shared some of their chicken, cornbread, creamed corn, steak, prawns, and the chipotle mashed potatoes.
other I actually really liked this place. The yelp reviews seemed kind of mixed, so I went to check it out myself for Happy hour. First of all, they have Oak Creek Hefeweizen there, which is one of my favorite beers. Its kind of hard to find here in the valley, for me at least! Anyway, the beers on tap for HH were $3!! Thats a great deal in itself. We were with a group so we tried quite a bit of the food off the menu. Let me first just say the two best things are the Mac and Cheese (phenomenal and addicting), and the Buffalo Sloppy Joe sliders. The pork sliders were also good as well as the sweet potato fries. The fries came with this yogurt/tzatziki type dipping sauce which was really great too. After about 9 beers, and a bunch of food, the total bill was only $54! Parking downtown is hard to come by, another plus about this place is that, because it is at the Sheraton downton, you can valet your car for free for 3 hours and just get it validated by the restaurant. I just gave them a few bucks for a tip. The service is also pretty great here, the servers are attentive. It could also be because there weren't many people there. Oh well, I wasn't there for the crowd as much as I was the food/drinks.If you are looking for a great value for HH, this is the place to go. Parking is not hard, prices are great, and food is awesome!
3 Finally a place to watch local sports with sound.  I always find it unbelievable that many sports bars here in town look past our local teams and support the foreign hoards from Wisconsin, Minnesota, NY, Illinois etc..  Not at Dukes...local first.Please return to your frozen tundras and leave us with the Suns, Cardinals, Devils and Coyotes.The food here is nice bar/pub fare and is always fresh and hot.  Drinks are plentiful and service respectable.  Would like to see a little more variety on the taps but other than that Dukes is a great place to catch a game.
other So we decided to come back and give this place another  try and it was  a lot better than our first experience!  We had the fondue first, which was more than enough for other people to share.  I had the chicago dog, again and my bf had a hamburger.  The service was awesome and our waitress made sure we had more than enough wine!  Looks like Windsor has been ironing out their kinks and really making it into a cool, fun space to hang out and eat!
other Los Olivos is a quiet resturaunt in the Old Scottsdale city near the SF Giants spring training site. That is how I happened on this wonderful family style eatery. Arrived to the area to meet a Good HS friend and was way early. Used the Yelp app on my phone and soon I was here! Seated with out any wait. The place was just picking up since the ball game was not to far off and it was Dinner time as well. Service was very efficient and pleasant. I'm partial to Chicken what ever in these Mexican style resturaunts, and had a 'Chimi'. Arrived shortly and enjoyed it emencely.I would recomend Los Olivos to anyone. Looks as if they can handle most any size group as well! Everything is reasonably priced as well. Enjoy! Holla!
other Closed on Sunday?  Looks like you've not only lost my Sunday dollars, but my business on Monday through Saturday too.
other Avoid this einstein's at all cost. I have been laying in bed puking for over 1other hours because I ate at this garbage dump. The reason I know it was them? My girl is laying next to me puking as well. And the only place we both ate together less than 2other hours ago was there.The incompetent staff that happens to grace this poorly operating business cannot tell the difference between a large drink and a medium and take over 10 minutes to make two identical sandwiches.After we got home and ate them, fast forward 6 hours and we are both puking our brains out.The most common reason for this to happen is when an employee does not wash their hands after getting feces on them. Then they touch my food and I get sick. Based on the staff that day, it does not surprise me one bit.I would recommend starving over going here. Never again. Now I will go speak to Ralph on the big white telephone some more.
other Always my favorite coffee shop.Too bad the baristas remember my fiancé but not me, even though we always come in together. Pfft.But that's okay. I can take solace in their georgia peach tea and gluten-free/vegan english muffin. Toasted with just the right preserves, it makes my belly happy. I cheated on my diet but that's okay. Just don't tell my doctor.I have always been a fan of their food. I did knock this down to other stars because they seem to have dumped a lot of the vegan/gluten-free options they used to have. Super sad face.Also, there was a very loud man in there asking for money, yesterday. But he quickly left. Loud conversation is very distracting. It is not the quietest coffee shop if there are many people, but it is still nice!
other This is by far the best Chicken Fried Steak around!  Not to mention their mashed potatoe's, salad and biscuit!  I've never been able to clean my plate here, which is great since I always have an extra meal!   Of course you can always get the lunch portion which is smaller, but then you don't have the extra goodies for later!  It's a small down home place, dress comfy and go there to eat up!  The wait staff is always the best and they know their stuff!  I've had their T-Bone here, and it's good, but really hard to go there and not get what made them famous!  Wonderful food!Prices for lunch are around $7.00 and dinner around $12.00 - really hard to beat for real down home cooking!
other super great neighborhood bookstore. it's local and not owned by the man. jimmy carter will be there signing books in febuary.  They have new and used book and something is always on sale. It's attached to wild flower and next to macs.
3 I wasn't sure what to expect. This was stop other on the pub crawl.  There was an emo looking couple in a booth a table full of patrons (they looked like regulars)The artwork on the walls was dark and ecclectic, but the place didn't have a dark feel.I can't say this would be "my" bar. But if I were in the neighborhood I would go to this bar for a few drinks and some hummus.
other Four Peaks serves up some great beers and great eats.  This is no secret so no matter which day out of the year or which hour and minute out of the day you go you will see a full patio, and a populated bar.  Plan accordingly.  Try their Italian beer bread, the Carne Adovada, or the Southwest burger and wash it down with a pint of Hop Knot or Kilt Lifter.  You will be happy you did.  All of Four Peaks' menu items are appropriately priced and you will always leave satisfied.
other Melrose Pharmacy is my go-to pharmacy.  Not only is it in my neighborhood, it is independently owned and operated by Teresa Stickler.  Her and her husband Kurt are people who care about the community.  The fact that they provide a level of service that their chain store competitors can only dream of is a is the icing on the cake.  They are also lightening quick, dispensing most prescriptions while you wait.Moreover, they are a FULL  service pharmacy, they also offer delivery (handy when you feel like you are on the verge of death) and useful recommendations on the pros and cons on a on non-prescription drugs and vitamins (often recommending the lower priced generic brand).  In addition, you can find a wide variety of homeopathic products, as well as a selection of snacks, books and small gifts.Even if you don't need to get a prescription filled, it's worth a visit to check out the retro interior and grab and grab a vintage bottled pop and candy.  Better yet, stop by on a First Friday when the pharmacy features live music, and frequent art shows in the studio in the same complex.
other Still not much hair to cut but Helen does a good job and has developed a following of both men and women.  Don't spread the word or I will have to wait longer.
other OMG! I am so frustrated at this store, I have never met such an incompetent group of people in my entire shopping life. First, I called Fry's Electronics to check to see if they had a specific GPS model that worked in Europe. I called because I live at 115th Ave and Buckeye which is about 20miles from the nearest store. The call center informed me they did not carry that model but listed about 10 other GPS with maps of Europe. I asked again those models have maps of Europe? "Yes and Australia too". And you have those models in stock? "Yes." What is the price range? "$100 to $300". Thank you. FIRST MISINFORMATION! So I drove to  30th Ave and Thunderbird, talked with "GPS Specialist" (which apparently means nothing) and he (Jared) informed me they did not have any GPS units with European maps!! He said the call center "is a bunch of retards" and that those were all last years models. Then he called someone and looked at several GPS Units. When he did not know  if the unit had European maps or not he GOOGLED them! (okay not confident in your product knowledge). Then he sold me a $260 unit with European maps. SECOND MISINFORMATION. I drove all the way home and the GPS did not have European maps! I had to buy them for another $100 which I could have done with a cheaper GPS.So I drive back to Fry's. Speak with a Supervisor, they return my first GPS. I speak with the same sales rep (ya thats great). He says he figured out 25min after I left that he sold me the wrong product and none of their GPS have european maps. So I then buy the cheapest model that was could download European maps, according the the sales rep Garmin NUVI 50Lm for $129.  THIRD MISINFORMATION. Because according to the Garmin site the NUVI 40Lm is also compatible and cheaper. I then went home bought the $100 European map and couldn't download it to my GPS because there wasn't enough space available!!!Now I have to buy a miniSD Card and a miniSD reader for my Mac book. Awesome. Great to know that the electronic store knows nothing about electronics!
3 Update:  Unfortunately... the last two times we've come back, the food was just ok.  Definitely not $140.00 great.   We even went for their three plate combo for $40.00 / person, and the cupcake it came with, I only took other bite.  I didn't even see the chocolate explosion on the menu... very disappointing.  It would be good, if it was cheaper - but at $140.00, you really want to be wowed...  and that hasn't happened.
other This is my parent's favorite froyo place, and with a pretty convenient location, we tend to automatically go to Kokomo when we want frozen yogurt. The atmosphere is fun, with a modern vibe and the frozen yogurt is pretty good. While I usually have to taste all the flavors they have (gotta weigh my options!), I tend to only find a few that are above average and worth making it into my cup. They also have the typical toppings you'd expect. Prices are consistent with other local frozen yogurt places.
other Once again, family was out to try something new! I was in the mood for pizza. I noticed there were quite a few pizza joint in this area! So this was the first one we tried. We order a pepperoni and green peppers pizza well done, spaghetti and meatballs, and chicken Parmesan. The pizza was good, I enjoyed the flavors, pepperoni, cheese, and sauce was very good. I am not sold on the crust! But overall the pizza was still good. The spaghetti was very good, especially the meatballs! It takes a lot for me to like meatballs and these were one of the best I have tasted. Daughter hardly gave me a chance to taste the chicken Parisian, but what I did taste was really good, they do like to pile on the cheese, that's the way to get my daughters heart! Over all we had a great time, we love the small mom and pops atmosphere, and we will probably come back soon!
other Half of Bottles of Wine!  Open 7A to  12A 7 Days a Week.My Florist displays one of the Valley's largest sings and salad menus. The story of name comes from an old flower shop and the current owners of My Florist continued to use the sign and name.The  fresh products, from the bread to the veggies and fruits equals four stars to me.  The service is friendly and the servers know their stuff but I have never been blown away by the service operations.   Dessert,Amazing, This is a place that I will drive to just to have a dessert and perhaps some wine to go along with it.  The place takes reservations late so don't be afraid to stop in late.   LIve music Tuesday - Sunday.  Nicole Pesce plays the piano W-S  ((Please Send me a message if you know of any other restaurants with live music))The relaxed atmosphere is created by a very open dinning area.  And don't forget to go next door during the day to visit Willio Grocery. I'm amazed how different the reviews are for the restaurant.  Please see for your self and see why so many people yelp (good or bad) about the place.
3 As I write this, I'm waiting for the toilet in the room above me to stop refilling, and the man to the upper left of me to stop his muffled, out of key singing.That puts me in a weird head space, review wise. While this hotel is only three years old, it sounds like it may as well have been built in the 70's. I hear all the conversations of the folks in the hallway, I hear people walking down the hallway above mine, and for the past two days, the heavy footsteps of the person above me woke me up well before my alarm. Normally I'm pretty lenient about things like that but, c'mon. This is a roadside haven meant for business travelers (and tourists too stupid to see that this hotel is near NOTHING you're trying to visit Arizona for) to get some damned shut eye. It's a little tough under the current conditions.Aside from, you know, sleeping. The rest of this Courtyard is pretty nice. The interior and amenities vastly make up for the absolute desolation outside. It's located off 91st, just north of the 10 freeway. There's a little patch of desert and an ITT Technical Institute across the parking lot that seems too small to handle the amount of folks who need to park.Anyway, back to the inside. This is a newer Courtyard. Marriott is drastically trying to get its old chains into a modernization fit to compete with Hilton and Hyatt's business lines. This renovation, (or new construction in this case) includes adding a "restaurant" for breakfast and dinner. And a bar across the way open from 5pm-10pm. Thank God for these two additions because the pickin's around the hotel are slim as a Calvin Klein model. I think there's a Chipotle around the corner. I didn't see you jump for joy. What, not impressed?The rooms are the modern Courtyard style with LG flat screens, fancy shampoos, interesting art on the walls, wired and wireless internet...etc. This location has low tile showers with glass doors. Fancy. I'm used to the sliding curtain that ends up soaking the floor because it's all cloth anyway.If they could get the sound issues fixed (lucky me, I'm on the side of the hotel NOT facing the freeway) I'd easily give another star. Proximity to anything worthwhile is pretty bad, but the point of this hotel appears to be for housing workers in the local warehouses nearby. There's plenty of regulars here week after week after week as the bartender told me a few nights ago.One definite draw is that their weight room is pretty top notch and, of course, dead. You can easily be the only one in there night after night while folks who really need to use a gym will walk by you with minds set on beers, staring into the window as if to ask why anyone would try to work off the food they eat. Hmmm... I wonder. The interior of this Courtyard vastly makes up for the desolation
other This place has negra modelo on tap.  I would almost give them other stars alone for that.  The food here is incredible, very reasonably priced, and is mostly locally grown and raised.  Add in there musical taste, a mixture of latin and indie rock, and you have a place about to explode from too much hipster cred.  I mean that in a good way.  We live in the east valley, so this is a haul for us, but this is THE place we take our out of town guests.  Everyone loves it.
other Theatre is very nice. Seats are not as comfortable as you would think. They have like office chairs in every other row. Also the food is not good, and it's so overpriced. Did you know it costs a dollar to put onions on your burger? Want cheese? That's another dollar. And it's not even good. Screen is beautiful and a clean picture though.. 3D was great.
other Fantastic.  Absolutely fantastic.  I recommend OHSO for anyone looking to dine at a neighborhood bar and grill. I was really shocked when I dined at OHSO for a Sunday brunch.  I figured the variety of beers would be the focal point of the brewery; boy, was I wrong.  This place has some of the best dishes in Scottsdale supported by a huge selection of beer.  Let me say this with more clarity: great food differentiates this place, not the huge variety of beers.  This is a great achievement considering many breweries focus on providing rare beers with mediocre food.  The "Burger + Cheese" is simply awesome.  A GREAT brunch dish is the "Breakfast Burrito" as well as the "Breakfast Flatbread."
other I am a steak lover but I must say this wouldn't be somewhere i would recommend. Our steaks were cooked wrong, had a pretty blah taste and we sat in the restaurant for 20 min before anyone asked us about drinks. The drinks were $9 and were supposed to be "top shelf" uh I thinks not. tasted very watered down and I decided to limit myself to one at that price to quality ratio. The only part of the experience that was worth while the observing the table sitting next to us. Listening to them bicker back and fourth and argue about what they were going to get was quite entertaining....... I would not recommend going there for anyone there is plenty of other options close by that will leave you satisfied
other This place is everything a sports bar should be. Lots and lots of TV's...for one. I love being able to watch other different sports and play trivia all at the same time.The drink specials are pretty decent. They're not a dollar or anything, but the big beers are cheap on happy hour.The food is great! So far I've only tried the spinach dip, wings and their all-you-can-eat fish & chips. All of them were seriously delicious! These types of food are pretty standard in sports bars but I've definitely had my fair share of unfortunate food items from other places. These certainly surpassed my expectations.And last but not least, their star of the show, Debbie. One of the best bartenders I've ever seen. She runs that bar like a champ, knows nearly every face that walks through that door, and pours great drinks. And by great, I mean a good stiff drink that's not so strong that you can't taste anything else in it.We frequent this place quite often, and for good reason. Do yourself a favor and stop in!
other We've been going here for 2other years and I had my first BAD meal recently. A rotten chicken tamale, the corn meal might have had rancid fat in it or the chicken was rotten, either way it was stinky. The wait staff didn't seem outraged and shrugged it off as though this has happened before.  I may go back here in another year, but Rosita's Place is off limits for me now.
other This Chipotle Rocks!  Today, I express my joyIn the haiku form!Perfect fast food joint;Fresh, delicious, quick and kind.The price is right, too!Burritos galore;In a tortilla or bowl.But wait, there is more!Three steak tacos, please!Or grilled veggie fajitas?Oh sweet perfection.A simple menu,Yet so many decisions.How can you go wrong?Answer:  You cannot!  Order now, you won't regret,This Chipotle Rocks!
other Great service every time. Food is excellent. Levi is the best server.Great place for a few glasses of wine, fun atmosphere & delicious food. The ice cream is amazing!
other Updating my review after several weeks. Appears maybe the managers read these reviews. In the last few weeks this store has improved other stars. The eggs in my BBs have been cooked perfectly, Diet Coke tastes better and they have not forgotten anything in all my visits. Added two stars because they have been consistently other stars since my last review...but I am still watching.
3 This Pei Wei is consistant with it's orders being correct & clean. My one wish is that the parking lot it shares with Starbucks & Sidebar were about 1other cars larger. I don't see that happening but a girl can wish can't she?
other The decor and ambience was very pleasant.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.   Granted, it was a Monday night and my wife and I were only one of three parties in the restaurant.   We ordered the hot and sour soup, the puu puu platter (sp?), chicken chow mein, and the curry chicken.  Everything was terrific.  The hot and sour soup surprised me - I'm not normally a very big soup fan but I thoroughly enjoyed it both at the restaurant and as left-overs the next day.     The portions of all of the orders were very big.  We had left-overs for three additional meals.
other An Ode to Walmart: It's WalmartA senior citizen handing out carts at the door.  My cart doesn't roll straight.  I'm not surprised.  There are no baskets, just carts.  Is that a hint?It's Walmart.More babies than a daycare.  More seniors than a senior center.  And tattoos for everyone.It's Walmart.Cardboard kingdoms of snacks, a tower of cheese balls bigger than you head for $5.98 each, a wall of ramen labeled "Cup-O-Soup," and a kid putting cheese balls bigger than your head into his family's cart.It's Walmart.Fifty cent clearance plastic margarita glasses.  A crate of $other DVDs bigger than my bathtub.  The PA announces "All loaders, code 60.  All loaders, code 60."It's Walmart.A pharmacy, vision center, credit union, grocery store, hair dresser, automotive section, toy store, bike shop, Home Depot, and Office Depot all under one roof.  I think I got lost twice.It's Walmart.Profits measured one penny at a time.  Is Walmart a savior for the poor or does Walmart enable poverty?  Economist can't decide.  Does Walmart help the environment by working with vendors to reduce and remove packaging, and engaging in some environmental friendly projects.  Environmentalists have decided.It's Walmart.Self-checkout with a weight sensor to keep you honest.  They've never checked my receipt at the exit.  Is it because I'm white?It's Walmart.Patrons leave their carts at the bus stop.  Where did that hour of my life go?
other I've only been here once, for breakfast, but I was very impressed and hope to make it back again soon!
other Superb service and food. Better than average wine list. Steaks and seafood were cooked expertly, sides were just right. Seafood tower was put together appropriately for our 6 person group. I gave 4, not other 1/other or 5, stars because it was just tood darned dark and noisy. But still an excellent experience. Pricey as expected, but not overpriced.
other I did not expect such a great find in a such a nondescript location. I went there looking for a very odd beer. Not only did they have it, they had tons of it. The guy behind the counter was helpful as soon as I walked in, and showed me exactly what I needed.They know what they sell very well, and can give excellent recommendations on whatever you might be looking for. It was great to talk shop with someone who obviously knew his stuff.
other I am from NYC and have been in Phoenix for a few months! This Native NY'er is within walking distance from my hotel. I've been going their for about two months on Friday and Saturday nights for food, drinks and the karaoke. The food was OK, the drinks specials were good and the service was also good. The problem is that when a confrontation erupted at the bar the staff did not respond quilckly to notify the police. So, I ended up geting injured and when I asked them to call the police the did not, I had to. And after the episode they said they hoped It would not affect me not coming back again! Not even a comp or something! Just an I'm sorry what happened! I will not be returning at all. I looked over my nine charges on my statements and seen I had spent over $300 their. There loss!
other Every time going to this Best Buy I've had a good experience. The staff is extremely helpful, but not overbearing (constantly asking and asking to help like other Best Buys). They ask once, then give you your space. When you have a question, they're always nice and prompt to answer. Perfect customer service.It gets better though. The most recent visit to this location I had bought a camera, and even with good reviews online, and the help of the BestBuy staff, I found out the audio on the camera was terrible. Just a problem with that model camera. We didn't know.The next day I returned the camera with its plan, and had the easiest transition with customer service too get a different camera. Within 10 minutes I was in and out with a new and better camera, and didn't spend an extra dime. It was perfect, and the new camera is great! Just one of the many great experiences at this Best Buy. I would give this other stars, but the store itself is super tiny, so selection can be limited (the only drawback).
other Won't be going there again. Our chicken was pink! Manager was a prick in regards to that and service was all around crappy.
other I love sprinkles cupcakes. I have also managed to go to every location except the 3 in so cal. Like every location, the taste and quality is consistent and delicious. I got the salt caramel, banana, and carrot this time around. Like always, it's delicious and lasts for as long as they say it does. My pup loves the pupcakes too. I would wait for these cupcakes any time.
other Great quality. Their Pad Thai with chicken is the best I've ever had. Fresh, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. Their Yupha's Fried Rice is delicious with the pineapple compliments. Their Red Curry gets a other star rating for just being Red Curry (it's not as creamy, fresh, or flavorful as Thai Basil on University). It's a neighborhood gem and I'm lucky enough to live right around the corner from Yupha's Thai Kitchen!Also, it's clean, bright, and has an inviting ambiance. It's perfect for a sit in casual dining experience, and even nice for takeout. Staff is friendly and attentive. Come here. Seriously.
other really, I can't believe this place has received such high reviews from people.my lady and i walked in, and were greeted rather rudely by a pretentious bitch at the front with a monotone "name please?", instead of a warm, friendly, french welcome to this rather charming looking place. we didn't have a reservation, which from the looks of how dead empty the place was, didn't seem like a problem. until the hostess whisked through her reservation list and explained she'd try to "fit us in". it was 6pm, the place had one other couple dining, and we were informed that the next party was arriving at 7:30. we weren't really looking to hang out. it would have be awfully lovely if yelpers would have informed of the need to MAKE RESERVATIONS before going in here, because if you don't, you're automatically a piece of shit according to the staff. sorry, i don't plan very much ahead. next time i will, and it won't be here.anyways, after debating for a minute or two with herself, the hostess decided we could "squeeze in" and sat us right on top of the other couple inside the restaurant. she informed us that we could cork our own wine, for their low low price of 9 fucking dollars. in words only office space could adequately describe,"coup des tartes, what is it exactly that you do?". the food was good, nothing spectacular for $25+ a plate. we got a salad with apples and nuts and bleu cheese, which was served warm. now this is the first warm salad i've had all of my life, and by no means am i some sort of wordly food expert, but i believe salad should be cold and crisp. not soggy and warm. yuck. the cordon bleu was tasty and filling, however, the wobbly table was an extreme annoyance when cutting through the chicken, but it was solved (with no thanks to the staff) by placing a jack-in-the-box gift card under the leg. i will admit, the mashed potatoes are some of the creamiest and best i've ever had. my lady got the pork tenderloin, which had a strange peppery-sweet pairing which i didn't particularly care for. we were broke for desert, so unfortunately we didn't get to try any tarts. you would think for a place that promotes itself as being so poise would get some fancier menus, other than a $.1other piece of cardstock copied in bulk at kinkos.this place was rather disappointing. i honestly thought it would be way more comfy and welcoming inside but it really wasn't. it presents itself as being so high class and french and oh-la-la wee wee, but when it comes down to it, it's still located in a tiny shack of a house at 16th street and highland. maybe if it were located in the biltmore i'd give it a bit more cred.
other Stop by today for California Burger and I also their chocolate brownie delight sundae.  It is probably one of the best sundaes I have ever had.  If you are a chocolate fan, this place is definitely something that you will want to try. The help is friendly and helpful.
other Gosh Darn It! They had to be good. I was hoping, since they are so close to my home  and right next to where I shop for groceries most often (Fresh & Easy), that they'd be horrible. Then I'd never have to go again... But, alas...too good to not go back, that's for sure!I've said it before, I'll say it again: if you don't like a lot of frosting, just wipe off the portion you don't want. Heck, if you're sitting next to me and my kids, they'll eat it for you!!I didn't think I was much of an frosting fan either so I wiped off most from the Chocolate Chip Caramel, only to find that the milk chocolate frosting covered with a caramel drizzle was UH-MAZING! Scraped that heap right back in my mouth where it belongs! Yum. Equally impressive it the dense, moist cake (as opposed to light and fluffy texture; these puppies are HEAVY). The White Chocolate Raspberry was chock-full of white chocolate chips and the frosting was not too sweet. It was the prettiest one as well, with white sprinkles and raspberry sauce drizzle. Thoroughly enjoyed the two other chocolate selections (Texas Milk Chocolate & Midnight Magic) as well--Yes! I had four, but only cut them in half so I could save the rest for (my husband) later.Bonus points for presentation (the box is adorable) and variety.
3 I went here last night with the BF and another couple, and we all had really high expectations for this place that just weren't met. Not to say it was bad, it wasn't, it just didn't live up to the hype. The space is very cute and warm feeling. I like how the chairs don't all match and it has a very homey feel. The service was also very good.The BF ordered their home made ginger ale and it was very interesting. It tasted like liquid ginger, which was pretty cool. For food, we started with the nosh plate, which was probably the best thing we got. It had this delicious onion jam type stuff with some crackers, cashews, some meat of sorts, and a really good cheese with dill on it. The onion on the cheese was soooo good. I could have just eaten that for dinner. Then we ordered mains. The BF and I shared the chicken and waffles and our friends got the mac and cheese and the flapjacks. I was not a huge fan of the chicken and waffles, and I was so excited for it! The waffles weren't crunchy at all, which I think would have been nice texturally, and the chicken was encased in the fried coating, but once you cut into it, the fried part just fell off. It didn't adhere to the chicken at all. Also, it was very thick and didn't have a ton of flavor. This was very strange. The sauce on the waffles was good, it was a honey butter or something, and the chicken was moist, but together, it was a disappointment. It did come with some wonderful green beans though.... they were seasoned and cooked perfectly. I tried my friend's flapjacks and thought they were a little strange tasting... but not bad. I didn't try the mac and cheese, but my friend thought it was good. We finished with a shortcake that has strawberries that were macerated with balsamic and basil and had some kind of cream in it. This was very good, I loved the earthy flavor that the basil brought to the dessert and the strawberries were flavorful and tasted fresh. Overall, it was good, but not great. Maybe I had too high expectations, but I probably wouldn't run back here in the future.
other Tonight at Noca PhoenixNo dinner -waited 1.other hours with no communication only to be told they were out of the fish I ordered left the restaurant other hrs later very hungry   Very disappointing
other I was very satisfied with the food here. We had wings (half bbq and half buffalo) and a BBQ sandwich.  The BBQ sauce was amazing, the buffalo sauce was not super special but perfectly acceptable.  The wings are made to order and SO worth the wait.  Portions were very good, and the coleslaw was also good.  The service was very friendly, she was funny and charming and a good server, too.  We will definitely be going back.  OH! I almost forgot to mention that they have all-you-can-eat days for wings and fish, AND they let you leave and come back for more (additional drink purchase required)!!!!
other So, yesterday morning, I actually had a prego craving.  I was in the mood for a smoothie for breakfast.  My traditional early morning oatmeal or yogurt breakfast was not going to do.  Baby wanted something else.  I head on over to this Jack-in-the Box, which is close to work.  I pull up, order my strawberry banana smoothie, and am promptly told that the "machine is broken".  Uh...well that sucks!  I pull up to the window and the person tells me that the machine is leaking (at least I think that's what he said).  But would be about 10 minutes and it would be up and running.  Now knowing the smoothie issues I had this morning, I dont think that the machine was broken.  The product just wasnt ready yet.
3 I moved to Phx about 6 months and since the beginning I have been hearing about Pizzeria Bianco. I also heard how freakin long you need to wait to get in. I tried it once at night and after an hour and 1other minutes I gave up. I couldn't help but wonder1. why don't they serve food outside?2. why don't they make the restaurant bigger?3. does the owner want to keep it small despite the negative experience for MANY people who have to wait for forever or just don't go because they don't want the hassle?Well, they they started serving lunch. Usually it's too far for me to run to during the work week but I happened to have a random day off and luckily I put this on my list.I was so happy to show up and see plenty of seats for me to choose from at the bar. Hallelujah, let's see what the fuss is all about. I had a tasty coke from a bottle (I'm rarely a caffeine drinker) and ordered the Margherita after debating whether to go red or white. other minutes after I ordered the friendly waitress told another customer at the bar that you could split the pizza and do half and half for yourself. Wish I woulda known!It took awhile to get my pizza but it was damn tasty. Maybe a 20-30 min wait tasty, but not a other hour wait tasty. Still good, still glad I went, still want to go again, definitely not at night, but lunch is my saving grace.
3 Food used to be a lot better, service too. Not awful though.
3 Good fish fry place. I've also had there Monster Burger- delish.
3 Went here Sunday for the Rockies vs Dodgers game. We got some great free seats just to the left of home plate. Love the awning that provides lots of shade to people who just want to watch the game from the top of the seat section. I heard that the game was sold out, but it looked maybe 75% full. Parking wasn't too bad for us. We actually parked maybe other lanes away from the stadium. The food was ok. This place just didn't have the spring training feel l've come to love. This really is too far of a drive for me and I truly love the vibe and energy I get from the crowds at older stadiums like Phoenix Muni and Tempe Diablo and even Hohokam and Scottsdale. This just didn't seem to compare.
3 We were here for a weekend during Spring Training and over St. Patrick's Day. Good location, within walking distance to Scottsdale Rd and also Camelback. Comfy beds and also friendly front desk. Here's the only issue: we had a hadicapped room. This I am sure is ADA compliant and that's great, but having an open shower in the bathroom that has slippery tiles can create a safety issue with slips and falls considering there is one drain that isn't elevated. So we had to put down about other towels on the floor that were drenched with water when we showered. Next time I'd like to stay in a non-handicapped room....Also on weekends, try to extend the breakfast hours past 9:30 please!
other They are wonderful!
other Tried this for the first time today.  While my hubbies french toast was wonderful and the kiddos enjoyed their meal, my biscuits and gravy tasted much like bacon grease and flour.  Sending it back and trying something else is what I would have liked to do, but the server never returned to check on us until my family was finished with their meal.  The owner did apologize and asked us to give them a try again.  Maybe I will, if the staff gets some training.  Everyone seemed completely overwhelmed.  It's too bad~as I love going out for breakfast.
other When my mom suggested we eat at a simple casual Mexican restaurant for her birthday/my brother's grad school graduation celebration, I was a little surprised. She herself has only been in one other Mexican restaurant years ago and loved it...no wait, I take that back. She's been in one other one but did not enjoy it as much as the first time. Eh. Anyhoo...My brother suggested Arriba because it is one of his favorite restaurants. (Note: I keep encouraging him to yelp about his favorite places in Phoenix since he lives there.) It was not terribly crowded for a Saturday afternoon, which was nice. I was pleased to learn that they have brunch options which is served until other PM on the weekends, if I recall. Up until the restaurant, I had trouble deciding what I wanted to eat since I had gained some weight being around family....eh, that happens right? I opted for the make your own omelet, and it came with beans and some potatoes. The potatoes were bland and needed a little salt for flavor. My dad who has never stepped in a Mexican restaurant, only because he is not a huge fan or an expert in Mexican cuisine, enjoyed his carne asada and rice. His plate was CLEAN! He did say he would come back again, and for my dad to say that is a good thing. My mom and brother shared some a lot of food, but honestly I was not paying attention to what they ordered. Oh and for dessert? We had 3 orders of the flan. I still stand by that my mom makes the best leche flan ever, but the one at Arriba was just as tasty. I think the cinnamon sprinkles help. ;-)  Overall, I would have to say that we as a family enjoyed this place. Sadly, our trip in Phoenix was too short otherwise we would have gone back for at least a second round. We were seated right away and had great service. PS: The little to-go menus at the front are slightly different than the big menus at the table. I only know because my dad wanted to order something else from the small menu, and apparently it is only served during the week.
other This place is awesome. Just bought a loose super powers darkseid. Will def be back for more. Lots of loose figures. Great prices and friendly staff.
3 Overall , I like this place. A smal hole-in-the-wall place with straight forward, cheap, non-greasy Mexican food. I can dig it. I personally think the one on 7th st is better, but I will chock it up to growing pains since this location's only been open for about a week. I went today for my all time favorite Torta, but they didn't grill my bread so it wasn't nearly as awesome as it usually is...yes, I'm picky
other Very nice views of Phoenix. Not a very challenging hike but very enjoyable. Gets steep at the very top but a couple of hard steps will get you to a nice view
other Paradise Bakery is one of those places that you can count on for always having something good when your driving around wanting more than a burger and not a sit down meal with a waiter. I love the Cranberry Turkey sandwich with fresh fruit. The nice thing to consider is that you can get a whole or a half on the sandwich of your choice.Once you feel good about the healthy choices you've made you encounter the cookie section at the register. All I'm going to say is that the chocolate chip is to die for!! The chocolate chips just melt in your hands!! Doesn't get any better than that!! Paradise Bakery does also have a great breakfast should you want a nice place to go after a nice hike or just want to treat yourself and a friend to great place to visit. Put Paradise Bakery on your "always good" list!!
other Maybe I'm ordering the wrong stuff, but I've *always* been disappointed in the grub at 5&Diner... The service was STELLAR and I really do like the ability to dine Al-Fresco at 3am, but does everything need to be soaked in butter flavored crisco??? ughghg.
other This store used to be closer to 19th Ave & Bell they have since moved and expanded a ton over the last few years. Everything is made fresh daily ceviche, guacamole, salsa's, they have pan dulce delivered every morning yummm. You can pick up the old school soda's here, and good Mexican Favs like Pinguinos, Gansitos, Duvalin, Pelon Pelo Rico, De Las Rosa, and even Bimbo bread just to name a few thing's they carry here. They have natural all organic small game hens that can be stuffed or bbq'd you can ask for their rub they have all kinds of meat most get the Ranchera here for some carne asada you just need to be able to say how many "Libras" (Pounds) and you want them to make it "Preparada" they will put in their special marinade w oranges, onions, and spices in the bag. If your a meat eater you cant go wrong here. I cant get enough of this place!!
other I needed new tires & other months later my husband. Both experiences the staff went out of their way to either get it done on time or make it work price wise! I have always used them for my tire needs and we travel for jobs so we need them a lot,
3 Taco Bell/Pizza Hut combo on Dobson and Southern. Typical taco bell food and service. Lunch is very busy at this location because it is within walking distance of MCC, Pima Medical Institute, Banner Desert Hospital and a gazillion apartment complexes. Parking is easy, but this shopping center is very difficult to get in or out of during rush hour.
other Hey hotel room snobs, I am totally with you that swank hotel rooms are the best. But when that's not in your budget & you just need a decent place to crash in Old Town, this is your place. I think my room was like $48 a night. That's cheaper than a cab ride home for some people.Plus they have free, albeit somewhat dodgy breakfast in the morning. I stayed for a few days, did some shopping & drinking. I could walk to Fashion Square, & cabs were cheap to anywhere in Old Town. Sure these places haven't been remodeled since the eighties, but who cares when there's free wifi!
other LOVE it here.  Small, homey, and yummy food.  Great patio!  I love their veggie quesadilla and the beans are great.  It's nice to know they are lard free...which means you can eat vegetarian or vegan here easily!  The kid loves it...especially the beans.  They have jamaica, horchata and tamarindo fresh made to drink too.  YUM!
other We were staying at a local hotel and used online ordering to feed our crew.  The ordering went smoothly and the pleasant surprise was the food arrived early and warm.  We ordered two of their usual pizzas and one of our custom orders.  Could have had a few more toppings on one of them, but overall nice value and timely service with warm food.  We looked for the specials on-line and save a few dollars.  Worth the time to do so.  Would order again.
other OK. So I think that this may be the first business that gets one star from me.  I just flew home from Israel on this airlines.  Boy, they are pretty sad.  I usually don't like to be too harsh on anyone, but this airlines deserves it.  Please, don't think of this review as complaining, but rather a warning to others out there to never fly US airways (Nobody likes a complainer right? Haha.).  Well, not never, but if you have no other choice.  I would venture to guess that this airlines is pretty cheap because of the full flight loads that i encountered.  You could say that is good for them but the service on the planes was not up to par.  I guess I have been spoiled with the likes of Hawaiian Airlines, Nippon airlines, shoot, you can even throw Delta in there.  The flight attendants are rude. This is from both personal experience and from observation of my own.  You know what, I could go on and on, but I really don't like to cry about stuff.  Would I fly US Airways again? No way.  If it was one of the last airlines on Earth?  Maybe.  I just hope that their service of customers get better.  Then again, maybe they didnt treat me well for the fact that I hadn't shaved and looked Talibanish.  Oops.
other I came here a few weeks ago and I really loved it. I thought it was great that most of the ingredients were vegan and vegetarian friendly. My husband and I came here for breakfast. I had a strawberry banana smoothie and my husband had a chocolate, coffee peanut butter protein shake to die for. And we had bagels that were very tasty. I would love to come back here for lunch, everything sounded excellent, especially the soup. I was also impressed with the staff....I thought that was the best feature of this whole place. They are super friendly, and this one guy, was SOOOOOOOO Funny the way he was greeting people and making jokes. It was very outgoing and it made the customers feel like they had been coming there forever even if it was their first time. It also makes patrons and business owners feel like they are an important part of the community with the camaraderie that takes place here. I am looking forward to returning.
other Attention all parents, nannies, guardians etc.  Koko bees is tons of fun!  The kids are all smiles & full of laughter.  Terrific environment:  oodles of play houses,  dress ups, costumes, toys, themes & settings!  The little ones imaginations can run wild.  They even offer fantastic dance, sports, yoga and tumbling classes for the children!  This is a great place to come with the kiddos!!
other Best in south chandler.  Glad they are out here
3 The place isn't have bad.  I got a sweet and sour lunch combo, and it came out fine.  Their menus pretty thurough, and prices are really fair.  Its chinese food, and if your in the area, it should get you where you need to go.Place is clean, staff is friendly.  Would return for lunch here again soon.
other The food here is consistently good. We tend to come here annually at Christmastime while shopping at the mall. Went last week with the ladies and had the ultimate food envy watching my cohort eat a chicken salad sandwich. Came back this week to test it out and it is the BEST chicken salad sandwich I have ever eaten. May have to add this to my rotation of dining spots. My other dining mates had  the Shepards Pie, which was delicious and the grilled fish tacos which were also exceptional. I always have a sense of trepidation when I pore over the such an extensive menu. But 3 out of 3 dishes were a winner. Yet another chain with multiple locations in the valley.
other Kona grill is never a disappointment.  Sushi, the regular menu, the atmosphere.....  The staff is very friendly and the food is very good!  We like to create our own sushi dishes and the chef is always ready and willing!  I highly recommend Kona Grill for consistently good food!
other This review is for Gil's catering - which is fantastic.  Our perfect event for a new product launch needed to be casual, but tasty and high quality.  Gil's was all of these things.  The food presentation is pretty without pretension.  Everything was fantastic.  Best of all, Gil worked with us to plan an event within our budget.  Fare is traditional with a tasty twist - our group loved the chimis, taquitos, enchiladas and especially the chips.  We expected other servers and other showed up - including Gil.  They over delivered in every sense.
other Fair and honest prices.  Friends and I have been ripped off by other companies for the last several years wondering if there was anyone honest left.  During the summer, you're at the mercy of the air conditioning techs and usually they take advantage of it.I'm very happy with their service.  Very prompt and professional.   Father and son make a great team.Great warranty service.  An electronic part he installed died after 3 weeks.  He came out immediately and replaced the item for no charge.
other They must have had a slammed lunch as I came in around 1:30 ( by the time I found my way back from the old station) and for a new place the counters were dirty.  I hate when the counter help is eating in the dining room, I feel like I am inconveniencing them.  The vegetarian choices are limited and the Pho was good for 8 bucks.  I have eaten Pho at another place in Mesa and enjoyed it more. I won't run back to this one but if someone else was paying and wouldn't cave to other suggestions I would not die of it either.
other I love me some coffee. The french roast brew is perfect for surviving a long day of work. If you want something sweet, order the iced raspberry mocha. Just the right amount of sweetness without tasting like you're drinking syrup. The muffins are moist and delicious. The spinach salad here is surprisingly amazing (yes, they make spinach salad at this coffee place). The best part about this place? It is not full of hipsters and college students who hog all the decent seating and never leave. I can't wait to go back to try all of the other drinks offered.
other Finally, a pizza place that delivers to the Grayhawk area. Seriously, when I moved here over the summer and was unpacking I was shocked to learn that no one except Domino's delivers to Grayhawk. At all. Now, on my honeymoon in October I was in Giza, Egypt and saw that, if you stand with the Sphinx facing your back, you can see a Pizza Hut. Yes, that is correct, you can get pizza delivered to the Great Pyramids and Sphinx, but not to Grayhawk. But, now we have Zpizza, and it is good. The pizzas range from the usual to more inventive things, such as the Casablanca, which has artichokes. They also feature organic and healthy selections, such as soy or low fat cheese and wheat or gluten free crust. They salads are also fresh and tasty and, while I have not tried them, they also serve sandwiches.Overall, a good pie, wide selection and it delivers!
other $other pitchers of Four Peaks brews? That's an awesome happy hour!  Bruschetta is amazing... $13 is a bit much for it, but still super tasty!  Great environment. Happy staff. Killer design and music.  Great location.  Love it!
other Since I moved to AZ from Los Angeles I have been searching far and wide for a sushi place that met my high standards for great sushi. Sakana is hands down the best in town. The fish is fresh, the rolls are huge and nothing beats the .50 cent appetizers when you buy a beer! I recommend going on a weeknight, Friday and Saturday nights can fill up pretty quickly so you might have to wait.... but it's worth it.
other I decided to go to this location because its closer than the Scottsdale one where I originally got my contact lens prescription. Next time I will drive to Scottsdale to avoid the terrible service. Ended up waiting nearly 30 minutes just to get my new contacts. There was only one guy working the optical department and a massive amount of people and phone calls coming in. Obviously they need to staff better because you could tell he was getting flustered and was blatantly rude to a couple of the customers ahead of me. For my new (disposable) contacts it was $50. $50 for a two-week prescription! Are you freaking kidding me? Needless to say I went in with a headache and left with a migraine.Oh and on top of that I thought getting a slice of delicious Costco pizza would help after such a crap experience but alas I was wrong. The lady at the food court (again there was only ONE person working) was rude and I felt I was in a drill line. She literally threw my receipt at me. Well, geeze thanks. Oh and the pizza definitely didn't taste like the Costco pizza I'm used to.Furthermore, what the hell is wrong with people who live over here? Not only were the employees rude but so were the customers.Three strikes and I'm out of there.
other Being a San Jose native, I know Pho and Vietnamese cuisine. Let me tell you, Khai Hoan is excellent.  Definitely the best I have had in AZ and comparable to the best noodle houses in San Jose.  The pho (rice noodle soup) is great- beef or chicken.  The dry noodles and rice dishes are generous portions, and very tasty.  Great ingredients in everything.  Make sure you get an order of spring rolls.  . .   If you have not had Vietnamese food, check it out!  It is fantastic.  If you have had Vietnamese, go to Khai Hoan and you will not be disappointed.
other So many great things to say about this place where do I begin....WITH THE HOUSE MARGARITAS OF COURSE!! Hands down THE best house margarita I have EVER had. No syrups or mixes, this is straight tequila and lime juice baby, very refreshing and delicious! And for other bucks on a Monday evening, how can you go wrong?Their specials are all very good: Margarita Monday (as mentioned) with half price Apps, and Taco Tuesday with their dollar tacos and $other tecate's...HELL YA. They have a great range of tacos here and all are pretty delicious. Try the nachos with Al Pastor on them too, delicioso! Their chips and salsas also kick ass. If youre looking for a low key place to hang out, snack, and drink then you'll enjoy this place and if you love margarita's then you'll REALLY enjoy this place
other Mesa Amphitheatre is easily my favorite concert venue in the Phoenix area.  You can see and hear from anywhere in the place, and the grassy risers were such a good idea.  The sound was excellent for the two shows I've been to there.  Really just an overall nice, peaceful place to see a show and enjoy the Arizona weather.  Parking isn't too bad and neither are the lines to get in where they check your bags.  To top it all of, getting out of there was a breeze both times I was there.
other We came here for lunch and were a little leery when we first walked in. I had the cream of leek soup, my mother had the sausage salad, and my aunt had the Greek salad and we were all very impressed. We took a bangers and mash pasty to go, but we are so full, that it'll be awhile before we can try it. The service was a little slow, but the quality of food and atmosphere made up for the inconvenience.
other Very slow service. Food is typical for BK.
other Cool place in downtown!  I've been to all of the iterations of the restaurant and all of them have been pretty cool.  The happy hour is a great deal and the bartenders are really nice.
other I still like Lux better. Cartel is very appealing, though, to those who know their coffee. The menu is not huge, but it does offer basic, good drinks. They have plenty of syrups to flavor your drinks, if that's what you're into.I like the atmosphere in there, and the bike wheel "art" is pretty interesting and unique.This place is probably really great to study in, considering the fact that I see a sea of macbook apples every time I walk in here. The employees are funny and nice. Anyway, it is definitely worth checking out.
other Sitting at the counter at FnB is an experience that should be had, period. Our reservations by default was later on in the evening, but also turned out to be quite fortuitous. Not only were we able to see chefs Badman and Curry in action, but also saw them turn down the kitchen towards the end of the night. It is a display that even the most advent epicurean is not often exposed to. There are no doors or walls to hide behind. Everything that you eventually place in your mouth is out in the open and also in the way it is prepared - from the raw, to the stove, to the plate. Impressive was also how fluid the kitchen moved with only the two chefs preparing dishes. Chef Curry preparing the appetizers, fish and fowl; while Chef Badman shoveled coal onto a grill and simultaneously manning it to ensure rib-eyes were cooked to order. The ambiance was the type you'd expect when invited into another's kitchen, and the food tasted as if given the same attention. So to the service. Our waitress, Chantelle was nice about explaining everything to us after hearing that it was our first time there. When she found out we had moved just a few months ago, she was kind enough to write down her restaurant recommendations for us too. Will definitely be back to try other items off their ever-evolving menu. Reservation for two please. Yes its okay if its at the counter and yes, its fine if its late.
other Nearly 3 years after a Waikiki vacation, my longing for a Puka dog has been satisfied. Maui Dog is not exactly the same, nor should it be, but it has the same awesome concept, plus more! I've been here twice, once had a beef dog, the other a turkey dog. Both with mild garlic mayo & pineapple. These suckers are huge! And messy! And delicious! The dog has good flavor, mixed with the slightly sweet bun, spicy mayo and sweet pineapple...perfect! I think it would have been a better eating experience if my order was not to-go. The mess these things make all wrapped up is not pretty, but that absolutely does not deter from the taste. I can't wait till I have the time to eat-in and try the rest of their tasty-sounding menu!
other A dark night in a city that knows how to keep its secrets. But on the 12th floor of the Acme building, one man is trying to find the answers to life's persistent questions: Guy Noir, Private Eye. (THEME) It was a night in November. November 23rd in fact. I remember the date because it was my birthday. The snow birds that had started to flock from their summer homes had long since retired for the evening and the godfearing people of Phoenix had closed shop. My two lovely companions and I were looking for a place to fill our bellies. Like moths to a flame we were attracted to a dim light coming from a dark parking lot. We exited the car."Are you going to Mama Mia's?"A beautiful petite girl with the kind of body men write home about stepped out of the shadows. I was going wherever she took me.We were led through the kind of kitchen you only see in mob movies. I wasn't going to ask what they put in the sausage.We stepped in and figured out our toppings. Trying to figure out toppings for one pizza between three people you may as well be figuring out cold fusion with a box of toothpicks and some masking tape. But with the plethora of options I felt like I had a bag of bananas in a monkey whore house and we narrowed it to basil and fresh tomato.The pizza was exactly what a tired and famished private eye like myself needed on a night like this.Man working  register- "Is that a wig?"Jetta-" Yeah its a wig."We left the pizza joint as happy as a twister in a trailer park.Jetta- "I am so getting a weave." (THEME MUSIC) A dark night in the city that knows how to keep its secrets, but a light shines on the 12th floor of the Acme Building -- Guy Noir, Private Eye?. (THEME UP AND OUT)
other I was extremely happy that we chose Cool Cuts other Kids for my son's first big boy hair cut. He was instantly comfortable and drawn in by all of the friendly things they have for children. He was given the choice of a movie or playing a video game, of course knowing exactly what he wants went straight for the video game (Sonic on XBOX). It was pretty much a breeze from that point the little guy was hypnotized and didn't even realize what was going on w/ his beautiful, lovely long hair =( obviously they need to focus on distracting the mom's lol! Jessie who cut my sons long hair was a doll, she didn't seem to be bothered by the mother breathing down her neck as she hacked off my little's hair or the boyfriend taking a copious amount of pictures and video of the whole event. In the end my son looked great and I was a happy mama, I couldn't have asked for a better experience.
other Sometimes you just gotta have a burger.  I was in the Scottsdale Rd/Grayhawk area and noticed this place where Nick's used to be.  I tasted their burger at the Scottsdale Culinary Festival's Burger Battle and thought it was really good.The CB&CB burger with tater tots really hit the spot for lunch.  The burger and carmelized onions worked together really well.  The tater tots were delicious.Overall it was a satisfying meal and I'll be back soon.
other Whoa! This is the kind of laid back, homegrown, down right delicious place I expect to find in Seattle - not Phoenix! What an awesome surprise. Came here for brunch on Sunday and was so impressed that I can say I will make it a point to come back! All the breads and desserts are made in house and I was told everything is made with fresh local ingredients when possible.The atmosphere is great. We sat outside and it was nice with prompt service, casual vibe that reminded me of Seattle or Portland, and the FOOD.... Wowie.There were three of us... all three did omelette's of different kinds. I recommend the Local Breeze, sans prosciutto. So good! You can get potatoes or spicy cottage cheese as a side - I went with the cottage cheese and it was delish. The bread is also amazing. Nice thick slices for the toast. Best whole wheat bread I've ever had in Phoenix.Speaking of the bread - they have a killer menu of different french toast options. If I had not been on carb restriction, I would have had one for sure. NEXT TIME. The PB&J and the Nutella sound especially good. Our friend got a half order and it looked terrific. I cannot stress how good everything was. But I can only give them other stars and not other because the coffee was really bad. A good brunch should have good coffee to go with. I will be back for brunch for sure and would also like to give them a try for dinner or lunch sometime. Give this place a shot in downtown Phoenix!
other Breakfast. The best crispy chicken fried steak and eggs this side of Texas. Served with country gravy, hash browns and garnished with a slice of cantaloupe and honey dew melon for under $7. The green chili cheese burger is also one of my favorites, served any time of day or night. Only down side is getting past all the unwashed morons gambling and chain smoking cigarettes.
other Excellent family owned business that knows how to make real Italian dishes!  Their prices are a little on the high side but you get plenty and it's good.  We had enough left over for next day's lunch. The waiter was nice and attentive even though it started to get packed at around 7ish. They even gave us free Amaretto drinks after dinner! :)  Going back for another romantic dinner soon.
other Very nice, classy decor all around, cleaner than most places I've seen. Seems like a place you'd wanna dress up for.Drinks could be a little cheaper ($9 a shot), but I figure it's Scottsdale, so whatevs..Music ranges anywhere from old school hip hop to top 40's music you hear straight from the radio.No cover, so that's always a plus.
other I LOVE PITA JUNGLE! Why aren't they in Chicago?! Damn this unhealthy meat-lovin city! Let's try something different...Anything I've had here was remarkable, and I've tried a couple of different Phoenix-based locations, so they're doing something right. Try the jalapeño hummus for a great spin to a Greek dish, and if you're really hungry, I highly recommend any of their lavosh pizzas. My favorite though? The Chipotle Chicken Lavosh Pizza, of course! It is delicious and mouth-watering.I deduct other star solely for the fact that their parking lot is VERY inconvenient and way too crowded.
other Impressed  , stopped other x before and the wait was to long . Made reservations for other this time.;).. Friends had recommened and raved about Becketts and had this on the short list for awhile. It was everything as advertised, ambiance very casual , GOOD Food, excellent service (  Adria was very good and made good recommendations ) and fair prices . Recommend the Osso  Bucco pork but not a bad meal by the group . Sunday is AZ winery special which is a nice touch , must try the Pimms cup cocktail excellent! Can't wait to go back!,!,
other This is a great hole in the wall shop off of Val Vista Rd. I've been getting the chicken salad sandwich since 2006 and it's the same ever since GREAT! Cookies and bread are awesome as well...
other This charming little cafe made my day-  the atmosphere is charming, clean, bright and warm....and the wait staff and cook were friendly and welcoming.... but the food?  the food was the best part.eclectic, delicious AND reasonably priced.I got an eggplant panini--called espaniclata or something- which came with a side salad.  The quesadilla I split with my coworker was surprising and sweet- good for a snack or dessert.  I wasn't a big fan of the chai (I stole a sip from a friend)---it was Indian, just not what I am used to- not as sweetAnyways, I went on Friday for lunch, and liked it so much I had to go back Sunday.  Again, fantastic.  I think I found a new love.
other This is a great QT for when you're driving through Phoenix on I-17. It's right off the freeway so it's perfect for stopping for gas and grabbing a tasty snack.Plus it's a QuikTrip, there isn't really any part of it that isn't awesome.
other Dave at Dave's Ashtanga is the best yoga teacher. He is kind, considerate, patient and a very nice person. He will take the time to show you a yoga move or asana. He is very knowledgeable about different subjects. What I like best is once he said, "here you can do nothing wrong."
other Finally, a great Asian fusion restaurant. The service was super friendly. They even got me Yoo-zu tea because they didn't have honey. Server was great also and gave us recommendations about the amount and food choices because we asked - very professional. Now, the food...- spicy wontons: mmmm deliciously fried to perfection and i absolutely love that wasabi sauce- shumai: ehhh..though a lot of people on yelp liked it, the skin was a little hard for me- sesame tofu: cute little deep friend tofu cubes- shabu style miso with shrip: warm light soup, definitely a must try- red thai curry: omygosh, that almost took off my tastebuds..i wouldn't recommend it unless you like spicy beyond jalapenosOverall, a great experience, delicious food, nice ambiance. Oh, everything fried tasted non-greasy and rather healthy - a rare treat. :)
other Why go to some new place that tries to recreate the ambiance of an old fashioned ice cream parlor when you can just go to an actual old-fashioned ice cream parlor? Unlike newer parlors, Mary Coyle's doesn't try to be self-referentially hip or ironic, they just serve good ice cream without pretense. The thing is, they must be doing something right since they're popular with all age ranges and different groups of people. Plus, it seems like the high school kids working there are having a good time and actually glad to see you when you come in.
other I've been to a few Ren Faires in various states (my favorite is in Larkspur, CO), and this is towards the top of my list.First of all, they have their shit together. From signs all down 60 assuring you that you're going the right way, to having a specific Ren Faire lane to a plethora of parking attendants, everything was organized perfectly.Before I talk about the Faire itself, I have to say I was incredibly impressed at how disability accessible this place was. Between tons and tons of handicap park, ramps into each store, first aid people walking around with red cross flags so you knew where the first aid was, and even handicap reserved seating at the joust.  I give them an A+ on that.The shops were great; found an excellent variety of things for sale.  I got a great cane, candles, incense, jewelry and more. Food was good too; lots of veggie and meat options. We got broccoli cheese soup in a bread bowl (soup was ok, bread bowl was super delicious!), falafel (good), chocolate covered nut rolls (delicious!) and a good juicy pickle.   Drinks were huge for the $3 we paid, and could be found all over.I also liked how much seating there was, both in sun and shade.  We were able to stay longer because of being able to take breaks.The staff themselves were nice, but I didn't feel that many of them were as "into" their rolls as other faires I've been to.  I'd say "good morrow" and get "how are you doing?" in return.  Not a big deal, but just would have bumped it up to other stars.Worth the $18 the tickets were at Frys? Yes, but just barely. I hope they don't raise their prices!
other The pharmacist at this CVS really cares about her customers. Always surprised that she remembers me. Their new Minute Clinic is a bonus. I believe it is the future as more and more of us move away from company supported health care.
other awesome iconic eatery! whenever i visit az i make it a point to stop off at this ultra friendly, fantastic tasting joint. yeah, it takes a while to figure out the ordering process, but the staff is super helpful, and after the first or second time, one can figure out the system. it's just that everything is abbreviated which requires some thought. i usually mix other entrees to get different flavors. love the jerk chicken and fiery pollo diablo.although they are known for their snicker doodles, my dessert is usually ordering another entree to take home for later! hands down one of my favorite eateries. i wish we had one in minneapolis, mn...i would probably eat there daily for lunch, ha!
other eeew. It started with a cranky waiter who told me that if I wanted to know the specials, then I should have read them on the board. The food was downhill from there. The entire place smelled like fried onions.
other This place is worse than the IRS, at least the IRS admits when they made a mistake. But these arrogant workers will be caught dead before they hear themselves say "sorry for the inconvenience" or "we made a mistake".  They gave me different information on two consecutive visits that I made, then Dorrie, some lady who obviously should not have been working that day because she was coughing phlegm all over my documents, then after she asked me to wait by the counter for 10 minutes while their system updated. I waited, other hour and 30 minutes later I finally went to the information counter and asked for Dorrie... I was told that she had gone to lunch 1other minutes ago and was told to go talk to another lady. She just dismissed me and I went to go talk to the new lady, who was also extremely rude and kept rolling her eyes and interrupting me before I could finish my sentences.  Basically i spent total of 3 and a half hours waiting and getting attitude and nothing was resolved because of their mis information and Dorries idiot customer service ethics and the last ladys pride..  not one person resolved anything and they all were too proud to say "we apologize for the inconvenice".  I recommend this place if you wanna be late to work other or more hours and having your mild mannered patience tested to the maximum.
other Expect no com TAM-foolery here....this joint is serious about their broken rice business! Endless options of different broken rice (aka com tam= deliciousness)  dishes which typically include shredded pork and whatever type of meat flavors your fancy, all within your $6-10 wallet budget! Service is prompt and efficient, menu is ez to follow, focus your energy on the broken rice dishes; thats what theyre known for. I highly recommend the shredded pork + pork chop + steamed egg combo that comes with a light pork broth on the side. The portion is HUGE and each component of the dish is so flavorful and unique, bringing together a fantastic symphony for your palate. My personal favorite is the steamed egg; there's just something about the soft and moist texture that compliments the broken rice. Go easy on the fish sauce (ngoc mam) they give you on the side (try adding Sriracha to the sauce to add some spice in your life), the dish is by far no means lacking in flavor/sodium. All at a pansy $5.99, I could really eat this all day...everyday!
other The newly branded Red Dragon Chinese & Mexican Food is a shiny new facade on an old favorite.  (pics of new sign, and old sign by dumpster)Formerly known as Daily Buffet,  http://www.yelp.com/biz/daily-buffet-phoenix#hrid:3-lmRTZ9YDgPxf6I2WGfHA  they offer an extensive menu.  Whatever investment they're making in this new branding, their menu certainly looks impressive.(pic)Their buffet is quite well-stocked for it's small size.Whether you prefer Chinese or Spanish fried rice, they have it.  Have a few picky kids that can't decide between Honey Sesame chicken and Cheese Enchiladas?  They've got you covered.The Mexican buffet table offers rice, beans, enchiladas, taquitos, and other rotating entrees such as marinated pork ribs or a scrumptious chicken mole, if you're lucky that day.The Chinese area includes lots of chicken and pork options, noodles, egg foo young, etc  --  standard americhino fare.  The pork ribs were very good, if a little chewy, and the sweet & sour pork was done in the style I prefer: Instead of breaded, dry peices that you put your own sauce on, or soupy watery liquid with floating veggies and meat, this had mostly meat, maybe a few carrot and onion peices, with a crispy outside covered in thick, gooey, sticky sauce, that itself got a little crispy.  (it almost starts to remind me of a candy apple when it gets like this, which I'm sure the taste buds love, but the teeth hate!)All is prepared well, hot, not too salty or greasy, and well replenished.Discard Pile is usually present, but also usually small.There were some hand-breaded onion rings that were super thick!  This thing was the size of a small donut in my hand! (pic) They have a perfectly crisped outside, with an inside akin to a hushpuppy or donut.Mmmm, "donionuts"....The salad bar area left a little to be desired, and there wasn't really a salsa to dip my taquitos in.  I made a nice little concoction of ketchup, pico de gallo, and sriracha sauce which suited the task way better than I could have ever thought.Jello squares are the only real dessert option, but if you haven't stuffed yourself full of this yummy indulgent food by that point, you really don't belong in a boofay now, do you?
other I've been to a ton of Pho places here in the valley, and this is the best one I've been to, by far.  The prices are reasonable and the Pho was fantastic.  The rolls were pretty good, but not the best I've had around here (that honor belongs to Saigon Pho, not too far from this place.  BBQ beef rolls there are fantastic, but I digress).  I haven't tried anything else at Pho Van, but it all looked pretty good too.  The place is super clean and the service was ridiculously fast (I don't know if it was just my luck or if that's a regular thing).I want to come back, but it's not close to my house.  However, it's worth the drive if you ever get that Pho craving.
other I registered at both the combo Toys R Us/Babies R Us store by my house (on Bell Rd) and finished up at this location, since it had a larger variety.Nice goody bag, ample selection of items. Furniture prices are over inflated, but that seems typical for all baby furniture. You get lots of coupons too once you sign up for their rewards program which come in really handy!There are changing tables in the restrooms as well as fantastic mother's rooms..which have a rocker, sofa, and changing tables, as well as wipes, diapers, etc. Great for breastfeeding discreetly!
other I think this Savers is getting their layout confused with Goodwill, which is like Target getting confused with Walmart; both in the same category, just one is more classier than the other. I used to live by this Savers and would frequent it every day yes, literally every day back when they used to have great items. Just pop in real quick. Over time they changed the layout and experimented with things. After visiting today I saw that now everything is so crowded based on the way they structured everything using the same space with the same amount of stuff. The shoes are racked above the clothes racks now. This is extremely, extremely annoying. There is no emoticon to express how annoyed I am by this move. I understand they are trying to make the shoes central to the clothes so they are in the same spot, the shoes are racked by size of course snaking down each aisle. Sooo to look at shoes you have to go down a couple of aisles waiting for people to get out of your way, rather than have them in one spot like they used to be. Of course people are not going to magically put back shoes where they belong so you might find shoes in the right place, or you might end of having to walk down each and every aisle looking at the shoe size stickers making sure they are not cute and your shoe size respectively. Savers, please correct this annoying inconvenience. Also if you genuinely find an item with a tag missing they won't sell the item to you. Listen I get it, this is such a high traffic thrift store that there is a good reason for this but you must wait until the next day for them to price the item and put it back, they won't hold it for you. They don't call a manager over to simply price the item out for you, so how is this good customer service for the innocent ones? Why punish everyone? Why not do like some other stores do and mark the clothing label with a washable marker so that way if the price tag comes off, based on the color they have a pricing system set up? Either way, end up taking the time to re-price and re-stock it again. They should also implement some type of buzzer at the jewelry counter, I don't know how many times I have gone there, not just this location, only to wait and wait finally having to ask a cashier to send someone over to help me because there is never anyone there. The service is always impatient at the counter too, I don't know about you but I like to make up my mind about a purchase! This place is just too picked over, it is nothing like it used to be in its heyday. Way crowded on weekends and busy in the evening. If you bring donations you get a coupon for $3-other off your min $10 purchase with a tax deductible tag. I will say housewares are your best bet here, good condition and best prices. If you are looking for generic clothing fine, but diamond in the rough stuff like I am accustomed to? no, you won't find that here.
other We have gone to two Grimaldi's locations.  This location is closer to where we live than the Old Town Scottsdale location and easier to access due to a better parking situation.We usually start with the small Antipasto (it helps keep the kids busy while we wait for our pizza).  My favorite part of the Antipasto is the red peppers, they are very flavorful and compliment the dish well.  We always order two pizzas, one small with cheese for the boys (there is no kids menu) and one large with half pepperoni, half garlic for my husband and I.  The quality of the pizza is always consistently great.  The garlic is not overpowering and is complimented well by the coal-fired flavor from the oven.  The pepperoni is very tasty and even a little on the spicy side.  The pizza is so fresh and delicious we have to persuade ourselves into saving some slices for the next day.  We love to have a cold slice for breakfast!The only issue we have had at this location is plates with food residue.  We asked our server for two clean plates and one of them was dirty as well. He returned with another clean one and we had no other issues.  We only had an issue with the plates one time, so I would not say it is a chronic problem.We always finish with a cannoli, they are too good to pass up!  They are filled with a rich cream with chocolate chips mixed in and sprinkled on top.  It is the perfect ending to a great meal!Overall we always have a good experience when we go to Grimaldi's.  We have never had to wait for a table at this location, which is great when dining out with children!  I always recommend Grimaldi's to my co-workers and friends who are looking for great pizza.  On our last visit I got a free one topping large pizza for my birthday after I signed up for their mailing list! Great perk for a fan of Grimaldi's!  I would recommend giving them a shot if you appreciate a great slice!
other The best burgers in Phoenix. The owners are great and am on a first name basis. Forget about fast food and support this local business. Go double.Add bacon.Park at Circle K if in a hurry.Plan on holding it until you get home.Stick to the burger and fries, genius.
other One of the best breakfast burrito selections in town.My personal favorite is the breakfast supreme w/ red sauce ( and root beer the size of my head).The decor may be meh, but the quality of the food more than makes up for it. They deliver, are always nice, and never busy (which is unfortunate). Definitely a diamond in the rough.
3 Zipps has good bar food, but the service is usually horrible. The waitresses rarely come to your table. BUT, what really rubs me the wrong way is this....On multiple occasions, when I pay the bill, the waiter doesn't bring me back the correct change. Even if my change is other cent, I'm entitled to receive my money back. I'm sorry, but not giving me back my  change because you deem it insignificant doesn't float well with me. They do have great food though.
other This place is not there anymore.
other Clean facility, prices are super low! You can't go wong with saving money!
other I have been going to Elite Nails for two years and they have always been wonderful!  People see my nails and always ask where I go.  I highly recommend.
other This Mexican food is very simple, slightly bland, but fairly fresh. The chicken is chopped up into tofu-looking squares. But I was satisfied with the food, which was fairly healthy Mexican food as Mexican food goes. The staff is quite polite. I met some cool people hanging out there while I sat outside.
3 The food and drinks are blah, but the service is always great! Happy hour and trivia are always fun at Skip & Jan's.
other I love osso bucco, they have really good mexi-style osso bucco, so I love them.  I prefer to sit on the patio or in the bar.  But keep in mind, parking sucks if you go on a busy night.
other I've been here for dinner and the food was pretty tasty. The mixed grill platter is a definite recommendation, and the chicken biryani was full of flavor. The only downside was that the naan was just ok. Not straight out of a tandoor like naans should be.Their weekend brunch was decent but kind of disappointing. The chicken tikkas were kind of bland and there were no fresh puris to go along with the channa and halwa. But all in all, a good tasty experience and definitely one of the better IndoPak restaurants in the Valley.
other I will have to admit that I was not a huge fan of the Keg, as I have been to the Chandler Mall location and I was not impressed. I was hesitant to try the new location at the San Tan Mall, but I tried it anyway. I have been there 3 times in the last 3 months, and I am glad that I did.I thought the waitstaff was excellent and very helpful every time I went there, and their menu has some really great choices. The bar was very nice and clean and the outside patio is pretty awesome. If you go during the cooler months, they have a nice fireplace and comfortable seating. The prices are similar to Outback, but the food is far better.I will be returning.
3 I came out here Halloween to party, since everything place on Mill had a line we just picked this one place to party for the night. Drinks are cheap, I was shocked at how low the bill was at the end of the night after buying rounds of drinks until our party got their buzz on, but maybe its just me used to Hollywood prices. T_T Out in LA you get used to paying for parking, cover and then exorbitant prices for drinks.  I love their signature cherry vodka drink, its tasty! Its kinda like a Shirley Temple?! Service at the bar was quick for the amount of people there. Plenty of room for dancing which is always a plus.
other Great place for Sushi, ordered the Musscles ( Caution very large order even with only four) Great wine. Ordered Eel Crunch Roll, Tuna Roll, Soft Shell Crab Roll. All of it was to die for. A little Gem.  Pricing is competitive not high or low. Environment is pleasant, service was wonderful and waitress was very helpful with suggestions and information.
3 I noticed the sign for Shakey Jake's before it even opened. I waited paitiently for it to wait... I love barbeque! :) When it finally opened, my mom and I tried to get some grub there when we walked up, the cutest little boy came out of the resturant and told us they were close and would be open again tomorrow. We left disappointed but still wanted to give Jake's a try.Over a month later, we finally did get a chance to do just that.We entered Shakey Jakes and saw a nice, new & clean place. There was a large counter, and several red t-shirt wearing workers dishing up what looked & smelled like yummy barbeque. We waited in line and were handed menus. The walkways were narrow and left a small amount of space to sit. We were feeling the scrunch! We then sat down with our menus and chose our meals.I went back to the register & was disappointed in the fact that they didn't have any more MacNCheese and there was some miscommunication when it came to my mom's order. I thought it came with Fries... and it didn't, it comes with a side dish. My mom wanted Cole Slaw AND fries... instead I accidentily ordred JUST cole slaw... but they charged me an extra fee for the cole slaw... so really, I just got screwed out of a side dish and it was pretty much downhill from there.I didn't see the lil baskets of utensils and lids and straws on top of the very tall deli case. I had to take our recipt and the cups and I pourd our drinks and sat down. The TVs were SO damned loud we were shouting at eachother. I wanted to scream "can you PLEASE turn that down?!" My mom had to use the rest room and I told her she needed a key, which I learned from a previous review.Anyway, finally our food came and our order number was called and I got up thinking I had to bring it to the table, when their server told me to sit down and that she'd bring it to us... ummm... okay? but as she did, she told us that the utensils were by the register. WTF?! ARGHHH!! I was JUST there!! It was ackward, uncomfortable, annoying and frustrating.So i got up AGAIN, if I could have just picked up my own order, I could have also gotten my utensils in one big graceful swoop. I THINK the owners need to give out those lil numbers for their tables, think Carl's Jr. So there's no more confusion. AND give out those lil bags with utensils, napkin, salt & pepper packets. Because I'm 5'6" and I had to get on my TIPPY Toes to see what the hell was in those baskets! Also, I ordered two medium sodas, and none of their lids fit. They were TOO small or TOO large!The cashier was really nice, but the smaller things made this place intolerable. I couldn't walk to our table without hitting EACH and every single table and chair... ugh, that's the last thing I need. a reminder that maybe having yet another meal out is the LAST thing I should be subjecting my body to.I sat down and looked at my plate, the fuck?! I ordered pork ribs, and they gave me beef. I looked at the recipt and it said... beef. *harsh sigh* lucky for them, they both cost the same! I remembered reading their sign underneith the cashier that said they'd be happy to help you out if there's anything wrong with your order IF the food was untouched and IF you still had your recipt. sooooo... because the cashier hit beef instead of pork and I paid - I was screwed.Choosing to just go with it, I opened up my side dishes and the yams were good. nothing great, but still good. The cole slaw was way too sweet for me. The corn bread was good!! The highlight of the meal! their cornbread is better than LoLo's! There I said it! I just wish Shakey Jake's would make theirs bigger. The ribs were VERY good, they had a serious smoke ring and the sauce had a nice bite to it. My mom didn't care for her sandwich, she said there wasn't enough sauce and that the meat was very fatty. She liked the yams and the coleslaw. We both agreed that the peach cobbler was YUMMY! I just wish they baked it longer.When we left, I was full and not as aggravated like I was before. I do want to give Shakey Jake's another chance (maybe without my mom). To my yelpers, if you go - be sure the check your recipt, get your utensils right after you order & expect a server to bring your food when it's done.
other For some reason these self serve frozen yogurt places have popped up all over the valley and they are all very similar. What I like about this place are the choices. I usually don't have any issues, I'm a mint chocolate chip man, and that's typically what I order. My girlfriend on the other hand likes to mix it up and try new flavors and toppings. This place has the largest selection of flavors and toppings of any of the self served frozen yogurt places we've been too. For those of you who are calorie conscience, as I am, they post the nutrition facts right buy the flavor so you know exactly what you're getting.
other Yes, the place is busy every time I go there, and it takes 20 minutes or so to get your orderYes, the inside is cheesy and cheap with folding tables and could definitely use a makeoverYes, the location is...ummm...well lets just say its a "working class neighborhood"BUT they've got the best fish tacos I've ever had, and everything on their Mexico City street food style menu is outstanding. The $other tacos are "mini-tacos" so get 3 or other of them, a couple of fish tacos, maybe a side of rice and/or beans and you will be all set.Go there. Just leave yourself plenty of time, it's well worth the wait.
3 Manager got a little whiney when I insisted that he check his shelf before I drive out to pick up a rare item.  Their stock has been in error before, and sure enough... it was wrong this time.  But no apology of course, and no acknowledgment that I was right to have him check his stock.  Otherwise, selection is good on the whole, but customer service can be a little "iffy" at times.  Easy access right off Lake Pleasant Pkwy on SW corner.
other Had a great time, very family friendly!
other Nice facilities, nice AC, but two FATAL flaws:1. Children running around yelling and screaming at all times.  This is a failure of the parents and, more importantly, of the staff who apparently REFUSE to enforce any kind of policies against noise whatsover.To parents and staff: THIS IS A LIBRARY *NOT* A DAYCARE!!!!!2.  The "collection" here is 90% DVDs and "Dummies" books with trashy novels thrown in for good measure.
other I can't dance..yes I can!  Well tonight the hubby and I took our first dance lesson and what a hoot!  Had a blast.  The instructor's approach was clear and easy to follow.  She did a great job at blending focus on the instruction with keeping it fun and upbeat.  The facility is pleasant, immaculate and huge - and available to students for practice at any time, not just during their lessons.As mentioned in a previous review, they have a great deal for first time students.  The best thing for couples is that the price per lesson is the same whether for a single or a couple.   Because I've only done one lesson, and my first dance lesson every (well since high school, but the dinosaurs because extinct since then),  I'm looking forward to more lessons and the opportunity to add a star.
3 I know everyone has raved about this place. So naturally, I was was super excited to try it. I don't know if it was just so hyped up or what, but it just seemed like a normal pizza to me... with a really long wait.I was meeting some girlfriends there for lunch, we got there a few minutes early and asked to be seated, but they won't seat you until the whole party is there, unfortunately (although understandable!). So we stood outside, in the 108 degree heat until everyone got there. After waiting over an hour, they finally were able to seat us. We had three kiddos with us, and they told us they only had two high chairs. (Not a huge issue, but definitely not convenient either.)I thought their menu was extremely limited, only have 6 pizzas: 3 with red sauce and 3 with white sauce and then just a few toppings you could add.While the food was alright, I didn't find it over-the-top or spectacular as I had expected. Needless to say, I'd have no problem going back but I probably wouldn't seek it out.
other Great multigrain sandwiches. Nice patio too!
other I used to frequent the Buffalo Wild Wings on Litchfield and Bell and never had a bad experience.  Whether it was fight night on a Saturday evening or a lazy Tuesday dinner, I never was worried about the overall experience at that location.This location, on the other hand, could take some hints from there now defunct location to the west.  I have been to this location other times with each visit hoping the previous one was a fluke.  I always would get their flagship item as well, wings.  I like the spicy garlic which I find as the best balance between flavor and heat.  Each time the chicken was either overcooked, under sauced, or both.  Why can't they do their staple item right each and every time?  Major disappointment, times 4.I won't elaborate on the other shortcomings of this location because they are too many.  The bullet points are that the service is very lackadaisical with anything.  You sit down waiting longer for the service to take your order than it takes to get it out to you.  On multiple occasions a buddy of mine who I went with each time felt compelled to recite Reservoir Dogs lines when it came to drink refills.  They were few and far between.  Finally, I don't sit at the bar because I like to speak with the company I am in, but that was virtually impossible.  This wasn't just on event nights either.  The volume of the speakers didn't vary anytime, not even in the middle of the week during lunch.I want a good Buffalo Wild Wings in my area badly.  I have to travel to get to this location and would happily if they delivered on what I was used to.  I guess I am off to find another of the few that are actually still open until I see this location pick up its game.
other Excellent food! I always get the 3tacos! Best bang for your buck!
other Angry Bro Bar !  Please go here if you wear size smedium affliction shirts you will love it. The bar is lame. Kid you not there was not five minutes that went by where two people didn't try and fight each other.
other I' m psycho for this place.  The sell cupcakes now! (Ollie Cake)  and have longer hours of operations I believe ( I want to say until 7?)  NOM NOM NOM.
3 We stayed for three nights while visiting family for the holidays.Good:Very comfortable bedCleanFunky/cool decor which is uniqueVery friendly and helpful staffFair priceGreat locationNot so good:Pricey overnight parking that was a surprise upon check inNo coffee maker in room; this is pretty well standard for most hotels. We had to either go to the lobby for $4.50 per cup or drive off site. On our final morning before leaving (other 1/other hours before checkout) with our do not disturb sign duly mounted on the outside of our door, we were disturbed by a rap-rap-rap-rap of who I assume was the cleaner. WTF!
other Ate there for the first time last night and the food was fantastic. They did a great job on the remodel, so it's a lot more open than it was before. They have an extensive wine list and the service was wonderful. We will definitely go back!
other Hubby and I were here tonight for a grand and glorious breaking of his diet. He had been before to the one in Houston, and had been looking forward to the new Scottsdale location. For being open only 3 nights, the service went quite smoothly and the staff and management we met were all great. We started out with drinks- a gin and tonic ($10) and a caipirinha ($8.25)- both were strong and very good. The wine list is extensive, for those who prefer the vino. Delicious little popovers arrived at the table, and we headed off to the salad bar. Far better and fresher than Fogo E Brasa's, it had a variety of cheeses (including chunks of parm and fresh mozzarella), smoked salmon, prosciutto, salami, sun dried tomatoes, olives, marinated bell peppers, asparagus spears, mushroom caps, and seafood and chicken salads, just to name about a third of the offerings.Then came a veritable torrent of meat. The beef was the best, and came in a variety of cuts and preparations. We liked the Ancho (rib eye), the Picanha (the classic sirloin cut in the half moon shape), and the garlic beef best. The pork ribs were really well done and juicy, and the sausage was quite flavorful. The chicken was a tad dry, and the lamb was too gamey for our liking (and we usually like lamb). Side dishes were brought to our table, in appropriately modest portions. There were squares of polenta, which I really liked but Hubby did not care for, and mildly garlic mashed potatoes, and yummy fried plantains. Dessert choices were pretty typical: a creme brulee, a flan, other types of cheesecake, and other types of chocolate cake. Hubby wanted what he had enjoyed at the Houston Fogo before: the papaya cream topped with creme de cassis liqueur ($8.25). It was more runny than mousse-y, and the papaya taste was pretty subtle, with the liqueur being the top note.There is a rather unnecessary valet parking service for $3, when the parking lot surrounding the place is huge. Not so huge, however,  that the many douche-bags who double parked went unnoticed. The bathrooms are nice. The dinner, which is all you care to eat, is $42.50 per person. I'm sure we'll be back for special occasions.
3 I am a sucker for a theme restaurant. I have been wanting to visit this place for a while because of their whole gimmick. When you arrive a nurse checks you in, gives you a hospital wrist band, and dresses you in a hospital gown. Seriously, I love a gimmick more than the next person but the Heart Attack Grill is 100% gimmick and only 60% good food. The menu consists of burgers which vary only in the number of patties, french fries fried in lard, shakes, pure sugar coke, and PBR. They have a strict no sharing policy which completely bummed us out because we wanted to order the huge 20 patty burger and split it 3 ways. We ordered other single bypass burgers (one of our trio boycotted the burger because of the no sharing policy,) all you can eat lard fries, a vanilla shake, full sugar coke and a PBR. The burgers were ordinary, the fries were ordinary, and the service (aside from being dressed as naughty nurses) was ordinary. The only win was the delicious butterfat filled vanilla shake. The bill came to around $30, which is a bit pricey because remember only two of us actually had food. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it. It is a gimmick. Heart attack, fat, lard, waitresses dressed as nurses, cook dressed as doctors, sugar, beer...whatever. It gets old pretty fast.
other A yummy-in my tummy cozy spot! I met a friend for lunch here and was pleasantly surprised. The food is full of flavor and very reasonable. They give you huge portions, and the service is very friendly. I got a salad and the caprese bruchetta. What a perfect combo! The bold garlic taste of the bruschetta, washed down by a light salad. My salad had the perfect amount of dressing. I wish we had this place in So Cal, I would definitely come more often!
other This is our neighborhood restaurant.Whenever I want Margarita Sunrise and desserts, I went to Switch. I never disappoint.
other oOoh been here once for dinner and about three times for lunch...it's really a great place for a quick and easy meal and it's not too fatty like other fast foods..and it's pretty cheap. I love their 3 piece dark meat rotisserie chicken that comes with a delicious cornbread (I'm usually not fond of cornbread) and two choices of sides. I've had the creamed spinach, corn, veggie mix, squash mix, roasted herb red potatoes and sweet yam which is my least favorite....the sweet yam casserole is just too sweet for my taste...so not a big fan of that one..other than that the other sides are pretty good. The meatloaf meal is also really good...two really good size slice of meatloaf also with a choice of two sides and a cornbread...other bucks more expensive than the chicken but sometimes you want something besides chicken. hehSo for a quick easy cheap semi-healthy meal that does not consist of a hand full of grease (burgers, pizza, tacos of that sort..) then Boston Market is really a fantastic choice =)Yummers!
other I've been to this Pita Jungle a few times, about 3-other and ordered carry-out once. Every single time my experience was great. Great service, great food, and great atmosphere. I've ate at the patio once during a rare cold winter night, and the waiter, without us even asking, put a heater right next to us. It was really nice and kept us warm while we ate our food. At times it gets busy, but the wait has never been too long and annoying. This place is great, and compared to other Pita Jungle's I've been to (the one on Shea, Tempe, and Downtown Phoenix) this Pita Jungle has to be the best. The ambiance is nice, and the decor is very welcoming. A big open room for the dinning space works well.
3 Each time I eat here...I always look at the menu and end up having the same thing - the ceasar salad with salmon. Nothing else really interests me on the menu. The service is good - no complaints there. But its nothing special. But I will tel you this - there is nothing like a cold beer on a hot day!
other Have you ever eaten somewhere and just can't get the craving out of your head and you have to go back!  This is the place that does it to me.  I've decided I need to try everything on their menu!You have to try the Roasted Turkey and Stuffing it is to DIE for!  And the mac 'n cheese  so yummy.    I've also had the Prosciutto and Fig Jam sandwich and I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  I had that with fruit which was good.  Guess where I'm going for lunch... yeah there because I need it after doing this review.  :-)  Oh and before I forget... When the weather is nice sit out side!  You will love it.
other Large Goodwill location (formally a PetSmart), but dark like a cave. This one is hit or miss... It is clean for a Goodwill (I've seen some pretty dirty ones). Just need to keep checking to find the treasures here.
3 So, Jimmy Woo's. One thing that can't be argued is that they had a great interior decorator, right when I walked in, I loved the vibe. We were seated immediately, and promptly served. The service is excellent and efficient :) We started with the egg rolls as an appetizer which were dee-lish-ous! And I ordered off their fancy drink menu and got a Jimmy Palmer, yum! For entrees, which they serve family style, we got the Shanghai Delight (broccoli, snow peas, and shrimp in a sauce) and the Chinese Braised Short Ribs. It was pretty good food, a little less sauce though on both dishes would have been preferred. The shrimp was cooked alright, and the ribs were very tender with a somewhat smoky taste. Again, if there had been less sauce, I think I would have enjoyed it even more. Like a lot of other posh Chinese food places, as my mother said after we'd left, "Jimmy Woo's is simply glorified American-Chinese take-out." It's true, but it makes for a pretty good dinner in Old Town.
other Dr Brodkin is one of the greatest doctor out there.  She was voted two years in a row for arizona foothill top doctor and it shows!!!  She is caring, and overall great doctor.  She moved her office last year and wow did she change for the best.  The staff is great her new nurses i love love love....i recommend Dr Brodkin to anyone who need  a GYN....
other I just love this place and  I always leave feeling refreshed and relaxed.  Highly recommend any of their spa treatments.
other I don't intend to return, but based on the way we were treated by the kitchen earlier this week, my "uncouth" self doesn't exactly feel welcome anyway. However, I'm not quite convinced that it's my loss... It had been almost a year since my original visit to Breadfruit which did not overwhelm (as you can judge by it taking me a year to make it back) but I did have an appreciation of the option for Caribbean cuisine. Since a friend and I were going to be downtown for an event, I suggested Breadfruit for our dinner spot. We enjoy good food and supporting local. The option to pick up wine at the Public Market next door and have the already reasonable corkage fee waived was a bonus, as we had really enjoyed a couple of the Arizona Stronghold wines at a recent FnB wine pairing and thought they would pair well with the Jamaican heat! While the scallops were delicious and cooked perfectly, other for $12.50 -- $6.2other per scallop -- is a tad steep in my book. We also shared the Jerk Chicken Salad ($9.95) and the Jerk Prawns Off the Grill ($14.95). Here's the ultimate rub, the bottom of the menu states "no substitutions or modifications"... Since when is cutting a KFC-side-sized ear of corn a "modification"? At the same time, the menu describes the restaurant and it's offerings as "Nothing fancy; simply good food that nourishes and rejuvenates the body." It seems like cutting something in half so we could easily share it -- particularly after the plate has been delivered to the table for us to appreciate it's "beauty" AND after we've communicated to our server and demonstrated with the first two courses that we were splitting the items -- is in the vein of "nothing fancy." How about providing the customer with an appropriate utensil to cut it themselves, then? The fact that the chef was obstinate in refusing to cut the KFC-side-sized ear of corn provided with our entree screams "pretentious and grandiose" and tainted our entire experience. To quote my dinning companion, "You are not James Beard and James Beard would've cut the corn!"
other So, for more than a year, I drove by this place on my way to work but never checked it out. I wasn't sure what to make of a place with a walk-up takeout window. Last night, I followed a group of friends there for a late dinner. Didn't try any appetizers. I just split a 14' Italian special pizza--sausage, green olives and fresh garlic. The pizza was pretty good, not spectacular but definitely a couple steps above a place like Mamma Mia's whose pizza has a fast-food quality at times. Red Devil is very generous when it comes to toppings, at least on this one. I am an olive lover but haven't had green olives on pizza before. I enjoyed olives in every bite. But if you think olives are just okay, you might have found it a bit much. The pizza was kind of big for two people and with tax, it was about $18. So, I'd say it's fairly priced. I have to say that the service, more than the pizza, would draw me back. Servers who think of the little things before you even ask are much appreciated. We had a party of nine and our waiter was super patient. We also brought a birthday cake on the premises, which they allow. Our waiter started clearing all our plates and silverware and before I could ask, he said not to worry, he'd bring us clean plates and forks for the cake. He also saw someone with a camera and asked to take a picture. He just gave off a genuine vibe of being helpful. I would definitely consider it if in the mood for something casual but not carbon-copy fast food.
other This is a place that you want to go to if you're looking for fresh clean food- not if you want a large meal.  I left satisfied but not full.  The prices are a bit steeper for the amount of food that you get- but you are paying for quality, not quantity.  I opted for a salad which hit the spot- but could have been a tad bigger.... as a result we definitely had room for dessert.  I recommend the apple crisp :)
other I'm a complete dive bar junkie. Whether I'm in a big city, or small town I always seek out the local spots. I was in Tempe with work and we happened to drive into town right at last call so we searched for the closest bar which just happened to be Monkey Pants. After we got over laughing at the name and the paint job on their truck...we went in and were greeted by the waitress right away. It wasn't too busy especially for a Friday night but the place is huge! The bartender was very attentive and adorable.  I really wish I could've made another stop at this bar before I went back home..I saw a bunch of posters for all these theme nights and great deals. Reading previous reviews it sounds like they have parties going on like this all the time. Great bar!
other Went back, they appeared to have remodeled and noise level was greatly reduced.  Food, atmosphere, everything still wonderful.  In my first review, I stated "the only reason I'm giving it less than 5-stars is because of the noise level."  As the noise level issue appears to have been rectified, my review is subsequently being modified to reflect this.Last time I was there I had a salmon salad, which was good though in all honesty the salmon was the star of the dish.  I asked the server to please ask the chef how the salmon was cooked so such perfection.  I honestly did not expect for any type of response.  Lo and behold, a gentleman came out and explained the procedure utilized to get that sear and texture without overcooking or under-cooking the salmon.Re: Another reviewer's issue with "soggy fried calamari"It is tempura calamari, which is different from other ways to fry the calamari.  I have never had any issues with sogginess unless I leave it to sit for too long.  Hmm...  Clearly, they prefer Zinc Bistro.  Honestly, I haven't been to Zinc Bistro so I cannot draw a comparison at this time between the two.I will definitely go back as soon as I can to The Greene House -- Oh, loved the recent press on the Chef's high praise, it *is* well deserved!
other What would I do without this place?  They pretty much anything you need to make any Asian home cooked meals.  Very clean.  Fresh produce, fresh seafood, fresh meat.  I love how they have pre sliced meats.  This is definitely one of the largest Asian supermarkets in the valley.  Avoid the the other asian restaurants in the market though.  They're not very good.
3 I had the Potato Balls, they were larger than i expected (i'm used to the likes of Portos) but i was not discouraged from attempting to take them in all at once, alas i failed.. but i was a happy camper.
other "Wait, we're in Arizona?"" No seriously, this is Arizona?"I had to keep blinking cause I could've sworn we were still in the East Bay last Friday night as we waited for our faux meat meals to arrive at our table. My hubster and I were visiting his mom for the first time since she had moved to Phoenix and admittedly, neither of us were too stoked on the visit. We totally wanted to see her but as for Phoenix?? Anyways... she knew what she was doing by taking us straight from the airport to Green. I LOVED EVERYTHING. From our appetizers (hummus + fries) to my entree- I had the chicken curry noodle bowl, to my beverage- a suicide mixture of their house green tea and house limeade (YUM) to my soy ice cream treat (I had the mint with paul newman oreos!) which I scarfed down after being totally stuffed. This place is ridiculously good. And reasonably priced. And fresh. And not stuffy or pretentious in anyway. Basically, this would be our new steady if we lived anywhere near... Tempe. Which fortunately we do not, but I have to say, you Arizonians sure are stoked to have a place like Green.And now we have a reason to look forward to returning to AZ!! :D
other Count us in for a #other Combo, a Oaxaca Special & two hard tacos....maybe some chips and salsa to go!Best Mexican fast food around..and cheap!Always busy at lunch, but they get through the orders in a timely manner.  Seating can be tricky, so have one order and another stalk tables! :)You can park behind the place and walk through the back door....little FYI.
other Great addition to the Indian School corridor.  I love the location along the canal and the patio has great views of Camelback Mountain.  There is an extensive beer list and the drafts are reasonably priced.  The vibe is very cool and the bartender was extremely friendly and helpful.
3 It's not hard to find a steakhouse in Scottsdale.  Modern Steak's schtick is that it is... well, "modern" in the sense that it's not in a dark oak-filled room with overstuffed booths.  Unfortunately, however, "modern" also means that it's in a mall.  Ugh.Pretty efficient (if not brusque) service, with decent enough food.  I had the salmon w/ maple and bacon glaze.  It's a bit of a bizarre combo -- I'm not sure the salmon quite holds up under such a sweet glaze, but you can't complain too much anytime bacon is involved :)
other Canteen is my new favorite happy hour spot. You can get two orders of wonderful pork and habanero tacos, two orders of their tender ribs, an order of quite good chips and guacamole and a couple of margaritas for around twenty bucks, it's amazing. Add in the cool atmosphere and HUGE selection of tequilas(all half off during happy hour) and you have a recipe for success. Canteen is a very welcome addition to Mill Ave, and while it can get very loud, you simply cannot go wrong during happy hour.
other Not long ago I went and got takeout - and everything tasted kind of fishy.
other Ah what a beauty and wonder Camelback mountain is. However I do warn beginners to use the easier trail on the East side near Invergorden which runs north south and turns into 64th st. It is a bit of a walk from the parking through the neighborhood but the hike is less treacherous and much easier and takes you up a gradual slope to the top. Be very careful it's easy to loose the trail on that side too. Of course all the Phoenicians like to go to Echo Canyon at Mcdonald and 44th street bend. Parking can be bad at peak times on weekends--I definetely recommend late afternoon hiking, less exhaustion from heat, less crowds and a glorious sunset at the top. Happy Hiking my Dear Phoenicians.
other I don't usually shop at AJ's unless I am looking for something very specific that I cannot find anywhere else. The item in the past has been canoli shells. I like to make home made canolis occassionally but I am never daring enough to make the shells. I can never find them anywhere other than AJ's. I would say that if you are looking for something special that the average grocery store doesnt have, try AJ's. They are a bit expensive though so I would go here as a last resort. Now normally, I would give this place only 3 stars, however, yesterday, I discovered their dessert counter. OMG, I was in heaven! I knew they had cakes and fruit tarts (which btw are outstanding although 30.00 apiece), however, they also have a vast array of mini gourmet desserts for when you have a major sweet craving and want something special to satisfy it. Im talking mini carrot cakes, mini fruit tarts (yes!!! I dont have to pay 30.00 whenever I want a tart from them), mini tiramisu's rounds, brownies, canoli's (WTF?) and even mini creme brulees! Additionally, they have home made chocolates which looked equally delicious. I opted for the tiramisu which was not only tantalizing but light, creamy, and honestly, one of the best Tiramisu's Ive had in awhile probably since the wine train in Napa. My best friend said that her praline chocolates were very good as well. I got a brownie for the hubby which is enormous and I will post an update once he tries it. What's even better is that the mini desserts are really reasonably priced so if you are looking for a dessert for someone to celebrate a birthday, anniversary, whatever, this is a great place to go.
other Fabulous place.  The food is good and the selection of organic and specialty items is nice.  Love the butcher shop and Jerry the Cellarmaster is abslutely fantastic.  Seriously, if you want a bottle of wine - he is the best resource.  And if you go back frequently he tailors his suggestions to what you like.  My favorite thing about this store is that the staff tries so hard to treat you like a valuable customer.  They remember your name, ask after your kids and honestly act like they like you.  It feels like a small town grocery store and I love that.   Breakfast is fantastic and the coffee is great.  Everyone at the coffee counter is terrific.  This was a really great addition to the neighborhood.
3 Pretty tasty dogs.  Pretty long wait for a hot dog.
other The hyperbole around this restaurant is unreal.  "Oprah flies in specifically to eat there."  "New York Times and Bon Apetite rate it as the best Pizza in all of the U.S."  "Jimmy Kimmel hired Chris to build a personal brick oven in his own home"  "I ate their once and my eyesite was restored.......praise jesus!"There is no denying this is great pizza,  All of the ingredients are delicately chosen and prepared by the man himself, and he manages to pull flavors out of each that should not be humanly possible.If you live in AZ you owe it to yourself to try it at least once.  Steel yourself for a long wait, however, 3 hours isnt much if you've got friends and wine with you,  just dont get too drunk to taste your meal when its finally time to eat.
other This is my first time back in years. It will be my last. I was in the bar area for lunch it was almost 1hour 2other min before I could get out. Ten min before my drink order and almost as long before food order. A secound drink forget it. Guy next to me walked out.
other This store is too busy. Don't get me wrong, I love my Mac more than anything but the service at this store is god-awful. Luckily before purchasing my Mac I researched until I knew exactly what I wanted. I seemed to know more than the associate that helped me! Purchasing it was more of an awkward affair - I couldn't wait to get out of there. Also, it's always almost impossible to get into the Genius Bar. My iPod malfunctioned sometime earlier this year and after waiting in the store for 4other minutes to be seen, I was only informed that the damages were more in depth than they thought and I would need to schedule an appointment. It's just an iPod, people! The experience itself was more than frustrating. I stick with Amazon on this one.
3 Loved the room and its functionality but this same room made me want to punch myself in the face.  I'm a young professional in his mid 30's who likes to party and understands what the W brand provides (especially on the weekends during moneymaker time) but when their DJ on Saturday night sounds like he's spinning from your bathroom, it makes for a tough stay.  Got home at 12:30 a little buzzed and had a rave in my head until 2am.  Finally got to sleep and loved the room and hotel otherwise, but this will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. Maybe it's just a few rooms but 20other is a bad number here.
other Amazing sushi. Fast, clean, fresh. Friendly staff. Favorites are Arizona, Beauty, Alaska, and Spicy Ninja, although everything here is some of the best around hands down!
other I go to GB for the balcony and the hefeweisen.  One a warm sunny day there aren't many places I would rather relax.  Watching the people on Mill Ave as well as the planes flying into Phx can kill a few hours if you are bored.  The food is ok.  The hummus appetizer is usually a safe choice as is the pizza.
other Great place to grab some quick mexifood. Service at this location has been great. Fast and efficent. Try the pick two for a healthier smaller portions!
other Ok, so I've just come to the conclusion that it's not me....... it's YOU.I just don't like other peoples used, worn, busted up shit. That said, I really like My Sisters Closet. I've only been in a couple of times but I know potential when I see it in the form of a $400 Louis Vuitton bag. ( I wouldn't purchase it but I liked that it was there) I did pick up a pair of designer (not sure which one, don't really care) sunglasses for $14. Sure, they are probably *gasp* "last season's" or whatever but I don't care. They look hot and they cover almost my entire face which is something I look for in shades.I will be back soon to see what other goodies I can find. That $400 Louis really made me nervous though. Who has so much dough that they can just drop a perfectly good $1200 bag at consignment??........ and are they interested in adopting or marrying me...
other Unique selection of antiques, linen and assorted pictures and estate jewlery along with new timeless designs. Located in downtown Gilbert worth the trip!
other Ok, these guys get five stars from me for many reasons.  Before my visit today my other experience with them was for my wedding cake.  They were very courteous and helpful, although I ended up going with a cheaper option.  Today, however, they definitely earned five stars.I was there for a meetup event.  We got a tour of their facilities.  The owner personally did the tour, and did a great job considering I brought my toddler, who screamed through about 75% of the tour.  At the end, he gave us a cookie and thanked us for coming.  I know that some people think toddlers should be locked away so as not to annoy the general populous, but it's nice to know not everyone feels that way :)
other I am a huge fan of the Italian beef and of course everyone is going to have their favorite places and tastes. But this seemed like a place to satisfy a lot of different tastes. There are several sizes, extra meat is available and if you are getting it to go, I'd say go for it! Only order it regular if you are a fan of super dry sandwiches. I'd say go for wet if you are like lightly moist but if you are a big au ju fan like I am, definitely hook it up with the dipped!! They have american, cheddar and provolone cheese (pretty sad they didn't have the mozzarella). They giardiniera was pretty good as were the sweet peppers. It wasn't too greasy or hard to eat while driving.They did have a variety of other things to eat so definitely check those out if you aren't up for a beef...but thats what they are known for!!
other Excellent in every way.  Attentive and fun owners who tend bar every weekend night - GREAT live music, excellent wine selection.   Keeping Fountain Hills young.... one weekend at a time.
other One of my fave restaurants! The unlimited salad is a winner. It's delicious! They also have a gluten-free selection that my brother loves! For Christmas, they also have some gift card deals.
other When Tempe Market place was being put together...I though WOW a swanky place where college kids and laid back adults could get together and enjoy themselves.  Cadillac Ranch was being built...and the hype was hot enough to make you buy a meal ahead of time.  Read the reviews but thought...what they hey lets try it out.  And now I see why it has two stars...should have listened to the other yelpers -_-... went there is Good ole' Rada, thought it would be nice to enjoy the day outside.  Nearly Drowned by the ample amount of misters.  Thought to self...hmm well at least the food should be good.  Ordered the sliders meal... maybe they were scarce on meat, but the slider patties were the size of silver dollars, tasty but small.  Yes the service was slow; my glass was getting refilled faster by the misters than the actual waiter. It gets two stars in my book for the service and the overall experience (for lunch that is). you get what you pay for..and for 1other bucks, a couple barbie sized patties in human size buns, a not so 'AHH' diet coke, and other oz of wine (and that's on the 2.00 happy hour deal) ... kind of seems appropriate.  I recommend this if you are stuck hanging around Tempe Market place and you have just a few bucks and feel like getting close to full...and now I think that Tempe Market place took Mill Ave's charm...and they need to step up to compensate killing a once adorned chill out spot for ASU and Tempe.  Shopping is good...we could deff replace CR for perhaps Sakana? Who knows...Bye for now!
3 I've got alot of nice and not-so-nice things to say about Phoenix's latest venture into building serious public transportation.Nice Thing #1: Mainly because it's new, the cars are really clean. After living in LA and using the metro subway there, anything seems cleaner than that. Let's just hope they keep up the cleanliness of the light rail in the years to come.Nice Thing #2: It gets me from A to B with little to no problems. It gets the job done. Also, it's one of Phoenix's more serious efforts at going green, so it's worth backing.Nice Thing #3: All of the current downtown stops are well thought out. Once you step off, something is always walking distance.Nice Thing #4: The price of the all-day pass is worth it.Nice Thing #5: Unlike public transportation in LA, the light rail is generally on time and makes for a reliable means of getting around. There don't seem to be any car companies that are trying to choke-hold the city by shutting any stations down like they did in the 30's in LA.The cons...Bad Thing #1: The only logic in taking the light rail is that it's essentially a car you don't have to park or fill up on gas. It's not that it's slow, but it really only goes slightly faster than the cars driving next to it in the street. Part of the sluggishness of the light rail stems from the fact that it has to stop at traffic lights like the cars you decided not to drive. I think the smarter idea would've been to build the light rail above or under ground so it could have gone faster and not have to stop at lights or risk the chance of some idiot gunning it and T-boning one of the passenger cars.Bad Thing #2: I know this experiment is still in its training wheels stage, but I really wish that they would build a line that would go to North Phoenix, Scottsdale, or Glendale. I've heard that they are planning a Glendale route, but that's probably going to take another ten years. Even though I live a few blocks from one of the stops, I really wish I wasn't limited to downtown, Tempe, or Mesa.Bad Thing #3: No airport stop? I mean, there is, but you have to take a shuttle to the actual airport. Why not just build a stop there? It would make more sense.Bad thing #4: Why does this thing shut off at 11? Is Phoenix trying to kill any chance of building a real nightlife downtown? We're not children. This city shouldn't set a curfew before midnight on this.In all, the Valley Metro Rail is more yay than nay. It's got its kinks that it still needs to work out and it's kinda tough to judge something that's in what I hope is a very nascent form of what it will eventually become.
other I know its gonna sound a bit foolish when I divulge that I was actually a bit scared to enter the Roadrunner Lounge, but the truth is that I was.  Due to its lack of windows and barebones facade, I concluded that this bar had the possibility of being the sort of place where, when I opened the door, I might bare witness to a mob boss or two trying to decide what they should do with the man they just shot...  but that wasn't the case.What I discovered was a long corridor flanked by mirrored walls and strings of multicolored lights, as well as ample seating and classic video games to boot.  The games included PacMan and Golden Tee, accompanied by a dartboard and a pool table - enough to keep the gamer in any of us busy for at least a few hours of drink-sippin.The drinks were cheap and strong, and the tunes were decent - however the digital jukebox put a frown on my face; I hoped for a Wurlitzer.  Our barkeep was friendly and efficient, and our drinks were strong and low-priced.  I think tap beer's only two bucks, and mixers aren't too much more.In conclusion, the next time you're feeling a bit nostalgic, and you're looking for a watering hole off the beaten path, kick a few back at the Roadrunner.  Bottom's up!
other I ate here for the first time a few weeks ago on a Friday night/Saturday morning after seeing a show at the Tempe Improv.I came in around midnight and the place was not that busy. The waitress was pretty nice (did everything expected for a waitress) and the guy who I thought was the manager was easy to talk to. However, those are the only two good things I can say about the restaurant.I ordered the BBQ wings and they were TERRIBLE. The flavor was very bland and half cold. The blue cheese I ordered was quite watery as well.I also sat by the kitchen and noticed that a guy in the back was washing a stool in a sink near where the food was made. Needless to say, I won't be eating at Hooters anytime soon.
other Good choice for dim sum. Prompt efficient service, good food and reasonable prices.
other Great menu selection, food is hot and fresh and you can't beat the prices!
other I've decided to completely write this place off, and here is why you should too:THREE TIMES I have tried to go here and they have been closed, all the while their website and posted hours say they should be open. If one of you wants to drive all the way here from the suburbs, you'd better call first because this place cannot be trusted. I've wasted my time and spent hungry minutes walking here only to be disappointed. Vitamin T will fail, there I said it.
3 ok....first let me say that I grew up in PHX. And we used to go for special occasions to "Bobby MaGees" which is where BobbyQ's is now located (says something about the quality of my restaurant experiences as a young fella)...And as cheesy as Bobby McGaees was...i kind of miss the pirate serving me my dinner (and the salad bar in the bathtub).But i do like what they have done to the place. Cool interior. Casual but with a nice upscale feel. The patio seemed really nice (didn't sit out here).We tried a variety of things. A burger, a pulled pork sandwich, brisket, baby backs etc...I think the standout were the ribs. VERY good...very tender (but not overcooked), good sauce.  I enjoyed every one.Everything else was just ok. Like on par with Chili's (which isn't saying much). The sides were pretty tasty. Corn (roasted and then taken off the cob for you) , mashed potatoes, cornbread...all pretty good. Dinner for other (other kids, no booze)...50$.But a other star place? Maybe in the context of other restaurants in the Dunlap and I-17 areas (next to crazy Mitch's Furniture barn.) But not in the broader context of PHX.I would definitely go back for ribs...but not a place that will go into the normal rotation.Side note: Hilarious crowd on a Saturday night. Lots of "west side" clubbers...or maybe too old to be clubbers but want to go clubbing (there is a lounge attached).
other I had lunch here today with co workers and it was absolutely delicious! Cannot wait to go back gain.
other Was looking for something refreshing for a nightcap on a hot Scottsdale night. You will not be disappointed. The sorbet was really tasty and refreshing.
other best. grilled. cheese. and. tomato. soup. ever.
3 Similar to Los Betos - Fiesta is decent inexpensive mexican food. The staff is nice and accommodating. I did have a pretty hilarious conversation with the girl at the counter though... I was trying to order my burrito without onions, and she kept saying "okay" and "yes" and nodding at everything I said. I would ask her questions and she would say "yes" and press buttons on the register. It took me a few minutes to realize she had absolutely no idea what I was saying. Aside from that, my burrito wasn't bad... nothing special though. The beans were from a can, the guacamole wasn't fresh (I doubt anything was), everything is cooked in or made of lard, their chips are flavorless and kinda stale, and they are seriously lacking any sort of salsa. They just have the typical generic nameless hot sauce found in these joints. As I said - Los Betos... but cleaner and a little better maybe. It's just a place for convenient late-night munchies.
other This review is specifically for my experience at Trader Vic's last night (a Saturday night) for Happy Hour (4pm - 7pm).My wife and I and two friends had a great time!  We spent the Happy Hour in their outdoor bar area - so cool - which is slightly shaded and very calming.  The apps were tasty, especially for their low, low prices, and my wife really liked her  vodka cocktail on special.  They didn't have any beers on special, but I had a draft Stella anyway.Neither of us cared much for the fried calamari, but it wasn't bad, just not our style.  Everything else - the edamame, mini-burger, and sweet potato fries - was awesome.  Oh, and speaking of awesome, so was the service.  The waitress was friendly and helpful, and the bussers were very attentive!We will be back for Saturday's Happy Hour again soon.
other Typical anglophiles, my lady and I gravitated toward the tea garden. But that doesn't mean we didn't love photographing and learning about the myriad plants that call the desert home.I was particularly enchanted by the century agave and giraffe trees.Give yourself plenty of time to walk the garden's many loops. I would recommend at least four hours.
other Based off of these great reviews i decided to give Z's Greek Restaurant a try. From my experience I give this restaurant an overall four stars derived by their Greek styled atmosphere, great food selection, and customer satisfaction! Z's is a family friendly zone which is good for all ages from kids to adults. There is barely any waiting line plus, the food is dished out quick. Best of all, there is a drive through window which allows easier pickup especially on the go. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who has never experienced Greek food and is willing to taste a different styled recipe from their original comfort zone. Everything is prepared tenderly, juicy, and well seasoned! Give Z's Greek a try!
other Hours of my time have been spent at J Crew.  The sales associates are very helpful, reserving fitting rooms, checking in the back for sizes, even running around the store as you stand unclothed in the dressing room.  Clothes at J Crew are more expensive than your typical store but you are paying for quality clothing.  Many dresses and skirts purchased elsewhere have hit the dust as my J Crew pencil skirts and blouses stand unscathed.  Need shoes to complete the outfit?  Maybe a sparkling accessory?  J Crew has you covered.  Plus, everything can be mixed and matched.  The clothes here fit me like a glove; not only are they stylish and work appropriate.  I feel confident, feminine and professional in these clothes.  Ask for the teacher discount if you're in education!
other I love this place.Their italian beef with hot peppers is a must. I have also tried their sausage and pep sandwich which is just as good.Their prices are as good as you can get. So if you're hungry stop in & get full!!
other My wife and I visited LGO a while back and we were both impressed and enjoyed our meal. The WINGS were by far the best I have ever tasted. Our pizza was great, we had the pepperoni and ricotta. It does get kinda crowded and chaotic on weekend nights. The grocery store in pretty cool but didn't buy anything. Like a previous review, it did feel like a upscale Cracker Barrel. All around a great place to eat. Also, Take a camera so you can take pictures of all the lame hipster clowns that try to make it all about them. They are the only downside to LGO.
other This is the best record store in Tempe, hands down.  Second best in the Valley (after Tracks in Wax).  I have been collecting records for almost 30 years now, and have been going to Eastside for about half that time - at least since I could conveniently drive out to the east valley, and regularly since I moved to this end of town about 10 years ago.  I remember the fish tank with the moray eel and the fact that the plaza they are in used to let them have twice the space.It amazes me that they have survived all this time.  And, boy, am I glad they have.  A good chunk of my collection, and even my current turntable, has come from here.  If I ever won the lottery, I would probably spend enough money in one day here to keep the place in business for another few decades.  Heck, I'd even buy them a bigger place if I could!  This is one of the last truly independent record stores.  I'm happy to support them, and I hope everyone else will continue to do so as well.Edit: They closed down on 12/31/10.  I'm going to miss them.  Hopefully they'll reopen somewhere else, even if it is only online.  My regret is that I didn't have enough money to do one final run through there.
other Of the 3 sites - this is the Kindergarten.My daughter is attending here and I simply love it.  She's five and is repeating kindergarten.  She attended kindergarten last year early at the encouragement of her preschool teachers who thought she was bored in their classes.  We are having her repeat because she's a little young for first grade, but this isn't an issue because the curriculum rolls every two years for that very reason.  In her first year - she learned to read, write, do simple math, know all her sign language letters, and has more Spanish knowledge than I do.  this year they will build upon all of that and take her further.The staff is great and care a lot about the kids.  And when issues arise they  work with the parents to get them solved both at school and at home.It's pricey. But so very worth it.
other Shoes, and purses, and make-up - o my!Your sales totally RAWK guys!  I mean, seriously - 50-70% off (gotta catch it just right, people) and then, an extra 30% off that?!  I feel like a wild thing, you make my heart sing.OK, now today, the most I found was 40% off - B U T - then there's MAC!  Oooooooo, ya baby.  All that glitters is NOT gold.  (ok, it's the small things...)It was still fun to look at all the purses.... And mark some for future reference.  Hey, I am a patient person.... I stop for red - tags, that is.
other So, after finding out I didn't have to be a juror today, I decided to go to Treehouse to celebrate!  I got 1other different cupcakes (intending to share with my husband and friends at work of course!) and wasn't disappointed. I love the caramel chocolate and peanut butter chocolate ones best! The only ingredient I hope Treehouse considers adding is avocado, since it makes vegan cupcakes decadently rich!  One of the sister's who co-owns and is a co-baker was a doll. We both are hoping Phoenix continues to build up a variety of veggie- conscientious, healthy/delicious places to frequent.
other REI.. I love you .. what and who did you hire??!!! BECAUSE you are such a 5star.. you rock.. you have all things for the active.. even for my active doggy! My active everything.. BUT when I drop over $100 on a reflective North Face jacket so Mark doesnt get run over on the run in the dark on his business trips.. & your startofffriendly and turntobeastwhentoldNO workerbee clerk boy checks me out and I deny his REI loyalty club membership.. not once.. not twice.. he asks whats my DEAL? Wait, DID he just ask me whats my DEAL??? (come here college boy.. ILL show you what my deal is!) followed with.. what you dont see yourself shopping here much? I glared at him.. and stated I was in an absolute hurry.. PLEASE give me my paid for merchandise because I SAID NO! My friend said thank you as we left.. and he actually chuckled.. umm no thank you back.. bad bad bad.. but I love the merchandise and the friendly folks in the bike and running area.. so its gotta rate a other for that..
other My mother always told me, if I didn't have anything nice to say, say nothing!
3 I don't usually write reviews very often (in fact ever).  But I felt that the 4.other stars does not currently reflect my previous sushi experience here.  First off, the service here was really good.  The waitress was really nice, very prompt and courteous and provided the food quickly. The food itself, was prepared well, I usually eat a lot of nigiri and the pieces are ok in amount of fish, the rice was packed well and the quality of the fish was good.The major downside in my opinion is that its pricier than I expected.  I wish Yelp would provide "2.other dollar signs".  Granted, I did not come for "Happy Hour" which ends relatively early at 5pm.  I go to a lot of sushi restaurants and for the amount of fish provided, I would have expected it to be cheaper.Also, the edamame cost $$.  Even the miso soup is not complimentary.  Considering the above average price, I've been to too many other places that have the same price, same quality, and provided the necessities for free.  Oh, I even forgot that a bowl of white rice for my child was even a charge.  So, the nickel and dime of things I would have expected compounded with the surprisingly above average price, I can only say that Yen Sushi was "ok".  The other two people in my party (minus the children) also agree.
other Your reviews are hilarious!!   (shoot--who was this referring to??)I try to avoid WM.  I'm always warned about the possibility of TB or now, pig flu.  I think the hub just doesn't want to go shopping--not that I LIKE shopping.I know someone who worked WM in WA and she says the conditions are just horrible for employees.  I've spoken to at least one cashier that is actually FRIENDLY and LOVES his job benefits and bonuses.  He's a minority I guess bc as you all said, YOU CAN'T FIND ANYTHING and CAN'T GET HELP without attitude, usually.  I'm standing there staring at other mgrs, and they just ignore me for a few minutes?  I didn't want to interrupt the conversation, so I waited.  FINALLY, one asks if I need help???  NAAAAAH, I was just admiring your huge body and wondered how long it might take me to look that way.  FOOLS!  On my last visit, a customer said "excuse me" to the 3 employees behind me in the aisle.  I glanced at her and she sighed, rolled her eyes and shook her head as they all ignored her.  I chuckled and acknowledged her frustration.  Then one employee pipes up with "OH, I'm sorry ma'am, can we help you?"  She asks to find an item, the customer thanks them, they say "You're welcome", the customer leaves and they sarcastically continue to each other: "THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR.  NO, THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE HERE.  We're not here to find stuff for stupid people, we have better things to do."    That's why, when I walk by an employee working, if they lay eyes on me, they immediately look away and pretend to be engrossed in their job, to avoid stopping to help.  WT?  What's wrong w/this management???  I agree, you can find some deals and save some money, but the attitude is over the top.  There are a FEW employees that actually smile and appear friendly, at least when I see them, and I can point them out.  If not for the more often than not occurences as mentioned above, I stay OUT of WM as much as possible, which is a lot.  I've drastically reduced my trips there, but more importantly, I've cut out a huge chunk of purchasing from WM.
other This Target gets the job done. Their shelves tend to be in a little disarray, and their makeup selections are generally lacking, but other than superfluous purchases I didn't even need to make, this Target has never let me down.The grocery section is probably the cleanest and best in the store. I love perusing these aisles.Their clothing section is pretty diverse, but because the store is somewhat small, it's packed in tight. It's a challenge to maneuver the area.The biggest perk is its central location to southern Tempe. It's also very rarely busy during the day, which is awesome!
3 This was the first and only Thai place I've been to in AZ.  Overall, it is pretty good.  I think we will probably try a new place next time but if we can't find anything better, I think we won't have any problem going back to Swaddee.*Price = on the high-end *Pad Thai = pretty good volume*Green Curry = very good.*Garlic delight = The portion is way too small to charge $11
other We eat dinner here often, usually with exemplary service and delicious food.  If you get seated in Tanya's section, ask to be moved immediately!  She was nice, but a terrible waitress.
other Wings + Beer + Football = LOVEI am such a girly girl 99% of the time but come fall, I sort of turn into a dude.....This is not my most favorite place to catch the game, but a good alternative when I want to mix it up or my team is on a bye week. Good selection of boneless wing flavors.Oh god, just writing this makes me yearn for the season to begin!!!!!!!!!!!
other I'd been hearing about Defalco's for a while now. My husband, Jim W, and my youngest, Abby, raved. "Best steak grinda since Baston," they said. So, on an expedition to get more raw chocolate, we went.The first thing I noticed was that the tables were scattered among the racks of Italian foodstuffs. I loved that. The place screamed "Boston" from the moment we walked in the door. When we ordered, Jim found one of my favorite types of soda in the case, Doc Brown's diet black cherry. I was in heaven.So we got our number and sat down. While we were waiting - a short wait - I got a brilliant idea which solved a long-vexing problem. Guess it was the east coast vibe.The food came and I was in heaven. We split a steak sandwich and red potato salad. Jim likes everything and I just like onions so they gave him the mushrooms and peppers on the side. Lots of mushrooms and peppers. It didn't look like a ton of food but we certainly got enough to eat.What's not to like at Defalco's? The food is fabulous, the prices are good, the people are really nice, and they have all kinds of imported goodies. So I guess the only thing I didn't like about Defalco's was leaving.
other UMMMMMMMM...can I just say that this place needs to get more action!  The pizzas here are FANTASTIC!!  I discovered this place because it opened above SACKS.  It is around the corner from my house and I am so thankful it is.  The whole restaurant is open...I wish it had a little more space, but that is ok.  First, the Tuscan Pie is to die for!!  It has prosciutto, Gorgonzola, apple, arugula, a fig marmalade and balsalmic vingerette reduction sauce drizzled on top...at least I think that is what it is...I need to check the menu...but anyways its FABULOUS!!!  I wish I could eat it everyday!  I tried their Moroccan Pizza before they took it off the menu and it was awesome too!  Every single salad is great and the wine and beer selection is great too!  The staff is so nice and friendly.  I get this to go all the time and bring it home...and I have shared this with my friends too.  I love good Italian pizza and its great!
other Got a great deal from Home run.com and used it to find some good cigars.Staff is friendly and very knowledgeable.
other The Vig is a great place to meet up for a drink. I haven't found too many other places that serve Hoegaarden (my favorite beer). The atmosphere is one of the best I've seen in Phoenix, and the food is pretty good as well. I'd recommend the "Big Azz Burger" or the "Hot Vings"!
other Over-priced, over-salted and thoroughly unimaginative. Package those adjectives up in a pretty little nutshell and you've got Arcadia Tavern. Arcadia Tavern is a family-friendly, bland and inoffensive, if not overpriced, alternative to Applebee's or TGI Friday's. I was seriously enthused when a tavern opened up within a five minute walk of my house. I like drinking and I like walking. Combine the two and you get stumbling, which can also have its high points, ripped jeans notwithstanding. But Arcadia Tavern is no tavern. No self-respecting tavern can commit the cardinal sins of happy hour and retain their integrity.Cardinal rule #1: Thou shalt not end happy hour before 7 pm. Seriously. What is it with places trying to redefine Happy Hour as the hours between 3 and 6 pm? I understand that from a price point perspective the 3-other or 4-other pm hours are much cheaper than extending food and drink discounts to the 6-7 pm crowd. But I consider that the same as shining up a turd and calling it a custom made gift. Ooo, you offer three hours of happiness? Pity I can only make 1other minutes of it. Bottom line is other pm's whistle blowing time, gridlock makes a girl crave a drink and 6-7 pm is the prime hour for getting that drink on. To end happy hour before 7pm pretty much guarantees happy hour barflies will not frequent the establishment.Flipside: Three dollar Dos Equis, all day, every day. At least there's that.Cardinal rule #2: Thou shalt offer more than frozen food and canned items as appetizers, and if offering cheap frozen crap, it shall be reflected in the price. Fries, tater tots, onion rings, wings, mozzarella sticks, chicken strips, and the ubiquitous spinach and artichoke dip? Whoa. Don't strain yourself, TGI Friday's. My main gripe is with the monster nachos. Maybe I'm just taking crazy pills, but the chips, seasoned shredded chicken and nacho cheese were all wicked salty. We're talking mouth-puckering, tastebud-slaughtering salt laden nachos topped with canned pickled jalapenos (gross), black olives (more salt) and black beans (respect).  I'm also biased against the unnatural plastic consistency of nacho cheese. It makes everything soggy and is a tacky substitute for the real deal. Cheese should crisp up around the edges and pull apart in delectable strings, not ooze sadly over a mass of chips and overpower everything else on the plate. I will say that the guacamole and pico de gallo that topped the nachos were delicious, tasted homemade and were a saving grace, but they were also woefully underrepresented compared to the macnasty nacho sauce. Flipside: The three mini sliders (albeit meager) and grilled veggies platter with hummus showed promise. Cardinal rule #3: Thou shalt provide affordable drink and nosh.So what's that nacho monstrosity going to run you? Twelve bucks. Don't blink. You read right. Twelve dollars for salty garbage. Mozzarella sticks? 7. Dozen wings? 9! Completely unrealistic. Shave a couple bucks off each appetizer and you're in the reasonable price zone, particularly considering the cheap tasting ingredients. Taking that first impression into account, I don't think I'm going to shell out 10-1other dollars for a hamburger (without fries) when I could go to Delux and have my socks blown off with flavor for cheaper or to the Chicago Hamburger Co. for pennies in comparison. Flipside: There is no positive here. For the caliber of food offered, the prices are completely unrealistic. Even the desserts are overpriced. Six bucks for a root beer float? That's a big middle finger right there.Arcadia Tavern, as a representative of the Happy Hour enforcement squad, I hereby declare you undeserving of your title. Four Peaks is a tavern. The Vine is a tavern. Icehouse is a tavern. Hell, even Carlsbad Tavern does it better and they have plastic bats hanging from the ceiling. I regret that I shall never again spend a happy hour in your warm embrace. Although you may still win me over with $3 you-call-its on Thursday after 9 pm. Particularly when accompanied by a little goldfish racing. I totally hate goldfish, too. At least share that in common.
3 A nice place to watch a game... nice that it is open enough that you can keep an eye on the game while you survey your many dining alternatives.I also they let some natural sunlight and keep the place cool at the same time.Anyway I don't have a good reason to give this place one star, or five stars, hence three stars.
other Handmade, in-store fine candies aand chocolates are awesome (way better than See's, but higher priced).  The owners are really great people!
3 Been closed for a long time.
other Hate is such a strong word.. I try not to use when I its not really called for. When I set out to Yelp the Safeway across the street from me and the Mr.'s place I thought of using that word to describe how much I don't like this Safeway.  Of course it's warranted, they pissed me off!Okay you know how they always do BOGOF on milk.. well me and the Mr don't drink that much milk so the cashier usually just gives me half off the other gallon. Well this time she forgot to and I didn't notice until I got home.. so seeing that I used to shop here once a week I figured Id just bring my receipt back the following week. Well the following week I went in and showed the receipt and the dumb bitch behind the counter was like, 'what am I supposed to do about it?'.. I explained to her what usually happens as the cashier gives it to me for half off.. she then proceeded to ask me which cashier was doing that, 'it's not our policy.'After going back and forth for a few minutes I finally just told her to give me my other bucks.. she told me if I would have brought them the receipt back the same day they would have done something about it. Are you f-ing kidding me? Whats the difference besides my being inconvenienced having to drive back there. So I finally asked her if she was willing to lose a potential lifetime customer over other bucks? She responded, 'there's nothing I can do for you.' I then told her that her customer service skills suck and that I will NEVER return to the store. I guess never say never since I went into my very much disliked Safeway the other day. Believe it or not they make a pretty damn good sandwich and I despise Subway. So the other stars are for the yummy sandwich and the super cute guy who made it! So much for my convictions?!
3 Sometimes you just want to give an A for effort...Or maybe more than three lame stars.  As the two other previous reviewers have pointed out succinctly, the man who I assume to be the owner was extremely nice.  I made the 1.other hour drive from Tucson to watch Avatar at Arizona Mills, and my friends and I decided to grab a bite before heading back.  We randomly drove down Baseline and pretty much stumbled upon this place.  Traffic going westbound towards the 10 was insane.  I mean it was bumper to bumper past Rural.  Anyway, I ask the guy who I assume is the owner why the traffic was so bad.  At first he didn't know, but then realized that the 60 was closed.  He politely recommended that we head south then cut across to get back to the 10.  I ordered the Jerusalem Falafel sandwich. It was pretty good.  Though, in all honesty, falafel is not one those kind of dishes that one can gush over.  In my opinion, it's pretty hard to mess up deep frying ground chickpeas.  I ought to point out that the ingredients were very fresh.  This also applied to the side salad that comes with the combo meal.  My two friends opted for the gyros, and it looked good.  The meat was thinly sliced, which is somewhat different than others I've had.  They seemed to enjoy the meal, but I don't think they were quite overwhelmed by it either.  In fact, we didn't mention anything about the food during the hour and a half trip back home.  The food is by no means bad at Pita Shack.  It's adequate to serviceable in terms of Mediterranean food.  The positives regarding the food have to be its freshness and price.  In fact, I spent no more than $8 for a sandwich, salad, and drink.  The service, as noted previously, is undoubtedly the most shining spot of the place.   As we were finishing up our meal, the guy who I assume is the owner offered us lentil soup on the house.  We declined after being quite filled and satisfied from our respective sandwiches.  I believe another reviewer had the same thing happen to him, and he had positive comments about it.  Now, for me it's was the food that really matters.  Accordingly, I gave three stars, as opposed to the four that I was close to giving.  Should I ever return to the Tempe area hankering for food in a pita, I would most definitely give Pita Shack another shot; if only to support a genuinely nice guy's business.
other LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The food was amazing,who cares if it's  chain restaurant.      We had tried to go the night before but they were packd so we made a reservation for the next night.It was really busy when we go there but we were seated immediately.Our server was really nice and very helpful when we told him we had never been there before.           We ordered the fried alligator app,and loved every bite of it.I had the filet mignon and rock lobster tail.The steak was cooked perfectly and was a good size for the price.I'm not usually a huge fan of lobster but wanted to give it a try,Pappadeux has changed my opinion about lobster,the meat  came right out of the tail.It was buttery andjust plain yummy! It was the first chance hubby and I really had a chance to go out to eat without the kids,so we really wanted to make the most of our time.And we wre definetly able to do that here.Refills kept coming even after we had paid the bill.I also loved the live music from the jazz quartet making its way around the room.The only thing thats keeping me from giving it other stars is that the tables were too close to each other,and it was so loud I could hear the discussion at the table next to me but I had a hard time hearing my huband across the table.I will definetly be going back to Pappadeux over and over again.
other Great, challenging course.  Well maintained. Friendly staff, marshalls, etc."Club House" is still a pretty-fied construction trailer, but they now have supplies, clubs, balls etc. available.The view alone is worth the round.  Unfortunately, porta-potties are only at the practise tees, holes other and 13, so it isn't so lady-friendly.The bar cart does make its way around, however and you are given bottled water in your cart.
other Had a very delightful meal here the other day.I benchmark all Chinese restaurants by their potstickers.  These were delicious and not deep fried.  They were more toasted than anything.The mongolian beef was delicious.  Good quality, nice spicy flavor.
other I was not a believer, but one of my friends said I would not be disappointed so I gave it a shot  Happy Hour in the bar is $other a person per section ($other cheese, $other chocolate, $4, salad, and drink specials as well).  I was super surprised, it was all really good of course, and I was FULL!!!  Also, you can have more bread and dessert for free if you have and of your cheesy or chocolatey goodness left!  Took a lot of time, I think we were there for like other hours but I would do it again.
3 other star service other star food = 3 stars.The bfast potatoes were undercooked and obviously microwaved, not grilled.The bacon was just OK.The prices are HIGH, both for the menu & the grocery.Wi-fi is unreliable.  When it goes out, it takes them 15-20 min to reset it.Great friendly service.  Nice, sunny outdoor seating.
other Best selection of raw and dehydrated food around.  Very helpful personnel, friendly.  Will shop here each time I vacation here with my dog.
other This restaurant = a great experience. Everything about this place is fabulous. The server was extremely attentive, the food was fresh and delicious, and the intimate yet casual ambiance is to die for.ENTREEFor starters, they do put a rather unique spin on the typical 'chips and salsa' that's brought out to you in the beginning of most Spanish restaurants. They bake corn tortillas until their crisp and serve that with an interesting array of dips: black bean, salsa, and a tray of salt, limes, and hot sauce to stir in.I ordered a simple entree of carne asada tacos and black beans; my meal was yummy and filling, and I even had leftovers. Beware of spicy when choosing your dish, however. My coworker kept complaining about how hot her meal was (beer battered fish burrito). I don't know if she has sensitive taste buds, or if it was really spicy.. so proceed with caution.DESSERTThey have a wide variety of entrees, but unfortunately only have 3 sweet options. I'm a BIG dessert person, so it was a little disappointing but what the heck. I ordered the flan and it was scrumptious, incredible, delectable, etc.. all that good stuff. My coworker who complained about the spiciness called our dessert 'sexy'. So I guess sexy is the best way to describe it's caramel drizzle and chocolate bark yumminess.AMBIANCE/SERVICEThe waiter was incredibly attentive and friendly. He answered all questions we had, and gave speedy and praiseworthy service. The manager even came up to our table and made conversation; that, to me, is always a plus. The background music helped add to the overall appeal to the restaurant. I would definitely go back to SOL. Maybe tomorrow..
other I'd say I've been to the Clubhouse a few times a year over the past five years or so. Does that make me the most knowledgeable person on the venue? By all means, no. But, there are some very common themes among the shows I've seen here, even though the artists were different genres, different, crowds, and even different times of year. The sound quality is terrible. The last three bands that I have seen there (and have seen in other venues as well) all complained that they couldn't get the sound right on their monitors or in the house. To me, that's a major turn off, if the band isn't happy with their sound, are they going to be very motivated to play? Maybe it's a slighted observation, but it seems that the only bands that return to this venue, are the ones that play music, where the sound quality isn't...let's say "sacrificed or as important" (metal, hardcore, thrasher, hip-hop, whatever you call it). The venue is also hot. I don't read the reviews of others, before I review a location, because I don't want my opinions to be skewed, but I noticed someone said, "don't wear pants," honestly, that's a really good tip. The last show I saw here was in June. I know, it's Phoenix, in the summer, suck it up. But when you exit the venue and it is noticeably and significantly "cooler" than inside the venue, we've got issues, can they not afford to run the a/c? The answer to that question is, maybe not. The bar is understaffed, and patrons seem to be lined up 3+ deep, all around. Sometimes you've got to spend money to make money. Hire more bartenders, customers get served faster, thus allowing them more time to consume the beverage and purchase more. That means you can sell more, which means you will make more money! What a concept. Hate to just destroy a business, but hopefully they will heed the feedback constructively. Until then, remember: if you've always wanted to hear the artist you are going to see in a low-fi format, here's your chance, if you have always wanted to forgo wearing those pantaloons, I support you, and finally, you should craft a clever way to hide a flask, since you won't get served, although this might be difficult sans bottoms.
other what a great place. there were other of us and we all have something different. the ribs just melted off the bones. my wife had the filet and it just melted in your mouth. she had the special mashed potatoes, don't remember what they were called but she really enjoyed them.another party had salmon and it looked great. the son from OR had the meat loaf and it really left a lot to be desired. sort of dry and not much taste. The B other drinks were good  and near the hi end of pricing,but hey its Scottsdale. This was our first visit and it will not be our last. Just a long drive from Surprise. don't forget the corn bread and request butter. A great meal would be a large salad and the corn bread.
other The castle is what drew us here.  It's just the front of a castle with a reading nook in the bottom of the tower.  The 3 year old was impressed as soon as he saw it.  There is also a play area with big activity walls.  It was a little hard for my son to comprehend being quiet while playing.  Getting to the library was confusing with the GPS.  Just follow the signs and park in the garage at the end to the left when you pull in.  Well worth a one time visit.
other Roads are goodService not so goodThis place is a tourist trap in every sense of the word. The restaurant and gift shop are overpriced for what you get and the ice cream isn't anything special. Service from the staff needs to be a lot better and treat the customers like you want them there. Always understaffed always waiting on food. Been there a half dozen time no improvement.Do come to the area for the beautiful views, not for the food or souvenirs. Great road for motorcycles ride.During the summer outdoor cooking.
other Review #800  I had to wait for a great place to feature for #800.  Enter: Parent morning movies... in a theater that offers changing tables and dim lights in addition to their ultra nice seating, VIP rooms, 21+ beverages, good food service, incredibly friendly staff, and caramel popcorn.  I'm in!!  Oh, and did I mention it's a beautiful, clean theater, too?WHO: All mommies, daddies, and other care-giversWHAT:  Go see a movie with your lil one!WHEN: Wednesday mornings and occasional featured nights. WHERE:  Listings for participating Ultra Star theaters are here... http://www.ultrastarmovies.com/parent_movie_morning.aspHOW: Because Ultra Star theater is AWESOME.WHY:  Because you deserve to get out and enjoy a movie... bonus that it's a movie with Early-Bird prices of $5.75!I wanna give a shout-out to the management, staff and... whoever thought of parent movie mornings to begin with.  It was nice to get out of the house with my lil one, to do something that I used to take for granted when I wasn't a parent. haha  And then to get there and have the theater so nicely set-up, complete with changing tables and dim lights... well that was amazing.  All of the care-givers there were relaxed, happy and able to enjoy a movie without worrying about missing a part if their lil one fussed.  We all had nothing but praises for your kid-friendly attitude and made plans to meet often.  Thank-you Ultra Star Cinema for a new, great experience.  It's been a while since a place surprised me so much (in a good way)!  See ya there!
other So your going to Scottsdale via Paradise Valley....or your coming from Scottsdale heading east....your stomach is growling but you don't want the usual...then look no further than Jason's Deli. I was in that situation on Friday night and decided to give this locale a try....and I must say I was not disappointed. I had the Smokey Jack Panini with Smoked turkey breast....guacamole....provolone cheese....lettuce...tomato....bacon on the side which I gave to my wife....LOL...since I don't eat red meat....and Russian dressing. However sandwich was made to order and pressed perfectly on the grill....and the flavor was outstanding. They give you a pickle and homemade potato chips on the side....and I also had some lemonade which comes from a fountain with free refills. I almost missed out on the free Ice Cream....but I seen people walking around with cones of Ice Cream and I had my wife ask was it free. Indeed it was and we both enjoyed a nice Ice Cream cone....mine was chocolate vanilla swirl...and you can also get it in a cup as well. The service was great and the whole place had a real nice neighborhood feel to it.....I look forward to returning here very soon. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!
other I am always in search of good food fast...not fast food! I think Jimmy John's knows what they are doing, and should continue to knock out those sandwiches, FAST.I love that I can pretty much know, I will a) Not wait in line and b) be in and out in other to other minutes flat! Heck yeah! And get a very tasty filling sub.I recommend the Lulu, it is very good, and has tons of meat.Oh, don't waste your hard earned money on the Avocado. This is my only complaint about Jimmy John's, they have pureed avocado and just spread it on like it is mayo, only they don't put much on. I think it is a waste of money.This is my go to lunch place when I am in a hurry!
other Place is alright but for the waitress, poor service and things sent over we didn't order.  We sent them back but had  additional items brought and not brought on the tab anyway.  She said me "that couldn't happen" and refused to take it off. Waitress included autograt. I have been here a dozen times and never get great service but enjoy myself.  This time will be my last.
other I recently tried OHSO. Nice layout and design... modern and casual. Their menu features cheese and charcuterie plates, flatbreads, burgers, and other comfort-style dishes. I had the grilled cheese with a cup of tomato soup. The tomato soup reminded me of pepperoni pizza, which was strange at first but actually pretty good. It was the perfect order for a chilly, rainy day. The 48th Street Fizz (orange vodka, pineapple, lemon, st. germaine, and beer) was sweet, but tasty (love cocktails with carbonation). They have an extensive list of local and regional beers. Overall, it's a nice little neighborhood spot.
other I purchased the Enotria groupon when it was released last year and had a horrible experience at the restaurant.1) I ordered a cheese platter. The platter was very much overpriced at over $18.00. The most problematic thing is that Enotria ordered the food from another restaurant on Mayo Blvd and had it delivered to them. The same is true with Pizza. If you order pizza there, it will be delivered from another restaurant in the Mayo shopping plaza. Enotria is taking a significant markup on the food because they are paying another vendor for it. AVOID THIS!!2) Another disturbing aspect of the visit was that we were served disproportionately small portion because we were using a groupon. We ordered two glasses of red wine. The waiter (who also happened to be the owner) served us a glass that was 1/3 of what is typically served.The only positive aspect of Enotria is that they have a good selection of wines. To be sincere, you are much better off going to a more reputable establishment in the area like White Chocolate Grill.Oh, also keep in mind that the current owner bought the restaurant over a year ago. It has changed ownership several times and the overall quality is suffering because of this.AVOID.
other Ive been eating here more and more often lately, and I like the food.  If I want Mexican food, and I am in the downtown chandler area, this is where I stop in.The food quality is consistent.  Being a creature of habit, I get the same thing every time I come here.They are also serving cupcakes.  Looks like the change the flavor every once in a while too.  I have had a margarita flavored one, and a dark chocolate and chili one.  Tasty.
3 Eh, this place is okay.  I was not super impressed.  The food was okay.  I was not blown away.   After being seated, we sat at the table for a good 1other minutes without anyone noticing that no one had been to our table once.  We had to flag down a server.  Once we actually did have a server, the service was good.  I can forgive the glitch.  Everyone has a bad night.  But the food just lacked the wow factor.  Even though I have a twenty dollar gift certificate (to make up for the initial service issue) I have not been back.  I guess that about sums it up.
3 For some reason this reminds me a bit of Dukes in Waikiki. Food is OK, not bad, not good either. Service is OK, not bad, not good. The best part about this place is that they don't have a cover and its easy to get into. Its good for a beer on a pub crawl or to sober up for a couple of hours bother 2am. One of my coworkers literally drops $100's here per week and I don't think hes ever gotten a free beer. I think that says something about the place.
other 3 months, 2other emails, 10 plus calls and (I think) we have the final refund from Budget! Stay clear of Budget Rental they DO NOT care about customers or resolving their monumental mistakes!
other Beautiful little gem of a restaurant.  Great outdoor seating, amazing-truly amazing mussels.  Wholeheartedly recommend, perfect "date night" too.
other Let's see great coffee....great muffins....good service....coffee drinks need some work though. D&D never lets me down when it comes to plain ole american coffee....but there attempts at making coffee drinks to compete with Starbucks and even Mcdonald's for that matter come up lame. I tried for example the frozen hot chocolate the other day....taste like plain ole chocolate milk with whip cream. The coolatta's and other frozen drinks are not bad but Starbucks is much better.However with all that being said....no one makes a better cup of coffee.......... by fast food standards anyway..... than does D&D. The coupons I get every couple of weeks also rock because I can get that great coffee cake muffin they make for 99 cents. I also get get coupons for 1.00  off combos.....free doughnuts....and even 99 cent for large coffee's (although I never have that size...LOL). So if your looking for great coffee and maybe  a cheap breakfast to go along with it give D&D a try and remember to Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!
other I stumbled across this place after missing my usual Light Rail stop on my way to pick up a Zipcar at the downtown ASU campus.First I tried my usual caffeine fix...a nonfat double latte. Excellent.Second trip back, I gave the breakfast burrito (plus bacon) a try. Delicious. The tortilla was as good as everything inside.Third trip, a beet salad and a bacon chocolate chip cookie. Bacon and chocolate for the win!I've been here three times and have not been disappointed. The decor is modest, but functional, as it should be at a good business with honestly good food. The barista is not only knowledgable and skilled, but is also a genuine sweetheart.It's just a couple of blocks from the Jefferson and First Street Light Rail stop (East bound), so I've been stopping by on my way to work.
other Do not get your oil changed at this walmart or any walmart. We got a oil change and they dented our oil pan and now it leaks and they are not taking responsibility for the damages they caused. I have only had my oil changed for the last year here and they are trying to put it off on someone else, when no one else has clearly done our oil. The insurance for walmart wont even look at my vehicle and had already decided they are not at fault. I had a 3rd party appraiser look at it and they can only determine it was from an oil change. I have no other option but to take this to a lawyer.
other Fez completely deserves five stars but as a pescatarian (vegetarian plus fish, as much as I hate labeling how I eat) I had very limited options. My husband and I ate here on a rare trip to downtown Phoenix.  The burgers sounded mouthwatering but unfortunately there wasn't a veggie burger substitute.  Many restaurants offer this and I really had my heart set on a sandwich. My husband ordered the Fez burger, a delectable combo of honey molasses BBQ, spiced pears, and lemon garlic aoli.  I was fairly jealous but my shrimp kisra (flat bread pizza) was obscenely good with lobster sauce, wilted spinach and parmesan cheese. We also split an order of garlic rosemary fries, which were delicious. I wish we would have saved room for dessert as the portions were huge and really two much for us to eat! Normally I take my leftovers to go but since we were out for several hours I didn't want to leave anything to waste. I'd definitely come back to Fez but I won't be putting it into regular rotation due to the lack of veggie friendly sandwiches and entrees.
3 I really didn't think this place was all that great.  None of the food that I ate was particularly very good.  I think the best thing I had were some sort of sweet and sour meatball things.  Everything was just hard, overcooked, or flavorless.  I wasn't really impressed with the options available either.The saving grace of this place is the BBQ station and the sushi bar.  The bbq looked 1000 times better than YC's Mongolian freeze-dried junk.  The sushi was decent too.  This place is just middle of the road for me.  I can't blame it for having over-cooked food...it's a buffet.  But still, I've had better.
other As far as salon-cafes go, this has got to be one of the better ones.  The sandwiches, while not particularly ground breaking, are thoughtful and assembled with quality components.  Also has a pretty good old-town ambiance.
other I really love this gym. It is so nice and well maintained. There is always plenty of towels to grab before a workout.  The childcare is excellent and has the security part down. When you sign up as a member you and your child are given assigned wristbands to use during visits. The staff have always been good about ensuring the numbers on them match prior to releasing my child to me. You can even tune into the cameras to watch your child on the tv's that are on the cardio equipment. Childcare is also open 7 days a week and doesnt close for lunch like most gyms. There is also plenty of group classes throughout the day if you are into Zumba or cycling,etc. I recommend this gym to anyone especially parents needing quality childcare.
other I was not a particular fan of this place. Went on a Friday evening after work. A friend wanted to try it because we always enjoy supporting new, local places.They do have a very large selections of beer but the process is very confusing. All of the beers on tap are written on a very large chalkboard above the bar. They use several different colors of chalk for each selection making it very hard to read. It may be easier if they pick one color of chalk for each type of beer, that way it is easy to find what you want. Or have #1-other be one type of beer, #6-10 another and so on. My boyfriend spent so long trying to find a beer on the board because of this. Two of our friends were so overwhelmed with the way the selections were presented they just asked the server to surprise them with a choice. The acoustics in the place are terrible. It was so loud inside that it was hard to carry on a conversation at the table. Also, no happy hour. This would be a great way to draw in an after work crowd.
other I love love LOVE this place. My boss (who is into healthy eating) recommended this place. I went over with some highly skeptical friends and one dinner was enough to convert them into believers! The food here is so good! We had the Shrimp dumplings and the Onion tart as starters. We ordered the Shirataki noodles and street tacos as entrees. So also ordered the Kale-aid. All of the dishes were yummy. I have gone back many times since then and have never been disappointed! I have gone after yoga to get some Kale salad or the chicken chopped salad. I always have to get the Kale aid. Once, a guy at the next table, uprooted a whole plant by mistake (on the patio) and was highly embarrassed as was his date! Ever since, I have very careful not to throw my arms around as I can be quite clumsy sometimes! I do NOT want to be banned from my favorite place for my clumsiness! I don't think I can live without True Food!
other Over the last 3 years we've lived in the area, this place has changed other times.  First Uncle Bear's, then Tio Oso's, then Thirsty Cactus (or Thirsty Cantina, whatever, it sucked), and now it's TC's Pub & Grub.  The menu is typical bar food, including burgers, sandwiches, pizza, wings as well as some taco and quesadilla selections (which I always appreciate a good quesadilla so I will have to try it next time). The restaurant section (which was always dead before) has now been opened up and TVs added so the whole place is more of a bar feel (thumbs up).  The place was packed for Thursday night football (Cardinal's game!), but still got a good table close to a TV.  Server (who admitted multiple times he was brand new) was very friendly but had to keep asking other servers for clarification on menu, etc.  Still, nice enough and very attentive.We ordered wings ("medium" but they were spicy!) and their "ugly" crust pizza with mushrooms and olives.  The wings, very good, I would get them again.  Pizza, I wouldn't order it again if someone paid me.  The "ugly" crust basically is a thick hand tossed crust - too much crust (and half of it was burned) and very skimpy on the toppings.  It was pretty horrible honestly.  The actual toppings (although sparse) were very tasty... good cheese and fresh mushrooms and olives, so I would order pizza here again IF they have a thinner crust option.  Otherwise, if you are coming here to carb load and really need your bread fix, by all means, order the pizza.  I personally prefer a thinner NY style crust.All in all I would come here again based on the good wings and service, and I'm looking forward to trying their other menu options. p.s. text TCSPUB to 411247 and they'll send you a text coupon for a 50 cent draft. Score! (I'm a sucker for a deal)  Cheers!
other My name is Amy and I'm a comedian.  ("Hi, AMY!")  I perform here about once a month and it's one of my favorite spots to make people laugh.This is a bar.  Behind an ice rink.  The wall behind the bar is the plexiglass of the ice rink.  One time, while I was on stage, a puck hit the glass.  Freaked me the you-know-what out.  I thought I'd been shot.  But I hadn't.  Lucky for you.I don't drink, so I have no idea about specials, what's on tap, blah blah blah.I can tell you this:  The service is amazing (and CUTE!) and the place is clean.  I judge.  I judge you on your bathroom.  This bathroom is clean.  The comedy show is every Wednesday night.  It's free.  If you're lucky, you'll see me there.  Making people laugh.
other EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE! Even with Happy Hour in full swing and the place full of parched Winkies, the service at our large table was spot on. We barely had time to settle our bums and push the silver out to claim our table territory before iced H20 was before us, our drink orders were taken . . . and one quick blink of the eye and the "peacemakers" were before us!  Now that's what I call HAPPY HOUR!Bravo Thirsty Lion!
other Great bar, great atmosphere, great service!Citizen crafts classic old-school cocktails courtesy of Thomas and Rich.  ON top of that they have a few beers on draught, by the bottle and a pleasantly surprising wine selection.   Food-wise the menu is kinda geared towards comfort and southern style offerings including mac-n-cheese, scallops with bacon and corn grits, dungeness crab cakes with complementary slaw, pork-belly, etcAgain, overall good place to go for a casual and relaxing drink or two. Will be back for more...
other Adorable bungalow building: CheckQuirky, cute, mismatched thrift-store dishware: CheckDelicious, buttery, flaky croissant breakfast sandwich: CheckSuper friendly staff: CheckI went here for the first time yesterday and thought it was great. My friend and I both ordered the croissant breakfast sandwich which was super delicious and filling. Even though I knew that I'd be full from the sandwich, I couldn't resist snagging a brown butter scone when I saw it was the last one. Definitely made the right decision on that one, I'm a sucker for brown butter anything and the scone didn't disappoint. My friend ordered the Iced Toddy which was really good-- spiced but mellow. I ordered a latte and didn't like it quite as much. The owner was super friendly and remembered my name for the 1.5+ hrs. my friend and I lingered in the shop. He even gave me a (delicious) orange-zest filled strawberry muffin on the way out! If I didn't live so far away, I would be here all the time. As it is, I'll definitely be back soon.
other Great little hole in the wall with authentic New Mexican food.  Chili Relleno was awesome, and the red and green chile was flavorful and spicy.  Rice and beans were good and the sopapilla was delicious. Atmosphere was cozy.  If you want real red and green chile vs. sauce this is the place.
other Great Korean Kalbi and other table top meats.rest of the dishes wasn't that impressive .Weekend could be really busy you might need to wait for a while to get your food.but weekdays pretty slow.If you like Korean BBQ, this is the best place in chandler ,gilbert area.
other Prices are good nobody is down your throat when you enter and its the best place for produce in town literally would suggest this place over trader joe's for sure
other We've been going here for years. Love the food (Happy Family is a favorite dish) and appreciate the community service outreach. Great to support locals who support the community ... and dish up great food along the way.
other Was dragged back here for the first time in a few years. It still sucks. On a Friday night, it's like 5:other dude to girl ratio. Mill Cue Club is probably fine during the day if you actually want to shoot pool. But if you want to see America's future losers, stop in here after sundown.
other Surprise!  A Vietnamese restaurant in Surprise.  I ordered bun noodles with beef/lemongrass to go.  I waited at the bar, and the service was great.  The owner sat next to me and had a plate of spring rolls.  I made a comment on how tasty they looked, and he asked if I wanted one.  I think that's when I knew I loved this place.  Anyhow, I got home and tasted my food.  Awesome.  The noodles were cooked perfectly (not soggy), and there were plenty of veggies and meat.  The nuoc mam had a lot of flavor as well. (You can have really good food, but if you have crappy nuoc mam, your food won't taste right.)  I think I'm gonna have to start ordering to-go weekly.
3 Absolutely the best sushi in the valley, hands down.  The fish is fresh and their spicy tuna is like no other.  However, the service is extremely slow. We once waited 7other minutes to get our lunch and the restaurant wasn't even full.  Can't say much about the cooked food though, but the sushi is amazing.
3 All I'm saying is they need to do a better job at hiring their staff. The girl that helped us out last time was on something pretty heavy. It was a school night, and we had just finished up dinner next door at Windsor. We all wanted to get something sweet, but the girl working there was so blitzed out of her mind on something. She was barely able to interact with us. Within the first other minutes she must have asked us other times how we were doing. She never once made eye contact.  I'm not exaggerating by saying she looked pretty filthy, and was really rude to boot. Maybe that's just how the poor girl is, but damn, you think they could do a better job hiring people to compliment the charm of a family oriented cutesy sweet spot. She turned us off so bad, that no one in the party decided to order anything.I give it 3 stars because I've been before, and thought their stuff  was good, not great. Churn is pretty damn adorable & local, so they get extra love for that. So, for now, until something better comes along it will just have to do.
other Need fig preserves? They've got it. Fennel? It's beautifully packed on ice and extremely fresh in the produce department. Need boneless pork loin roast from the blade end? The butcher has your back. Duck fat? Just take a peek in the freezer section. Sometimes, it's the little things that normally go unnoticed that gets you five stars...AJ's closed early the other night in lieu of the holidays and I ran around to FOUR different stores looking for something as simple as whole grain mustard and fennel. I came up empty handed on both items. I say "simple" items - but it's amazing when you rely on a grocer like this as much as I do and realize that most items are out of reach otherwise. AJ's carries practically anything my culinary desires could ask for!Although I had to wait a day to go shopping again and to make the recipe i was wanted, it was during my adventures to the other stores that I realized how much I truly appreciate this grocer. How is it I can get wireless internet via laptop on the I-10 freeway courtesy of my phone company, but can't find fennel within a 10 mile radius?This my friends, is why I love AJ's. And as someone who watches America's Test Kitchen as though it were food porn, I can say that any other grocer doesn't stand a chance against Eddie Bashas' high end store.You truly do get what you pay for. For all the employees at AJ's I say "THANK YOU!!" for the great service you provide and the products you offer.
other Foodie from Cali here on business. Nicely done dishes with authentic flavor. Ling Shrimp to die for - at ridiculous bargain prices. other stars if they expand menu. Very nice family setting.
other Eh.... 2.other stars, maybe? 3? Not sure, yet.After looking at the menu online, I really wanted to like this place. The menu has some creativity to it, unlike the template-North-Indian-restaurant-menus you find at many of the Indian restaurants in the Valley. Aside from offering things like korma, kadai, vindaloo, etc. with a variety of options (chicken, lamb, paneer, shrimp or fish for each) they also have some other more unusual choices, like one of my favorite dishes, mattar malai methi (creamy fenugreek and peas). And dahi vada in the appetizers... I couldn't wait to check it out.Unfortunately, three friends and I went at lunchtime on a Saturday - and there was a buffet. So I didn't get to try any of those tempting dishes.The restaurant itself, while  decorated a little haphazardly (Chinese paintings?) is bright and clean. There's a TV on a wall, which happened to be playing one of my favorite Bollywood movies...so I was still excited about the place.But...after tasting the food...meh.The buffet was all right.. but nothing to write home about. Pluses? Once again, it had something different..fish curry as well as an Indian-style Chinese dish or two. So that was cool. But the food was just so-so. I was there fwith three other people - one of them said the cuts of meat, especially the chicken, were of higher quality than most Indian buffets. But he didn't like the sauces so much. One other friend said he liked the tikka masala, but that was about it.As for the vegetarians, well, we didn't have a lot of choices. Veggie manchurian (which was pretty good), a very bland chana masala and some pea/carrot thing that reminded me more of baby food than anything else.The dessert was just all right, too. And the rice was very bland.So, overall, I wasn't impressed. But I don't want to judge the place too harshly based just on the buffet. After all, Curry House was packed on a Saturday afternoon, so I'm thinking maybe it's got something better to offer me.. I'll have to go back for dinner and see what their non-buffet selections taste like before I totally write this place off my list.
other Love their salad bar, so much to eat, not as much as sweet tomatoes but good nevertheless! Only suggestion would b if they can get the labels on foods, bcs for people like me who don't eat meat its very difficult to figure out that there's tuna in one of their salads without a label! I almost ate it, so I hope they take this into account! My best is the whole boiled eggs though :)
other These dentists are great at explaining medical issues in a way that you can understand. They are honest and very smart. They don't take my insurance and I still go there (lets face it, dental insurance doesn't reimburse much, so it's only like a $1other difference for me to go out of network for a cleaning). I would never go anywhere else!
3 Came here last Saturday to see what it was all about but I really wish I had come on Friday instead.. The crowd was a little strange and consisted of mostly older people.. They played a mix of top 40s and hip hop whereas on Friday nights it's mainly hip hop.. The drinks run about $7-10 a piece and the bartender that helped me was very friendly! She even offered my friend and I a free shot.. The music wasn't very consistent so there weren't too many people on the dancefloor unless it was a hip hop song playing, so I spent most of my time sitting in their outdoor patio.. I love the decor and the ambiance but I really wasn't feelin the scene on Saturday.. I'm gonna have to return sometime on a Friday night to see how that goes..
other First time impressions are the most important and Culinary Dropout made an ever lasting one. Everything from the service to the food was spot on perfect. The whole experience was so good that it's hard to believe it will be the same when I go back. I hope it is............
other Have been going to LGO since 2003 and have always enjoyed the cuisine. Several times - either when ordering in the grocery or dining at the Pizzeria - the music has been so headsplitting as to wipe out any ambience or semblance of a welcoming neighborhood restaurant. Last night the demographic in the Pizzeria during the course of our meal ranged from 30-80 years of age. Several pleas to turn the music down just enough to be able to hear the waiter standing next to me were greeted with "it's just how we do things" and "there's no point in asking because they won't turn it down even a little". The waiter, David, said many servers consistently relay complaints but that the owner "really doesn't care". Hubris is so unappetizing. I think the food is great but, because I have no desire to support a business that really doesn't give a crap about its clientele, I'll spend my money lavishly elsewhere.
other Duke's is the top place in Scottsdale that my friends and I like to hit up to watch a game, or just grab a drink and bite to eat. The place is huge, the food is priced well for a bar, and there's almost always a decent beer special.In addition to several TVs placed around the bar, there's plenty of pool tables, dart tables, and shuffleboards to keep everyone entertained. The menu is big for a bar. The odd, also very good, part about that menu is the salad selection. Duke's has two pages of its menu dedicated to salads. While not something you'd expect from a sports bar, it's nice to know that there still is a healthy selection I can choose from while watching a game.Another cool feature is Duke's "No DUI Car."  It'll take you to your next destination.  How can you not like that?!
other Tiny downgrade for Mamma Mia's.  I have been here about a dozen times since my initial review, it's become one of our office lunch spots.  They have raised the prices on the sandwiches significantly. The chicken parm sub is now $6.9other instead of $5.50 and I will not be ordering it again. I ordered it today and it was really limp and the breading all fell off the chicken. Very little flavor, too much cheese, had to remove half of it.  It used to be so tasty and crispy, what happened.Anyway I still think they have the BEST pizza in the valley along with Venezia's. So I will continue to go and get their other slice and a drink deal for $3.50.
other Fun bar. Gets PACKED during happy hour, and on weekends after 9pm. Sometimes the music is a little too loud to hold a dinner conversation. But hey maybe I'm just getting old.The sushi is CONSISTENTLY good, above average good. Yes, as other reviewers noted, you can find better. But no other sushi place I've been to in Arizona can consistently serve up good fish every time I come in.
other I want to like this place as it is in the neighborhood and there aren't many other options around here, but this is probably the worst restaurant/bar I've ever had the misfortune of going to. My last trip I sat down to order a beer at the bar.  The bartender takes about five minutes to get me a beer, despite the bar being nearly empty, as he was too busy for me with his time and focus instead spent flirting with one of the servers.  I drink my beer and want another.  The glass sits empty for about five minutes while he paces around the bar.  I try on three occasions to get his attention and ask for another.  The dude is just ignoring me at this point.  I guess they don't want my business and I just leave.  He can have the 8 cents he owes me in change for a tip... I just want out of here.  I feel bad when I leave that he even got the 8 cents from me.  I hope he spends it well.On other trips here my wife and I have had the food.  It's not any better than the service sadly.  I have an English Bulldog at home with a poop eating problem and I'm not sure he would even find this food acceptable.  Overall just the worst restaurant around and it's no surprise why the place always looks so dead out front.  Nobody's there because it's simply horrible.  Avoid at all cost.  I wouldn't eat here again, but would give the bar another shot if I heard the replaced all the help.  Whoever owns this place needs to clean house.  Looking at other reviews on here, I see I'm not alone in my feelings about the service.  Get rid of these people already... just sad!!
other While I don't like to hype places up (because really, how GOOD can any one place be) ...How good can one burger joint be over another, or how good can pizza be over another pizza place (when weighing the ones that are all generally Good in the Public Opinion).  Now the word around town is that The Grind is Sofa_King Great.  I will say about The Grind that when you're up for a Burger, this place hits the spot.  I've been here once before August 2010 (don't remember what burger I had but recall it was good) and the other night I had the Peppercorn Burger and it was as good as it gets.  I was starving and really hadn't eaten all day and that helped add to how much this hit the spot, but make no mistake, it was really good and I do enjoy this place for the atmosphere, service, and quality of food.  My friends wife got one of those healthy wraps and she liked it a lot.  The sweet potato fries (we ordered the half sweet potato and half regular fries) and they were good.As for some other areas to review: The atmosphere is nice.  It's casual and not too dark and not too light inside.  (That's how I like it).  There's multiple flat panel TV's above the bar, so plenty of games on at any given time (That's also how I like it).  The service is fine (although based on some other reviews people have been so so satisfied about the service.  That's often going to be the case with most casual establishments - so sometimes it's good, and sometimes not to our satisfaction).  Such is Life!  Anyway, back on track here, the Wait staff and Bar staff have been worth the 20% tip both times.  No complaints by me about this place, however I do see some other and 3 star ratings on here.  Where I will dock other star and sort of agree with Kristi D.  She mentioned the large photo of Sheriff Joe Arpaio on the wall (while I sense that Kristi doesn't care for Sheriff Joe, I'm neutral about him), but I agree about all the oversized photos of notable names in town who have dined in The Grind.  I'd much rather see real artwork or real photographs on the wall - and not photos of Sheriff Joe, Mark Grace (for those who don't know, he's a former baseball player), and the Mayor of Paradise Valley, all holding their burgers.  Who the hell cares about any of them and their burgers.  I think I'd be more ok with having these photos above me, but they are HUGE enlargements and a bit overkill.  And they are for sale and the proceeds go to some cause.  Look, I'm all for causes and shit, but I wouldn't spend my money on a 36 inch enlargement of these local "notables" holding a burger.  The whole concept is pretty stupid.  But hey, I'm generally uptight and been doing photography 20+ years and probly am just hating on the fact that my photos are hanging on the wall. Side Note:  For those who might have previously had "Liked" The Grind on Facebook but no longer have their page as a Like, it's because they apparently had their group page hacked, so they had to start over.  I found this out when I Liked it the other day noticed there were only about 16other Like's, and certainly I knew this place was way more popular than that.  When I commented that, they commented back about it being hacked and starting the page over.http://www.facebook.com/thegrindarcadia
3 Perhaps if I waited outside in the heat for an hour plus to the point that I became starved and dehydrated, I too would have thought Matt's was worthy of other stars. Or maybe the other star reviews come from people too ashamed to admit that they wasted most of their morning on a very average breakfast.In my case, we came here before 7am on a Friday and got the last available seats by the window. Service was great; I didn't detect any attitudes from the waitstaff that has been mentioned in some reviews. They got our meal out quickly and made sure our coffee mugs never got empty.With the exception of the toast and jam, the food never rose above "good." Isn't that pretty sad that the best offering from a breakfast diner is the bread? I liked my waffle since it was a bit crisper than what I can do at home with my geriatric waffle iron, but there was nothing noteworthy about the flavor. My husband said his eggs were cooked perfectly with his chop and chick dish, but the pork chop was under-seasoned. He found the hashbrowns way too greasy to be enjoyable, and the bacon suffered from being overcooked.Maybe we're spoiled since we have two great breakfast places within walking distance (Joe's Farm Grill and the Coffee Shop). Matt's just isn't worth the drive or wait.
other I cannot stand this mall. They have some really awesome stores but the people who work in them are obnoxious. Most of the people walking around are snooty as can be, and everything is overpriced.The food court has some good selection, but is always super crowded and you can rarely find anywhere to sit.Parking is awful.
other I love their beef sandwiches and thin crust pizza. It is just like being back in Chicago. Love it!
other I don't frequent Tempe too often, but when I do, I try to get a Tea Infusion run in... everytime I succeed, I literally have a grin on my face after every sip. It's the least strip mall-esque dining option in the whole of Tempe Market place and that is a BIG PLUS in my book. Add to that that they make Boba Smoothies the way I like them... how could I resist?Case in point: The Pumpkin Chai. Based off the rattlings of fellow yelpers, I decided to try the chai and asked if it could be boba-fied (which makes me want to say Boba Fet) and they said "SURE!" It was delish, but that was summer and now it's winter and so warm sounded yummy but I had never had a hot boba drink before. So I asked them if I could have it with boba and hot and what did they say? "SURE! But be careful it's hot." And oh so YUM!I think they deserve the taglines "Have it your way" and "Any way you want it" more than Burger King! Because out of all the Boba places in Metro Phoenix they are the only ones that have never said "No" to me before with Boba Juice coming in a close second.... but only because their range of options is less.Add to that that they have a Boba Smoothie called Carribbean Colada and it is a pretty comparable alternative to my favorite Pineapple Lychee flavor that only the now defunct AZN of Mesa could prepare for me... so with just other of their drink options I am in Boba heaven... wonder what else they have in store for me if I ever tire of my usual options and try something different... don't know if I can... I might have to do a gluttonous double order or sip-taste from a friends selection.But wait... Boba's not all they've got, they've got a tea list comparable to that of Cheesecake Factories menu... it is a long one... I've had a blueberry tea, strawberry and a coconut one and they were all pretty tasty. I've also had a panini there and it was quite tasty and filling--I took leftovers home.My only wish is that the space Tea Infusion is housed in was more spacious with lounge seating in addition to table options so one can really settle in and work or chat with friends, but heck, I'm just happy they're here and serving the valley some tea-tastiness.I'll tea back REAL SOON!
other I have been taking vehicles to this place for 15+ years, mostly for routine maintenance, but occasionally for the other annoying things your car does to you. We have never had any problems with their service or repairs, and they have always been reasonably priced, fair and honest with us.They also refill propane tanks.Note -- this business has outlasted at least two gas suppliers. Previous names include McClintock Unocal and McClintock 76 :-)
other This place is kind of foreboding to enter... it just looks like a dimly lit house. But I had heard good things and went a few nights ago and it was adorable! It's like a bar in your living room. They have endless selections of beer and it's a fun environment. I definitely want to go back when there is a show going on as well. My only complaint is that there's no beer on tap!
other This is my kind of place. Had i not known of the Lost Leaf I would have never found it. Its a house in the historic district.  after hesitantly walking in, I find it to be a cozy dimly lit 'house' it reminded me of hanging out at a friends place in college (well replace the blacklight posters with art work). The beer selection is top notch as well as the music. i dont go out to bars much, seeing as I am on a drinking hiatus, but this is a place I would go to... just for the atmosphere, music and folks.
other I have lived all over the US, and I have experienced extreme lows and highs with dentists, but this dental group is by far my favorite I have ever been a patient of. I can't say enough good about them, so I won't ramble.... Just love them.
other Well, it's fresh, and it's easy.  Perfect words to describe this cute, clean little store!  This was my fave F&E in Phoenix because it was a mere block and a half from my place.  I STILL miss it, and I moved away from Phx over a year ago!  I popped in here several times a week to pick up staples, (it was always an adventure to see which prices had been marked down-- they even have a section in cold foods where they mark older stuff way down).  I appreciated their little bundles of veggies which were sold in just-right amounts (as in, not so much that some of it will end up going bad). This market was also great for soups (their brand was my pick, although they have a selection of major brands as well); it was also my go-to place for prepared healthful lunches perfect for work (like the F&E pre-made burritos and pasta dishes).  Check out frozen foods too-- there are reasonably priced items like tempura, and special organic seafood dishes I never found anywhere else.  I also liked the casual setup of the checkout area, with the option for a cashier or self-serve.  And...wait for it... I just found out they are opening at least two F&Es in Sacramento!!!  (okay, that won't likely cause much of a stir with the Phoenix crowd, but I am so excited they'll be open in my area!)
other other stars for bein the only bar in Phoenix where I was first scared to order a drink. but- thats why I love this place. That, and its near the Trunk Space.
other Fantastic Happy Hour 3-6pm! Half price appetizers and good drink prices. I like their Sushi and Garlic Noodles.And pretty much everything I've had there is good. I had a Peppercorn Steak about other weeks ago and it was amazing. It's right next to the movies so it's a good place to meetup too.
other it's tiny and awesome!
other Like they even need another review - they have a solid other stars as it is!Just got back from my first visit to Adobe, and I am beyond impressed. My German Shepherd pup was having some stomach issues over the holidays, so I decided to have him checked out to be on the safe side. I knew he didn't have an obstruction or other emergency issue, but I was concerned about parasites.The receptionist, Hilary, was super sweet on the phone and in person. She was upfront with what tests she thought would be ordered, and how much it would run me (and it wasn't an arm and a leg; the office call was only $56). I was very happy they'd be able to see me the next morning, but then she called back not 20 minutes later with a cancellation and said to come on in. Even better! The tech was very good with Nately's 40 pounds of squirming, and loved on him the whole time. I was also happy they let me help hold him - I've been to vets that called in a 2nd tech, like the owners aren't capable of safely holding their own dog. Okay, maybe some aren't, but I am, and I appreciate being able to and not being instructed like a child.Dr. Newland was AWESOME.The difference between him and some other vets I've been to?- Other vets: "Oh my God, we need to run $500 worth of expensive tests and start him on multiple medications", general sense of admonishment for not rushing him to their affiliated ER clinic, eagerness to run the bill up, very few questions about anything, etc... -Dr. Newland:  Super calm and personable. He spent 20 minutes going over everything (Nately's last few days of activity and stomach issues, diet, contact with other dogs, where I take him in public, anything he could think of really), felt his abdomen thoroughly, and said "Honestly, he's a puppy, they eat funny things, and something probably just irritated his stomach. He's plainly feeling pretty good, so just feed him a bland diet, give him this medication to settle his stomach, and bring a stool sample just in case, so you know for sure he's parasite-free".  He also dispensed advice for Nately's general care, as long as we were there, about heartworm prevention and  necessary vaccines, etc. I even got a good education on the different types of parasites and which were even likely in AZ's climate (turns out, not many). I really appreciated that he didn't try to frighten me into expensive diagnostics and possible serious diseases, and that he is so on his game and scientific/logical about things.I am very impressed and will be making Adobe my regular vet for as long as possible. If only they treated birds too!
3 I use to LOVE Kazimierz so I am trying to be fair in giving it 3 stars.  Most of my experiences have been other stars but the last two visits here have been a other or other star so...Kazimierz is a hidden, fantastic wine bar in Scottsdale, which use to be very intimate and was a great spot to cozy up to a date.  Lately though they have been packing people in to this awesome bar which has so much potential.  It's elbow to elbow now, with pretty bad service but still a great wine selection.  I'll still come here whenever I'm visiting the area because I have a soft spot for it, and I am hoping it returns back to the awesome, secret cozy wine get away it use to be, and I know in the area, there isn't really any other spot, no matter how bad the service, that compares to it.
other I loved the crispy crust of the pizza thought it was super good.  I think if you haven't been there and are at the San Tan Mall shopping that its worth a visit.  We went on a double date and it was a pretty good experience.  The only issue I had was that I thought they had a very small dining area, which was probably the reason for the 45min wait.  Also we went on a friday night and probably because of the small area it got very loud, which I know the management has no control over, but just an fyi of my experience.  I'd say if you haven't been and you love pizza its worth the visit.   I may try and stop in for lunch sometime but definitely not on a Friday night, it was just too busy.
other Ok I'm very surprised by the reviews on here. I'm not one to want to write negative  reviews but our food was so bad I couldnt help myself. Maybe this place was having an off night tonight but their pizza barely had any cheese on it and the crust was soggy. Unfortunately the pizza was better than the wings that were overly breaded and soggy as well. Thank God we had a groupon and didn't have to pay full price. Won't be ordering from here again. Disappointing :(
3 I'm sure this is a lovely Spa and Resort; sadly I was here for a conference.  Being the good worker I am, I did not see the pools, spas, or golf course.  I saw the conference rooms, my hotel room, and the restaurants.  I have to say the hotel rooms were nice, very large, each with a little patio.  The restaurants ands bar are all super expensive and not worth the price - but if you are sans-car you are trapped.  The saving grace here is the little 'coffee shop' by the entrance.  There they have very tasty sandwiches and beverages for a decent price - grab some eats there and go sit outside or on your patio.  You'll feel trapped on the complex...18 bucks will get a town car to take you to Old Town.  To get back to the hotel, go into a restaurant and ask them to call a cab for you...its hard pressed to find cabs on the street (least it was in the afternoon where I went into town).
other I have been shopping at Lee Lee's for over ten years.  The store stocks Chinese, Malaysian, Korean, Japanese, West Indian and other foods.  You can usually find what you are looking for here.  The fish selection is vast, fresh and reasonably priced.  They have the finest selection of noodles and yerba mate tea!!!Enjoy
other I was in the middle of a dilemma and needed proof of something faxed to me right away and stopped in here and got what i needed within just five minutes and was outta there and back to what i needed to take care of.  The price for two piece of paper for the fax was almost $3, which while is not the cheapest considering you can get it for free at home, but beggars cannot be choosers and was happy to pay it.
other An oasis of little kid fun in Phoenix, we hadn't been in over a year and came for a birthday party.  They're always running a deal, so look for one before departing.  One year we did an annual pass.  It was a good deal.  There are also lots of special events that include deals.  One time we met spiderman.There are lots of rides, mostly for shorter kids.  Some have modest height requirement that exclude the very young and some that exclude the tall.  There's a train, carousel, mini-coaster, tea cup ride, an up and down parachute ride, several rides that go in circles in different vehicles (e.g., planes, cars, and helicopters and futuristic flying machines), and a bumper boats ride that turns into a splash pad in the summer.  Determining whether the adults need a wrist band or tickets is always a little tricky as adults are needed on some rides, but not others, and it also depends on the age of the child.  The place has a little bit of a rundown feel, but kids don't notice and have loads of fun.  The arcade is really rundown, but the ATM is really nice.  There isn't much shade, so be prepared.  All of the staff are really nice.There are usually a few game and art vendors about: ball toss game, sand art, and/or face painting.  All are a big hit with the kids, but also hit up the wallet for a few bucks a piece.  Everyone is a winner at ball toss, by the way.
other I almost wish I hadn't discovered this place because it's so good! Ton's of flavors and every kind of topping you could want (even cake frosting) So much better than MoJo and to top it off the staff couldn't have been nicer.
other Love the shows the promoters bring in. Cozy spot where I've seen Owl City, A Fine Frenzy, Landon Pigg and more. Plus they are generous with the Malibu Rum :) You will need to visit the bar to get your own as I've never really seen cocktail servers. Oh well... Atmosphere is laid back, chill. A large patio. And yes, the Shaker Room. The hot, shake your stripper ass, place to be.
other Being a long time devotee of the Gelato Spot, I never gave this place a shot.  I must admit, the Marscapone gelato was very good.   I probably won't switch from Gelato Spot because parking is so much more convenient at 32nd & Camelback.  However, the next time I am out for a walk in the area or am in the mood for a sweet treat after dinner at Postino or LGO, I will definitely pop in.
other This review is for the food only.  If you care about parking and what kind of extras they sell that aren't food related you'll have to check out another review.I love LGO.  The food is absolutely top notch and I love how the menu has both traditional fare and a few things you've never heard of like their Venice Beach Burrito which is filled with scrambled eggs, tofu chorizo, spinach, and other goodies.  It comes with a side of salsa which also fantastic.  I eat breakfast here all the time and I have never been disappointed.  Also, if you're in a hurry grab one of their pre-made granola/yogurt/fruit parfaits, Yum!
other Bleh.Most of us have ventured to the rock at some point in time. It has always been quite awful, but I had some hope after new ownership took over and renovated the place. It is always sad to see a place that has potential, be complete crap.Upon walking in we were greeted by a small room used as a bar area, with random bar tables along the side. And whales. And scary looking people. And a DJ...well...kinda...he was playing music from a computer..you know...like you would so at home.We ordered two beers and sat down. Why not give it a chance, right? Just when we thought that things couldn't get worse, we heard a sound. Like a squealing sound. Yes, you guess right, horrible karaoke ON A FRIDAY NIGHT!?!?! Why God, why?????We chugged our beers and left.
other There's a lot to love about this quick but hearty Mex Grill.  I love walking in seeing that the guys standing in the open kitchen are roasting peppers and chopping tomatoes for their salsa bar.  A lost art most would say in a place that seems like could be your typical chain, quick fix, "Fresh Mexican Food"...  The two owners are buddies as the name proclaims and they are a friendly bunch.  The food though is why this place is a small gem in  the NW Valley.  The Burritoes are huge and would challenge Chipotle's size, but also put to shame the cold taste you get from Chipotle's burritoes, from ingredients sitting out cold like a Subway line...  The Burrito Especial is really good which has big pieces of shrimp and some nice chunks of zucchini.  The steak served in their burritoes is also very impressive, nice grilled taste and definately not chewy.  The sides are generous when you get a combo and the salsa is nice and fragrant.  Overall this is a great place to eat, period.  The three flat screens hung up high always have football games on, on weekends.  Awesome food  that cooked right next to dining area has never seemed to dissapoint us.
other I purchased the introductory groupon they offered a few weeks ago, and was hesitant at first because I haven't had the greatest experiences using groupons.  I was pleasantly surprised.I did look at some of the bad yelp reviews before going in, which made me nervous! So for those of you that only look at bad reviews, I hope you see this one and have a little more hope.I had a stylist named Annie, she had pink hair.  Super friendly, and really appeared to want to get my style right.  Since I had read bad reviews before coming in about stylists not listening to the customer when they asked for the curling iron to be used for better curl, I was concerned she would do the same.  But, I let her know I was looking for good curl, and with thin/straight hair, it can be tricky to achieve.  She attempted to curl with just the round brush and hair dryer first, and when she was "impressed by her curling abilities with a round brush," she was "equally impressed with my hair's inability to hold a curl." So she broke out the curling iron!We made great small talk, and I let her know I would be back in a month when I go out to celebrate my birthday.The salon is a fun, well-decorated environment.  It was pretty loud with the hair dryers going, but not terrible.  The less than perfect rating was that I saw people with mimosas/champagne, and while I had been offered something to drink, I figured I could just choose water or coffee, as that is usually is what at hair salons, I wasn't informed of my choices by the front desk staff.  Now I know for next time to ask for some bubbly!Another good tip is to plan for longer than 4other minutes if you are planning to do a style with curls.  While I got started on my appointment about 5-10 minutes late, I was there for other hour (and I dont have super long, thick hair that takes a great deal of time).I will be back in January for my 25th birthday night!
other We had a very nice meal here last night. The curries were pretty authentic and carried enough spice to make them very tasty. Unusual location but it wasn't hard to find. Good service, though we were only ones there when we finished at 8pm.
other Service, awesome.  Food, spectacular.  Price, unbeatable. I can't tell you how many times this restaurant has saved my life.  Richard is very understanding when I come in completely hung over, and knows to put extra kimchi in my side dishes.  Also, in terms of the local "$20 all you can eat" sushi specials, this is the only place that ever pops into my head as  a place I need to go.  Their sushi chef if spectacular and super friendly so it's always a nice time sitting at the bar.They have a special lunch menu that is served only during the week, so you can expect the dinner menu on Saturday and Sunday regardless of the time you go.  Both menus are amazing, it's just that the menus are slightly different in their options so if you have a specific craving (and I often do) you might have to concede to something different once you get there.  It's mildly annoying, but the food never disappoints so I let it go.Try it, you wont be disappointed.
other Love this place! Super fun you never know what you will find until you find it!So here's the deal I just adore to browse in there and get ideas-seriously how can you go wrong?I found a ridiculous item which I'm not sure that I want to share online-oh well lets do it. So you know when you buy hot dogs and the package doesn't seal back up? So of course the container store would have something as silly as a hot dog container to hold the rest of your package.  Plus they had great large jars, and shoe boxes, and lots and lots of containers.I think if I could get away with it I would build a room of containers! I love to have things organized and the container store if fun to look at.Check it out!
3 3/5the sandwiches are huge. i'm not to bent on the whole freedom fries this and such on the menu, but it is AZ so i guess that is how it runs.
3 Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? Be entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?Are you 50 years old and Caucasian?Then the Golden Buddha is the place for you! Its in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. For dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting "real Chinese" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.The best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. They do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.Come here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.
other Hiking Camelback Mountain has to have been the most difficult other 1/other mile hike (Just up, 3 miles total) that I have ever been on. While it is not a very far distance the increase in elevation is over 1000 feet in that short mile and a half. The first thing that I recommend is either getting to Echo Park at bright and early (between 4:30-5:30 am) or, if you come later as I did just parking in the overflow parking. You can find a simple map to the overflow parking at: http://phoenix.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Camelback-Mountain-Trailhead-Overflow-Parking.pngThe walk to the Echo Canyon trail head to the overflow parking is only about 20-2other minutes and it is almost guaranteed to be faster than driving around looking for a parking spot somewhere else. The trail itself takes about 20 minutes to actually get difficult but when it does decide to start getting hard it does not let up for a moment. There are chain link fences at a couple of places in the hike to stop people from accidentally tumbling over very steep ledges and even handrails at times for more support up the trickiest sections of the hike. The good and bad of this hike is how crowded it is. There will rarely be a moment where you wont see someone coming or going for more that 50 yards at a time. This means that while there is little to no quiet and privacy, that if something were to happen to you there would be plenty of witnesses.The rest at the top is wonderful. The view is by far the best in the valley and something that I recommend to everyone. Take 20 minutes or so to eat a snack, drink some water, take a breather and take some breathtaking pictures from the summit. The summit is usually pretty crowded so you won't want to stay too long. Be careful on the way back. It can be very tricky navigating some of the areas and twisted ankles and even broken legs are not terribly uncommon. Again, take you time and take plenty of breaks when you need them and you should be OK.Don't forget to take plenty of water, I recommend at least a liter per person if you go in the morning and more that that if you do in when it is warmer outside.
other Alright we are going to say that this place is Awesome!  The service is outstanding and the food wonderful!    We came here for Breakfast on Sunday Morning .             They were very busy ,but, we did not have to wait too long at all.                                    Our server Colleen was great!   She greeted us right away and  brought our drinks very quickly.   The food was very good and just love their Potatoes.  The menu is fantastic! Lots to choose from. We like the decor and lots of parking in the lot. Nice Place and we will be back!
other This place was so bad on so many levels I'm not even sure where to begin. Our server kept calling me honey.. and seemed to be in such a hurry she wouldn't stop and listen to me. You know how needy I can get and need to be listened too and heard. We started by ordering the Baked Spinach and Artichoke Dip..  what I couldn't understand is 1, how did the chef let this go out and 2, no one but us could smell the scorched burnt smoke coming off the dish. This thing was so badly burned and scorched it was completely inedible. Sent it back and she didn't even offer to bring another one. Perhaps it was because they were so busy they just wanted the food to go out?So I ordered their Famous BBQ Ribs.. I hate complaining to much but these were old ribs.. maybe maybe a day or other before.. pork takes on a funky taste when its fridged for to long.. the texture of the meat (when you could find any) was like jerky. I happily ate my Creamed Spinach (other star yummy) and didn't eat more then other bones of the ribs. When the waitress came to clear the plates (she never checked on us) she asked if I was full. I told her that the ribs weren't to my liking.. she smiled and asked if I wanted dessert. Over all I would never come back to Don and Charlie's.. aside from the  Creamed Spinach, which I can make myself, there weren't many redeeming qualities. A shame too because it's so close to the house. I don't get it because the Yelps are so good. Maybe they were having  a bad night? It was so bad I wouldn't ever go back to find out.
other Great early bird specials on wine and mini-pitchers of beer before 5pm, only $5.  The food is very good and taylored to a wine menu.  A very nice place for a date with your wife or significant other.
other Ok...  I'm a Die Hard Jimmy Buffett Fan - a Parrot Head through and through!But...  This place sucked.  I've been to half a dozen different Margaritaville Restaurants and I knew what to expect, but this one by far failed to meet my minimal expectations.The service is slooooow, food is canned and poor quality, drinks are weak and expensive.  The only upshot was all of the Jimmy Buffett paraphernalia and music, and I've already got a lot of that stuff.The next time I'm itching to get my island groove on, I'll do it right.  We'll grill chicken and burgers in the back yard, put the booze in the blender, light the Tiki torches, invite 20 or 30 people over and jam to Jimmy.  More fun to set sail to St. Somewhere in your own back yard than it is to have to endure the Glendale Margaritaville.FINS UP!
other This is the only work of his that I have seen in person. After living in the valley since 2002, I FINALLY decided to head out that way.  I found the information about the life and times of Frank Lloyd and his 3rd wife very interesting. The house was amazing and beautiful. I especially loved the local rocks cast into the concrete, and the lines that created a flow.   I would highly recommend this tour to any one with an interest in form, function, and beauty.
other Great selection, TONS of flavor, always hot and fresh, nice staff, great prices. In my top 3 quick restaurants.
other Just don't.
other Verde = good, quick, close-by & cheap = YAY!!!!So...We went for breakfast last week and here is the result: green chili pork: Delish!!! Tortillas: Delish!! Eggs: Yuck!! Guacamole: Good!!The breakfast eggs are the 'fake eggs' - you know the ones that come in a pourable carton...honestly a little disappointing, because other sunny-side up eggs wouldve been muy bueno!!but everything else was on-point so i just wont order eggs again! :)we also ordered take-out this week: the whole lime-oregano rotisserie chicken it was MUY DELISH!!! This is not your grocery store rotisserie - the flavor was amazing!! the whole fam luved it and devoured it -Verde will be my new go to when i dont want to cook dinner or when i need a quick lunch!
other This restaurant is truely cultural experience in your mouth---Chinese, Mexican with a dash of Jamaican. Pollo Diablo is fab! Mom and Pop place with some true TLC that goes into the food. The beer and wine was a good selection as well! Way to Go!
other Dr. Lee does excellent work and he and the staff are very friendly and professional.  The best dental care I have ever received and I have lived all over the country and grew up at the dentist with my bad teeth.  They work very well with children also.
3 My boyfriend and I were searching for a dive near our house in Old Town for when we just aren't feeling the typical Scottsdale vibe.  I gotta tell you, I think we found it.  We walked in around 7 on a Thursday night, just looking to have a few drinks and some time to talk.  I immediately realized this was not an Old Town bar.  I think I might have been the youngest person there and no one was pretentious at all.  They have a dart board and pool table, and seating with walled mirrors all around.  The patio was extremely well-misted, which was great since it was the day before 4th of July and everyone was pretty much sweltering.  Drinks were stiff and not too expensive and the crowd grew younger as the night went on.  I didn't meet tons of people, but the ones iI did either seemed drunk, super nice or both - not a bad combination.  I would go back again, just not every night (what do you think I am, an alcoholic?)Also - for those of you with bladders of steel and small wallets, I saw a sign that says they do bladder buster deals on Tuesday night.  Small cover and incredibly cheap drinks until someone "breaks the seal".  I would suck at this, but I'm sure many a person has taken advantage of this interesting drink special.
other DON'T GET TIFFANY UNLESS YOU WANT A SPEEDY EXPERIENCEPretty Nail tale with Tiffany-My 10 year old first mani/pedi4:3other water and feet in chair only 13 minutes and painting toes. Prepped and painted fingernails from the chair- in 20 minutes. 3other minutes in all. Told owner I was unhappy and she said that a kid mani/pedii was 3other minutes then later 3other to 4other minutes. Tiffany never let it dry between coats so when she sat her under the light she told her only other more minutes and I stopped her. She said only the under coats will be wet and the top will be dry. I told her Really because you never even let it dry between coats.  She said not other coat. Base other color and top is other ... well top and base dry fast she said...Owner said" fast or slow it doesn't matter as long as the polish looks good and it looks good." I didn't tip her on purpose...not because I'm poor- I got poor service. I would expect this for a color change but not a spa pedicure/manicure.  Very disappointed.  You'd think the owners would realize that all the other patrons saw her take advantage of us.  Get anyone but Tiffany unless you want a quick job!
other I was initially going to give Riva's 3-stars, as they're really just like any other Filiberto's/Umberto's/Roberto's/Ernie and Berto's out there, except for a couple of small differences.For one, everything seems to be just a little bit more fresh there.  It's probably not, but it tastes like it.  And secondly, their little salsa bar is killer because their green salsa has plenty of flavor and they always have fresh pico de gallo out there, a must for any burrito.The California Burrito, with carne asada, potatoes, pico de gallo and cheese, is a must, as is the standard Carne Asada Burrito.  But the real winner here is the Carne Asada Fries.  A metric ton of carne asada piled on top of freshly fried french fries, sour cream, cheese and guacamole for only $5?  Can't be beat, especially if you're hammered and it's 3 A.M. Not a classy joint, not a place you go if you're wary of stupid crap like "health code violations" (the best places never are), but definitely a late-night hot-spot for the Mill crowd.  Lovely.And it's not for sissies that don't like ham in their beans either, damnit.
other Donuts are worst I've ever had. I bought other dozen donuts using their 10.99 sale and it was the worst donuts I have ever had in my life. All the donuts were dry and stale. I should have gone a couple of miles over and bought Krispy Kreme. Krispy Kreme donuts are always fresh. These ones were worst that those that sat on the shelf for a week in a supermarket!
other Came here and did drive-though to pick up a turkey sandwich and the "man" salad.   The salad was really good!!!!  On a hot summer day, the salad is a perfect choice for lunch!!!
other Lovato's was the first place that I ever went to spend more than $1other dollars on a haircut. They are awesome. The place is family owned, and Art and his son Scott both had their turn at cutting my nappy hair and made it look spectacular! I have since opted for someplace closer but often miss conversing with Scott about working out with his Ultimate Fighting friends. He often had the bruises to prove it. Art would generally blow dry my hair making it slightly poofy and not unlike his own Frankie Avalon style, but once I got home and styled it on my own, the cut was perfect.Mrs. Lovato, whose first name I really wish i could remember, always offered some ice cold lemonade while I waited and I always felt like an honored guest. Scotts kids can often be found sweeping the floors in the summer and they are about the cutest things you will ever see.For guys that like a masculine place to get their haircut, but want time and attention given to their look at the same time, this place is perfect.They do all that chicky stuff too including waxings but I can't say that I got experience from them on that end.
other We came here the weekend of the Grand Opening. I will say we were very impressed and  there was so much to choose from at this new and improved Pets Mart.  There is a Hotel here for Cats and Dogs. There is a Banner Pet hospital, and there is a Grooming station ,as well as a Dog training store as well. Talk about your one stop shopping. I even got to hold a beautiful baby girl Pug just 6 weeks old. She was absolutly adorable.   We took a picture but have not figured out how to download it yet. Nice and Clean all throughout the store . We purchased a few items and then we were on our way.  Lots of Parking in the lot. Plus nice clean human bathrooms.
other This is our new post-hockey game hangout.  It helps that it is in the rink and that our usual server Rachel is prompt.  It helps that she is cute also.  We came the first time on one of it's first nights and it wasn't very busy.  The manager let us play the virtual sports game.  It has hockey, football, soccer, baseball, and golf.  We played for free, but it is rather pricey to use.  It was fun, but I don't think it would be worth using your dollars on.  The bar is owned by the same people who own Overeasy in Phoenix.I have only had the Black Bean Burger so far, but I tell you what.  It is f-ing good!  It has tomato, lettuce, red onion, and avocado.  I don't normally like avocado, but it's creaminess adds to it.  It has just a little bit of spice too. It comes with fries that are good enough.The bar itself has cool interior and has lots of TVs around the place.  The booths even have their own televisions.  There is a large monitor at the front with a Wii hooked up.  I strained my shoulder after last weeks game bowling and playing ping pong.   So if you find yourself cheering on the Rubber Mallets, enjoying an ice skating session, or watching someone at a figure skating competition at the Alltel Ice Den, be sure to stop into 18 Degrees for a brew and a bite.
other A little pricey for my liking, but good nonetheless.  I really like the feel of the restaurant: part Cuban, part Puerto Rican, part Spanish, all classy.  A guitar player jammed away in a completely non-annoying way while we ate our meal and, to me, that is an accomplishment.Our Calypso Chips were outstanding.  To die for.  One of the best appetizers I can think of at the moment.  For my entree, I ordered the Ropa Vieja which was made up of the most perfectly tender beef and tasty rice with beans.  A little heavy with the peppers, however.Does anybody else think plantains smell like feet?  My date pointed this out and, although I was surprised, I'm inclined to agree.  That won't stop me from putting some into my stomach as soon as humanly possible.
other Worth a visit. This is good food, not good people watching. Think: Colorado take on southwestern food. Ate: Pork Green Chili app. Grub. Little kettle of the stuff with four fresh made tortillas that arrive folded in a white paper bag - hot. 4.7/other for flavor, quantity, value, and presentation. "Big Ass Burger."  All made in house. Even the bun and fries. I don't think they keep the cattle there though. Burger was loosely packed, over-cooked, and a bit salty for my taste. But I am a critic. Jen thought it was average too. Also now $13 - was $10 6 mos ago according to other reviews. 2.75/5"Huckleberry Bread Pudding."  Whoa. Like a hot gooey berry muffin with Ice-Cream. Awesome. Jen thinks it might be her favorite dessert of all time. 5/5We were a little worried when we saw all the snow-birds in their ivy caps and studded mom jeans. Turned out to be just fine - and the service was pretty special for how reasonably priced everything was. Portions were serious - Jen and I shared everything and were stuffed. Can't imagine orgering your own app, entre, and dessert. No way. Sorry about the typos. It's bright out here in the Scottsdale sun by the pool...
other Having gone to the now-closed location on Shea, I didn't expect to find myself at the new The Herb Box anytime soon.  My one visit was fine, but didn't leave me wanting more.  However, when Deb L hosted a recent UYE, it was the perfect opportunity for great company at the very least.  Well I'm happy to report I received even more than great company....great food, great service, and comfortable, yet beautiful surroundings were also on the plate.  I began the evening with a glass of their house-made sangria.  I could drink this light and fruity beverage all day.  In fact, I think it would make a fine substitute for my morning OJ.  I did have a hard time choosing an entree.  While I was tempted by the pear and gorgonzola flatbread, I chose the goat-cheese chicken instead.  The shoulder cut chicken was perfectly cooked, but the meat itself was perhaps a little bland, although admittedly I do prefer chicken to be well-seasoned.  The goat cheese stuffing and the fig jam, however, resulted in an overall quite tasty dish.  I loved the mushroom risotto cakes served alongside!!The Herb Box also graciously offered our table a variety of sweet treats at the end of the meal...a slice of fig bundt cake (my favorite), a couple different cupcakes, a whoopie pie, and a passionfruit cake.  While all were enjoyed, none of these wowed me.  I do think these may have been pastries available at the market, and not their dessert menu items.   So thanks to Deb for giving me a reason to try The Herb Box.  I'm sure I will be back again!  I didn't get a chance to browse the market!
other This place is disgusting!!  The bun was dry and stale.  The veggie burger was yucky... I don't think I have ever had one I didn't like before.  The kids meals are miniscule.  The topping bar is so simple and plain.  The dips are not very good... cheese dip is YUCK!  Drink choices stink.  Cookies taste raw and boring.  Almost forgot to add that the two young kids didn't even care for the french fries because they are seasoned.  I thought they were a total waste of calories.  I can't believe the prices either... so not cheap or even worth what you pay for.
3 I don't know why it is that all these airports have such a major lack of seating.  The staff here are friendly, and security is quick, but I just wish they'd work on the gate areas and add more seats.  Need an example?  Sacramento International's new terminal.
other This is the best restaurant chain EVER!!!!  I love EVERYTHING there and the service has always been A+.  The fried zucchini strips (appetizer) are the best in the world, the Caesar salad is the best I ever had, even their croutons on the salad are better than any!!!  Olive oil herb dip is Fabulous, the warm bread is like no other.  Most of the dinners that I have tried have been excellent but the Chicken Bryan is magnificent.  Waiters and manager the best.
other I love that it's all a self serve line. You pick your yogurt and can mix flavors and then add any other toppings you want! Fabulous!
other I came here for a Yelp event and had a great time. They have the place somewhat divided into two sections- bar and restaurant. I liked that the patio opens right into the bar so you kind of have an extended bar. The food was really good and the staff rocked. I have been meaning to go back. I'll put that on my to-do list!
other Anyone who tells you this place isn't amazing is cu cu for coco puffs. The owners are equally amazing. They will remember you and tell you amazing stories and the cocktails are always amazing. My favorite is the lychejito made from lychee infused vodka made in house. The spring roll bar is amazing and they always change it up for me if I ask for substitutions. There really isn't anything on the menu that isn't good they offer everything from Vietnamese sammies to amazing clay pots. I always go for the soup but that hasn't stopped me from trying everything else. Everything is always fresh and delicious. Their happy hour is awesome as well.
other I went to Peter Piper Pizza tonight to celebrate my daughter's 5th birthday! It is a great place for kids to have fun. Being a former employee of PPP I know that we could have had reservations for her birthday and had a party representative help with everything. Unfortunately, this was just a small family celebration. So I ordered the big family meal deal which consisted of two large pizzas and an order of wings. The pizza is always delicious to me, it is not greasy like some of the pizza places out there. We forgot to bring a lighter for the birthday candle so they had one on hand for us to borrow. Needless to say this is a place that the kids love. They can eat great pizza & play which is all kids worry about.
3 I had a good time at Monkey Pants, we celebrated a buddy leaving for basic training. I will have to go back again. And the one o'clock shirtless shot was awesome. Sorry I don't have more to report because I was drunk and don't remember much else, so that tells you it must be good.
other I've been going to this place for years, and they have always stayed true to their own style.  The place is a bit shabby, but the food is delicious. Their prices are decent, not too expensive not too cheap.  The staff is friendly enough, and if anything ever goes wrong, they have no problem fixing it.All in all, a good place to grab a slice of pizza.
other I recently went to The Breakfast Club for the first time with a good friend who I hadn't seen in awhile. It was a weekday and so, while it was still busy, we didn't have to wait to be seated. The food was good, but slightly over-priced. My biggest problem with the restaurant - the service. They were slow to deliver our drinks and food, yet once our food came, they were swarming around like bees every five minutes to take our plates so we could get out of there. I felt like they didn't care at all for the fact that I was having a nice morning with a good friend but instead wanted us to pay and leave. After we had been there for just over an hour and fifteen minutes, out waitress actually told us to leave the table and finish our conversation outside so they could seat other customers. We were mortified. I have NEVER been asked to leave a restaurant in my life. Needless to say, they didn't win a loyal customer with me.
other Humble Pie is right across from one of my favorite hang-outs, The Main Ingredient. I've seen this place numerous times and one day we saw a Groupon for them, so decided to purchase it and give it a try. The place was fairly dead for a Saturday night. I had always seen this place packed when passing by. Maybe we missed the rush? The service was nothing special. Our server had no personality and seemed bored. I ordered a pizza with pistachios, parmesan and red onions and my boyfriend ordered some kind of BBQ chicken pizza. The pizza was dry and didn't have a ton of flavor. It wasn't AWFUL, but it wasn't REMARKABLE either. We left unimpressed and don't really have any craving to go back there again. Wish we understood what all the hype is about. Maybe we just ordered the wrong pizzas?
3 The selection at this store is fantastic!  But I've come to expect the worst from the sales staff, the only hello you get are from the girls standing at the counter when you walk in and even that seems forced.  When I actually need help I feel as though I don't want to disrupt the employees in the middle of their very intense conversations.  I've learned to do my own  research on what ever it is I'm looking for before I go into this particular store.
other This is my favorite Sushi Spot in Phoenix. I see Sushi Chefs from other restaurants coming here to eat during their off time. =)The prices are very reasonable, and all of the rolls and sashimi are very fresh and crafted to perfection by the old timers.The Ramen Noodle Bowl is awesome, and nothing like what you would buy in the grocery store. It is topped with pork, fish cake, bamboo, and seaweed. I highly recommend.They even have a fried salmon skin roll, which was very flavorful and not always available at every establishment. I wish that i would have taken a picture of the last one that I purchased, it was absolutely perfect.They also offer Takoyaki, which is like an octopus dumpling ball. You would have no idea that it contained octopus unless you were familiar with the dish. these are absolutely amazing and highly addictive. You have to try these during your visit.The last time that I was there, I had to try the Ichigo Mochi Ice Cream. It was green tea ice cream, surrounded by a rice flour shell and topped with whipped cream. It really hit the spot and I was so full but in a happy and satisfying way.If you like Sushi, and you think that RA is cool, hit yourself on the head for being a complete fool and go check this place out and get schooled on what fresh authentic Sushi is all about. Your mouth will thank you for doing the right thing!Cheers and keep up the good work at the place.FYI... Bring your own Saki if you need booze with your meal. I say, just enjoy the good meal without alcohol and see how happy and relaxed the meal makes you feel.
other The part worth going to this event is definitely the ostrich race event. Imagine men sitting on plumpy ostriches and then falling off. It is hillarious. These brids are actually dangerous so props for them for sitting on them in the first place. The event was highly entertaining and they get participation from the audience. There is a petting zoo portion that has all sorts of animals from an ox to baby goats. You can even feed the animals for a small price. The rest of the festival was pretty usual. Over priced food and lots of crowds. I would recommend going the $10 paid was worth the hilarious entertainment.
other I am so in love with the exceptional level of service provided at this diamond in the rough naturopathic clinic! It may not look like much from the outside. Inside the unsurpassed warmth and tenderness is ideal for a deeply enriching, healing experience. I was gifted a 90 minute massage and was not disappointed. The masseuse was knowledgeable and hyper receptive to my needs. I walked in trapped in a bubble of negativity. When I left I was literally floating... I felt cleansed and utterly flawless. Another major plus was that the entire indulgent, spirit lifting experience was under $40. A professional, extraordinary 90 minute massage for under $40?! Seriously go for it!
other This place has gone so downhill. If I hadnt gotten my chips, salsa & water immediately, I wouldve walked out. Margaritas are always awesome. But the service and food is straight up AWFUL. Microwaved enchiladas, no rice, rude, cold, unfriendly, uninviting service...If you're looking for a fabulous, neighborhood mexican restaurant, try Las Glorias Grill. The location isnt as great, but the food, service and drinks, blows this place outta the water. After years of going to aunt chiladas, Im NEVER going back again. They dont deserve your money either....
other Don't miss the carne asada! I love the carne asada mini quesadillas.
other Everything here just seemed so very dry to me.  Like it was mass prepared a few days ago and they reheat it, put sauce on it and serve it.  The sushi felt the same way somehow.
other I almost don't even want to write a review for this place. It's so near and dear to my heart and I basically live here that I just don't know how to NOT write a novel of a review for this place. So I'll attempt to bullet point my feelings on the joint:A. Friday Happy Hour - need I say more? Pretty sure all the homies would agree that we've spent thousands of dollars here over the years. You're welcome Lodge. B. Cheese Curds - FRIED cheese balls and ranch. nuff said. C. Best server ever, my homeboy Michael (you guys need to give him a raise. I haven't seen him around much lately and I'm pretty sure that's why I've been at Kelly's more recently)D. Black-outsD+. I have a scar on my left knee where I ate shit playing cornhole. How do you eat shit playing cornhole? No clue. Probably because of the above point listed above. E. Lodge stimulus package - $6 for a can of PBR, a shot of nasty ass whisky, and a cigarette. BEST DEAL IN TOWN. Pretty sure the ex got nice and hammered a few times off this lil package - great deal ladies. Get your man sloshed and then take advantage of him. Always a good idea. The only reason why there's not other stars is sometimes when you sit on the patio, it takes about a year for a server to come around. Best bet it to hunt one of them down and start a tab that way. Oh The Lodge. Such great memories here...and most of them are just hazy bits and pieces.
other What a great find! We purchased a deal chicken for this restaurant as we had never tried before. We had an absolutely fabulous dinner start to finish. We started with Caprese salad and stuffed mushrooms both were very good, then for entrees, we had Chicken florentina and Pasta romantico. Both sauces were the best we have had! The atmosphere is like you are in Italy. I would have never figured from the location but we will be regulars.
3 I like this place because of how original it is and the menu has something for everyone.Unfortunately it is tucked away in a hard to spot location and therefore continues to be a great secret.I would recommend to anyone in Arizona to make a trip over and see what this place is all about. I think everyone will be happy with it.
other I've been a patient of Dr Lienau's since I was six years old!  I usually don't care who my primary care physician is, but when it comes to my dentist, there's no way in heck I would switch.  I even referred a co-worker to him recently!  He's very honest, upfront, and has such a great support staff.  Colleen is the NICEST receptionist!  One of the hygienists has been there for years (I forgot her name!!) and is also a very friendly woman.I definitely recommend Dr Lienau!
other Two stars for bad service and, damn, I have to the tell the truth, a lousy appetizer.  Had the braised leeks to start, which appeared to have been made less of leeks and more of a white cheese that I can only assume had been allowed to congeal into a rubbery mat beneath a heat lamp.  It was literally impossible to cut into bite-sized pieces, and was tasteless besides.  Then, after at least a half an hour wait, pasta with chanterelles.  The shrooms were great, and I have to say I enjoyed fennel for the first time in my life, but the pasta was enormous in size and there was an awful lot of it.But one of my friends had the fried green tomatoes, which were wonderful, and another had the brussell sprouts, also wonderful, and the butterscotch pudding dessert with the nutmeg whipped cream was simply divine.They were very busy (our reserved table was 20 minutes late and the seats were still warm when we sat down), so I'm thinking they were just run off their feet.  I'd give them another chance.Oh, and a delightful Arizona sauvignon blanc.  I'm told they serve only Arizona wines, which is kinda cool..
other Upon our overnight stay at Econolodge a few blocks down, the live lit sign along side of the street attracted me to try this restaurant.  I remember the menu vaguely, however did not forget the amazing breakfast special the other half and I ordered.  $6 for a plate of thick cut bacon, other eggs made your way, hash browns, and toast (white/wheat/rye, etc.)  Customer service was great, the hostess and waitress made us feel very comfortable!
other The new store is smaller than the previous one. But it's still a reliable digging source for records. I wish there was a better selection of dance tracks, but that isn't really their thing. They did have the new Chromatics and Glass Candy 12" singles when I was in there last, which was nice.Great selection of hip hop vinyl, some awesome indie records, etc. Definitely recommend this if you're in the Tempe area.
other Not a great experience last night at Eastwind. I'm going to start this by saying that I've been eating here for over 20 years, when it was Tokyo Express and now Eastwind. I was a customer weekly when I lived closer, now it's every 60 days or so.We went for dinner around 8:00 and it took way too long to get seated in the half empty restaurant. We were seated next to a family that must have been friends or family with one server, as she was constantly at their table. She was there while we were waiting and obviously saw us before finally showing us to a table.  Our server was a guy that must have been new, as he seemed very nervous and didn't know the menu.  So we ordered the sushi sampler for me and the Korean beef and a veggie roll for her. I got the sushi, but not the salad and soup that it comes with. The veggie roll turned into an egg roll. Everything came at once, and the server didn't make his return until we were done. After consulting with server #1, he took off the egg roll and our drink. Guess that's supposed to make up for it....
other Trendy, Current, and a young 20s crowd. You know its trendy when you see all the waitress' in black fish net tights and short black dresses. You dine while they play a great music selection with lights all over! Its like eating at a lounge right before the place turns into a night club. Very city-like. Come for Happy hour!! I came here with 3 other classmates: Angela, Julie, and Natalie. When they said happy hour for sushi, I was thinking a low key place that was A-OK. I was completely wrong. This place is trendy and hip, which is unlike the suburbia of Mesa. During happy hour, my friend and I split the Calamari, Calamari Sushi Roll, chicken wings (6 pieces) and a Margarita, and it came out to $22. Not bad! I like the ambiance, and its definitely something I will be coming back to!
other Good boutique hotel with nice amenities. Clean and contemporary I'd definitely stay here again!
other Went on a recommendation from my brother...I owe him a beer or something!  Great, great food.  The bbq is the best I've had anywhere, hands down.  The prices are great.  We tried all of their sides while there (Group of 5, and you get other sides with each meal, so we did it on purpose).  The potato salad was pretty disappointing, and is the only thing holding me back from other stars.  The rest were delicious.  DO not miss out on the BBQ beans or the mac & cheese (I know, "mac and cheese--really?") YES.  Little bits of their smoked bacon mixed in makes it so, so good. Sweet potato fries were really, really good as well. I did not try the waffle fries, but my husband liked them & he is a waffle fry snob.Had the pulled pork, spicy sausage, beef brisket, ribs...all of it delicious.  They have a wide variety of sauces you get to pick out & add yourself, or just eat the meat straight up.My 1other year old daughter said that "the food tastes like the air smells when you go camping" (she was referring to that delicious smokey flavor...it was cute to me).The place is small, but I don't blame them for that--you have to be able to establish yourself in this economy or you'll go under.  Hopefully they will be able to expand someday.  Driving out from Mesa won't be easy!!
other How to Have a Good Time at Cowboy Ciao:1) Order the Stetson chopped salad. 2) Finish it.3) Order the Peanut Butter Brownie Upside Downy. (Note: DO NOT question whether you're full or not. It doesn't matter).4) Finish it.
other The food here is awesome every time I come here we have a great time And the waitress kimberly Couldn't ask for better waitress
other I tried El Pollo Supremo based on a recommendation from my professor. I always though he was a smart man, but after eating here I know it. For under $other you get chicken  that is juicy and flavorful and a plateful of tasty sides and condiments. Wrap it all up in one of the piping hot tortillas that comes with your meal and enjoy. Another testament to the quality of the food is the fact that on my most recent visit no fewer than three police officers stopped in for lunch. You don't get that kind of patronage unless you are everything that El Pollo Supremo is: cheap, fast, friendly, and delicious.
other Since I was in AZ area for the weekend with my gf for pleasure we decided to visit one of my friends in the area. She picked this place and we decided to get seafood instead of steak or a meat house. First of all, I'd suggest making reservations otherwise DO NOT COME HERE. We showed up at 7pm but weren't seated until 845. Good thing we ate a really good lunch otherwise I'd be starving and complaining like a baby. At least this gave us time to have a few drinks before dinner in the LARGE outdoor waiting patio area. I think it was so crowded because it was the weekend before Fat Tuesday. This place kinda reminds me of Bubba Gump or something similar. It seems fun and they do have a large bar and waiting area. We ordered alligator and frog legs as an appetizer. LOVED IT!!! We wanted the fried alligator and frog legs but the waiter absolutely loved that he worked here and HIGHLY recommended that we order it grilled instead. Since he worked here, we figured why not? I was thinking to myself that the cooks were a bit lazy and maybe they didn't want to prepare it. Lol. To my surprise, it was good as he mentioned. I have had both before but not for a few years so I was pleased. My gf ordered the crab stuffed shrimp which was really good. I ordered a  combination seafood plate which was good but not great. There are way too many things to order on the menu. A lot of fried food so if you are trying to watch your diet/weight then don't come here. I would definitely come here again but I wouldn't be in any rush. Great for a lot of people and groups, but PLEASE make RESERVATIONS.
other Excellent service and food.Very clean.Friendly folks.Beautiful patio
3 1. Good Customer Service2. Clean Atmosphere3. Good Margaritas4. YUMMIE Carna Asada Burrito
other My husband and I lucked into one of the best dining experiences in a long time on a recent business trip to AZ. The hummous appetizer was exceptional, as was the "what's in this steak?" dish, tender filet wrapped in yukon-gold potatoes (how comforting is THAT?). Nice selection of wine by the glass.  The only disappointment was a dessert referred to as a "twist on Tiramisu," but which bore no resemblance to it at all, with toffee cookie dough ice cream. I'll go back next time in town, but try a different dessert.
other This place was AWESOME!!!  My wife and I have been driving by this location for a couple years and finally decided to go in, I had a yearning for Ramen.  It did not disappoint.  We got there just before happy hour, which is always a bonus, but would still go outside of happy hour.  The menu is quite extensive, the bonus is they have Italian noodle dishes as well.  We have been told that this is authentic to Japan so I was impressed to see this in the valley, having been to many "Japanese" restaurants.We decided to try many different dishes, and were equally impressed with all.  I had the TanTan-Men, a spicy Ramen with pork, delicious.  We shared some tuna sashimi, which was fresh and tasty (looked like real pink, no added color).  We also shared the Seafood Delight roll, which has tuna, 'krab' and is topped with a scallop, fantastic.  The last thing we ordered were the Spicy Korean Ribs, this was my least favorite, but still good.  Of course the Kirin (on draft) was flowing as well as the house Saki.Overall the CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe impressed us to say the least.  We will be back to try more.  Thank you CherryBlossom, keep up the Great Work.
other I have been eating here since high school, so i can safley say bout 3other years. The food is still as good as it was when 1other of us would jump into Smitty's vw van and drive down for our 30 minuet lunch break. (West high of course) It has been owned by the same family since it opened in the early 1800's!!! Yes the cheese crisp are awesome but the tacos not the shredded beef but the regular tacos are the best in town. Order a couple they are sooo good. Love you Los.
other Amazing food. I wasn't so sure about Indian food, as visiting this place was my first time at both the restaurant and the food itself. I had the Chicken Tikki Marsala and it was fantastic. I can't wait to go back!
other Mill Ave has been missing a good breakfast nook, and it has made me very sad. Until now! The atmosphere is very modern. The color scheme is gray, orange, and black and boy do they stick to it, down to the orange frosted cupcakes. Impressive. I had the best french toast I have ever had in my life right here at NCounter. I have only eaten here once, and usually I don't give five stars out after the first visit, but this place is THAT good. So happy to have such a fabulous breakfast restaurant so close to home.
other Every time I head to ABC cake supply I see this wonderful store on the way. I often say, "I need to stop there." Today I did. It is a wonderful ecclectic store filled with unique items. From baby, wedding, kitchen and on! I picked up some of their mini cupcake stands! LOVE!!!
other I love this place!We weren't sure what to expect since the restaurant is in an office building plaza.  Kinda weird, but the employees in the other businesses are lucky!We went in here on a whim after reading all the awesome Yelp reviews.  Our first impression was a girl at the front and she was super nice and didn't rush us while we were checking out the menu options.I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with macaroni & cheese and my husband ordered the brisket sandwich with a side of baked beans.  He also ordered a side of ribs to sample.  The wait wasn't too bad -- it took about 10 or 1other minutes and it was ready to go.  They are cool with their sauce and let you fill up the small plastic cups and take as much as you want of it (which is awesome, because the sauce tastes SO good!).   It's a nice, thick sauce and they have several flavors to choose from.We go to a nearby area to have a little picnic by ourselves and notice that they forgot to include the side of ribs.  We pack everything up and go back to get those.  The employees were really nice about it and apologized and gave my husband the side of ribs.  We repeat the same process and realize that they also messed up my husband's order and gave him a pulled pork sandwich instead of the brisket sandwich.  We decide to let it go and eat our food.The pulled pork has great flavor.  The meat actually tastes like it has been smoked for several hours and is good enough to eat on its own without any sauce.  However, we weren't going that route, because the sauce is too damn good not to eat.  The baked beans and macaroni & cheese were not anything special, but they were good.  The ribs were our favorite part!  We absolutely loved them.  Very tender and the sauce they chose to slather them in was delicious.This place is pretty far from where we live, but we would definitely go out of our way (again) to eat here more.
other I've always sorta had mixed feelings about this theater. On the one hand, there aren't a whole lot of options to see independent film in AZ besides this place and Camelview, so I've got thank Dan Harkins for those outlets. On the other hand, there are times when this theater plays the SAME movie for weeks. An examples of this was with What The Bleep Do We Know?. I hate it when this place does that, but it's nice to see films here that wouldn't normally get play at Camelview (ie. Che: Parts other & 2, Let The Right One In, etc.).In all, this place is a bit like my own Cinema Paradiso because I have so many fond memories in this theater. There was a Pulp Fiction screening when I was in high school and I got to go to an advanced screening of Slumdog Millionaire and actually got to meet Danny Boyle when he showed up for a Q&A afterward. I just wish they had midnight screenings of classic/grindhouse/cult films like The New Beverly in LA.
other No, I simply cannot put in a good review for Miracle Mile. A coworker recommended this place to me. Actually, two coworkers did.However, upon inspection of my pie right before I was about to eat it, I noticed that there was mold in it.Yes, mold.Sorry Miracle Mile, your fries were bland and while your chicken tenders were decent, I can't forgive mold in a pie. I did take a picture of it so I will be adding it to this review as soon as I can.Who knows if I will get my 2.9other for moldy pie back.*ETAMM has been notified and I am to receive a gift certificate for my 2.95. I was given the option of returning it but it's over a 40 min drive.
other I love this restaurant. Very cheap, very clean, the food is sooo good. My mom and I eat there once every couple of weeks, sometimes twice once a week. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The environment is very comforting. I recommend this place to anyone who loves cheap but tasty Mexican food.
other Fun, Fast, Easy, Yummy.  Nice Flatbread style pizzaz, done right, crispy, not thick & greasy. Yummy fresh & unique toppings.  Crisp salads.  Good place for kids :-)
other Tuck Shop is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Phx. Everything is superb from the service to drinks to food to overall experience. Definitely go soon!
other The buns fall apart so you end up eating your burger with a soggy bun.  Staff does not seem to know what is going on and they are not well trained.  Can't think on their own.
3 The person before me reviewed Phoenix Greyhound Park as a Flea Market. I....will be reviewing the Greyhound Park in Dog Race form. We came here during 4th of July night, after many drinks and BBQ-ing and swimming at my relatives home. Prior to leaving to come here, it sounded like a good idea - I was comparing the dog races to the Del Mar horse races in San Diego in my head.But, during the drive, I started feeling wary. This is Arizona, and they're racing dogs in 110 degree heat? What is the constant tugging at my heartstrings? This guilt isn't working for me. The track is outdoor, while the patrons betting on these beautiful animals sit indoor in stadium seating, behind huge glass windows, watching giddily while drinking beer and eating snack bar-type foods. Admission is free. They do keep the dogs indoor before racing them. I decided I'd relent and bet on a race, then immediately felt like an asshole when they brought the dogs around for the camera and I saw them dressed in numbered garb and muzzles. I lost, but I didn't bet for the rest of the races we stayed for, it just didn't feel right.Everyone else had a good time, though, especially the winners. How can I get so excited about the horse races but not the dog races? I'm a walking contradiction.
3 I love that walking through the doors of the Sugar Bowl is like taking a step back in time but what I don't love is that it looks like it hasn't been cleaned or had any restoration work done since the day it opened. Lets be honest though, I didn't come here for the decor, I came for the ice cream. I was very excited when I saw the sundae covered in chocolate, cherries and marshmallow creme. I love marshmallow creme and chocolate, always a recipe for success when these two ingredients are combined. Well, no luck. They were out of marshmallow creme. I got a brownie sundae instead, only ate half and decided that it was only ok. I probably won't go back to this place. There are too many good dessert options out there. Though if my friends insisted, I would more than likely oblige.
other We went to Ocean Prime the other night and it was delicious.  I don't know if it was worth the money but it was definitely good.  The setting is as attractive as any restaurant I can remember, with classical contemporary decor and a very cool display of alcohol bottles in the bar.I was in a party of seven and the prevalent dish was the bone-in filet.  We had heard it was better than the steakhouses in Chicago.  Well I'm from Chicago, and trust me, you get a better (and bigger) bone-in filet at Joe's.  But it was still a delicious steak.  The sides were terrific and the salads were good too.  But those prices!  Wow, value is not this restaurant's strong suit.About the only other thing I'll add is the service was below average, a concern considering what the prices were like.  Our server tried hard but he was too slow and didn't get our order right.
other Vegan Mexican with a urban funk to it. Should it work?  I dont know. Did it work?  Not really.We walked in, it was empty quiet and after 20 seconds a surprised guy walked in and greets us. We take out seat on the purple booths and browse the menu while we sip watermelon water. Things got a bit stranger from there.The menu had many interesting options, but each one we tried to order we found out that the didn't have chips, mushrooms or chorizo, key ingredients in many of the things on the menu. We had to just ask what can we order.We ordered and waited, as the sun set it became quite dark as no one had turned on the lights. Another customer walked in but the waiter was busy working as a cook. It became even darker as we waited. The other customer finally was given a menu and the lights were turned on, however it was still pretty dark. Our tacos came, they were a bit small we each had 2.other tacos I assume the 1/other a taco to make up for the lack of chips on the side.The tacos them selves were good, nice flavors crunch etc. for $8-$9 they should be good.  However the other problem sunk in as we were leaving, we were still hungry and after $2other and 4other min we were less than happy.The next day they had posted a photo to Facebook, not about their food, or a special but look how how our waiter/cook is.   So I guess if you want to look at toned male waiter this is your spot. Otherwise there are many kinks that need to be worked out.
3 I want the Garage to do well. It is still a work in progress, though. Three of us visited two weeks ago. We were sat right next to a group of 40 - 5other year old ladies out for a surprise birthday. What's with that anyways. Do you really need to go to a somewhat small restaurant with your pack of "girls," and occupy a large swath of the dining area? Do you need all the paraphernalia (collages, centerpieces, hats)? I was seriously waiting to see a youngish birthday girl. Nope, she was the oldest. 60, easy. Act your age. While you're at it, you are not a size six anymore. Needless to say, it was loud. At least one of the revelers apologized right when we sat. As if that's any conciliation for the volume 1other cackling. First off, the Garage has good brewskis. Not a huge supply, but what they have is quality. We had wings and truffle oil deviled eggs. Both were great. I had Schriner's Sausage Flat bread, and it was great. Wife had something, I forget, and said it was good. Friend had some large salad and said it was good, too. Overall, food was better than most. So, why the three stars you ask? Service. Why do some cool places slip up on this? Is it because they hire "cool people" or friends that don't really want to work? First off, a server (we were seated at the entrance/ exit to the kitchen) dropped a glass bottle of ketchup five feet from my foot. My wife and I had splatter on our jeans and glass near our sandal clad feet. Hardly a response. We were handed a rag. Our server not so sympathetically wondered, "Oh, they almost dropped a bottle of ketchup on you." The rest of the night just seemed a little disorganized and not relaxing? Every server seemed in the weeds or confused. Empty beer and water glasses. Entrees arrived and empty app plates sat there. $60 for three for apps, dinner and beers.
3 Haus Murphy's was my first German food experience ever. The cuisine was OK but it isn't something I'd shove people down to get to. I went with a friend who lived in Germany for a bit and he said that Murphy's wasn't quite up to par. We ordered the sausage sampler as an appetizer. The sausages were tasty, but they were a bit cold. For something that is labeled a "sampler", I felt disappointed with only two types of sausages served in it. I don't know for sure what types they were, but they didn't taste unique to me, as it seems like you can purchase them in the meat section of any supermarket. The sausages were served with three types of condiments. A sweet style mustard, a Dijon style mustard, and ketchup blended with curry, which I'm told is a recent favorite of the German kids brought over from Turkish immigrants. For our entrees, we all had some type of schnitzel. That same friend told me to try the Wiener schnitzel as it is the representative item when you think of German cuisine. So all our schnitzel's came out and mine was the blandest. My friend's schnitzels had different gravies, toppings, and stuff and my poor little Wiener schnitzel was just bland and all alone. You have to get that Wiener schnitzel wet with gravy ! No biggie, I'm a foodie so I'll eat it. A schnitzel is basically German country fried pork. Not super exciting. I copied my friend who lived in Germany and substituted potatoes on the side for spatzle, as I wanted this experience to be as authentic as possible. I don't know if it's just Haus Murphy's, but the spatzle was kind of bland, even with the gravy. I do however like the word spatzle. If I ever visited Germany, I would only say spatzle, to everyone. I also liked the other thing that was served with the entree. It was kind of like a mashed potato mixed with some creme sauce, onions and some kind of green vegetable or herb (probably spinach). The beer here was good authentic German beer. I didn't get drunk, but I still don't remember what kind I had, you'll have to experiment. Service was excellent. I read some reviews that said Murphy's was slow but everything came out quickly and evenly for us. The waitress was very friendly and they spoke lovely German (not that I speak ANY German, but it sounded sexy). She was very helpful in describing everything, from the food to the beer.I ordered a BAP (big ass pretzel) to go. Philly is known for some pretty good pretzels and this BAP was good. It was expensive, but it came out warm, soft & chewy. The only thing is they went a little heavy on the salt. To steal and modify a quote from a Seinfeld episode: "That big ass pretzel made me thirsty"!  Note* They don't actually have it on the menu as a BAP.Would I return to Murphy's? Ehhh, yeah to try some of the other things, but I definitely can't see it as a place that I would be a regular at.
other Covet is an excellent clothing store.In Arizona, there is almost nowhere decent to shop. unless of course you loooooove Juicy Couture, in the event of which, you should probably not even bother reading this review, because this kind of fashion forward clothing won't appeal to you. Acne Jeans? check.Endovenera? check.Ksubi? check. Nike? check. Covet starts off with an excellent men's shoe section, continues with an excellent men's clothing selection, and finishes off with excellent women's wear. It really is a shame if you haven't been to Covet yet. Do yourself a  serious favor and support a small business at the same time.
other On my second week receiving a small mixed box for Nature's Garden and LOVE it!  It is more than enough for my fiance and I.  It is the easiest way to get fresh, organic, and local produce, especially since it is delivered right to my door.  It helps learn what is in season and how to make great new recipes!
other This is probably one of the more unique, trendy looking places in Phoenix-metro to lounge at.  Everything about AZ88 is eye-candy, literally., from the furniture to the drinks to the decor and of course, the patrons.  Drinks are made really, really tasty.  My usual choice of cocktail is the French 75.  My go-to appetizer is either the waffle fries that comes with three flavorful dipping sauces or the shrimp ceviche! The menu is pretty diverse with a little flair.What makes this place a hit for me are the contemporary, artsy decor making it a refreshing scene to come to compared to other Phoenix-ish ambiance.  Of course, you can't have all these modern, sophisticated attributes without a DJ playing fresh beats and sounds! Bottom line is the look and the vibe makes me feel like I am back in New York or Los Angeles.  I had given a 4-star prior, but I can honestly say AZ88 can hang with the big boys.
other I actually have grown to love this little place. Their coffee is good; their breakfast burritos are absolute heaven. Made with provolone cheese, these burritos have a more mellow and sophisticated taste than the average breakfast burrito you'll find drowned in yellow cheese.You can get a Big Ass Burrito, or a Half Ass Burrito. Personally, I don't like to do anything "half-assed", so I opt for the Big Ass Burrito that, although adds circumference to MY big ass, is soooo worth it in the morning when you want a laid back spot to enjoy your meal and coffee (go for the iced).They also have an art exhibit /sale right now for the month of September with awesome aviation pictures printed on canvas. Amazing art to enjoy as you sip your coffee.
other I stayed here last month. It's your average motel (since the doors face outside, not a hallway), and the breakfast buffet is okay (scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage links, bacon, cereal, batter to make waffles,   and toast provided). The walls are REALLY thin, so thin that the guy snoring next door kept us awake all night. The room was clean and equipped with a mini fridge (like the kind you'd keep in your dorm room) and microwave, although lacking a safety deposit box. If you want to keep your items safe, you have to bring your items to the front desk, make a list of what you're dropping off, and then sign. I was uncomfortable making a list, so I decided to forgo this process.FYI if you call the front desk to order you a taxi, they actually order a car service. The car is an unmarked, dark-colored Lincoln sedan. To go to the 16th Street Sports Bar down the street cost us about $10 vs $6 for an actual taxi (which we ended up taking later). We didn't want to drink and drive, so not bad, but just know that the hotels in the area do not order taxis.My main complaint is that we didn't have housekeeping service the entire time, hence the two stars. We left for lunch from 10:30AM - 1:30PM, returned, but housekeeping never arrived. We left again at 3PM for the rest of the day, and housekeeping, upon arrival back at the room after midnight, hadn't come. I called the front desk for someone to bring towels, but since there was no one to cover the front desk, we had to go get the towels ourselves. I also wanted an extra pillow, but the front desk person couldn't leave the front desk to get a pillow out of the housekeeping room. I thought this was very strange.I guess for less than $100/night (Hilton resort down the street much more expensive), it's not too bad. I would probably stay here again for the mere fact that the location is conducing to our activities. But, if I could find another hotel close by with a similar price, I wouldn't mind staying somewhere else.
3 Descent food, of course it's not autentico. Free chips, salsa, & wifi though.
other This location is clean and efficient.  Our waitress was awesome and had our order in and food out VERY quickly.  The food is all fantastic and of good quality.
3 I usually get the Arizona Smashchicken or the Arizona Cobb Salad.  Both are always delicious!  Sometimes they are really spicy and other times not so much.  I guess it depends on who is making it and how many jalapenos get in there.   The chicken is really flavorful, unlike a lot of other chicken sandwiches/salads where the chicken is bland and adds nothing to the meal.  I think I am the only person I know that isn't a fan of the Smashfries.  They are generally tasty, but I would far prefer regular fries.  I really like this place, but its a little pricey for what you get.  Lunch for two will probably set you back a least $20... its not too bad, but your $20 will go a lot further other places.
other I want to preface this review by saying that I'm close friends with one of the sushi chef's in training, so we got a seat right at the sushi bar and really had a great opportunity to chat.  That being said, I will review this strictly on the quality of food, since we received some deep discounts due to being VIP guests.  (C'mon now, you know you all get discounts too when you personally know the staff/chefs, so quit your whinin'!)The quality of the fish was excellent... some of the best sushi I've had in my existence.  The key to getting good sushi is to trust in the chef, and ask them what is fresh, and what they would suggest (omakase style).  We had a sashimi appetizer platter to start which featured blue fin, yellow tail, o-toro (yes, the good stuff!), and a few other pieces.  Served with fresh wasabi root (not the hydrated green powdery stuff), this appetizer really woke our stomachs and senses.We had a few different rolls per the chef's suggestion, and all were spectacular (including some off the menu rolls).  The kim bap roll was highly recommended, and the quality was definitely memorable, better than most Korean-mom kim bop rolls I've had in my life.We asked for ama-ebi (sweet shrimp), which was soft, tender, and sweet, with perfectly fried shrimp head to back.  This was the first time I've had such perfectly made ama-ebi, and it's made me want to continue my search in Chicago.Some tasty mochi desserts, a few bottle of sake, and all in all, it was a very enjoyable night for my compadres and I.  I'm sorry for those that have found a bad experience at Otaku, as it sounds like most of it is waitstaff issues... but as a sushi fanatic, my advice to you is this:1.  Don't ask for a table if you're party is smaller than 4... ask for a spot at the sushi counter, because that's how sushi is meant to be served.  Getting to know your chef, the chef getting to know you, having drinks together, etc.  2.  Ask the chef what he/she recommends.  Not all fish are equally fresh, and the chef will know what's best for the day.  And if you can provide them with your own past experience of what you liked/didn't like, they'll likely craft a sushi experience for you that you'll love.Verdict:  If only Otaku were in Chicago... I might go broke.  Delicious sushi, and worth a visit!
3 Okay, so I like Canteen and all, but dear Lord, let's turn that music down a notch! These guys have a great happy hour, but I realistically wouldn't come here if it weren't for that. I quite enjoy the small bites' baby back ribs - the portions are so small, but since they are half price during happy hour, I get two orders! I'm not a big fan of Tequila, but I know they have a big selection (obviously). I really like the atmosphere here, and the service has always been good. I may or may not come back, but we'll see. Three solid stars from me.
other This is one of those places that I always seem to forget to review.  I guess maybe because it seems everyone already knows this place is great!!The important details you need to know:- Live music sometimes- Great happy hour food specials- Most wines (3/other of the wine list) is $other a glass before 6pm.  Use your Yelp check-in offer to drop that to $3.  YES I SAID THREE DOLLARS!!!!!!- Great bruschetta, burgers, and everything else. Chef's specials are often enough vegetarian so that's nice for someone like me- Great back patio that isn't super obvious to a first-timer that it exists- Clean bathrooms! You know all of the above doesn't matter in the slightest bit if the restrooms are nasty- Wine specials on the 5th of every month.  Now, I have never participated but I think it's like $other for a specific wine. But since you can use the Yelp check-in offer, I haven't bothered since it's cah-razy cheap every day!!
other This review is mainly for the bar and a few light (ok not light, but small) snacks.  Met with a couple people during their soft opening and there was absolutely nothing soft about it.  I got there a few minutes early and posted up at the bar to grab a Manhattan.  This drink is usually my boozometer when I am trying a place first.  Ok, we've got something here, this drink is tasty.  Started talking to the bartenders and got a really comfortable feeling from them.  When was the last time that you sit down to the bar and  they ask your name, tell you their's, and then shake your hand?  After the manhattan the rest of the group showed.  The bar was a little too busy to fit the three of us so I took my second drink, sazerac, to the table.  Sazerac was tasty as well.  Rest of the table ordered some drinks and nothing negative to be said anywhere.  We each had around other or other drinks and every last one of them was delicious.  We were comped a few bar snack and all were delicious but the stand out was the warm nuts. (twss)  Mixed nuts warmed with Herbs De Provence and a little bit of chili flake I believe.  Soooooo good.  As for the style of the place it is fantastic.  Feels cool but not cliche.  The Palomar staff did a fantastic job of designing this space.  As of now this is the one place in City Scape that is worth while.
3 This place wasn't quite up to scratch for me. I had the foie gras sandwich.  It was pretty good, but I was still ravenous $10 later, so I top it off with a chocolate croissant ($2.75) which was also good.  Definitely a cute space with above average dishes.  But in the end there just wasn't enough bangs for my bucks.
3 I enjoy "the BOP" as my friend calls it on the same level that I enjoy pizza.  It's good, but it's not my desert island bar.  I go here to meet up with friends.  I've never been there on my own because let's face it.  I'm not likely to be caught dead trolling Scottsdale (even non-Scottsdale Scottsdale) by my lonesome.  The atmosphere is cozy and inviting.  Which kinda turns me off. I like my bars a bit seedier.  But if that's your thing then I'm cool with it.  I hear the food is pretty good for English fare, but hey who wants to waste time eating when you could be drinking?
other Surprisingly I had a blast at this place last night! For a club it is a bit on the small side, but other than that it is pretty nice. It was a Monday night(watching a DJ spin) so it was not jam packed; i am sure the weekends can be a bit ridiculous in here. I am not sure what I think about the voyeuristic bedroom that overlooks the dancefloor...meaning from the dancefloor you can look up at a staged bedroom (looks like a VS fitting room), where a chic pretends to put on make-up, write in her diary, lay around in bed, etc. while wearing lingerie. It is definitely entertaining for sure! I wonder how much those ladies get paid to 'do what they do' up there!!??  Anyway, they also have body painted 'topless' cocktail waitresses, which I'm sure the men love. If you are a bit of a prude this is probably not the joint for you. I am sure this place pulls in lots of Scottsdale's finest douchebagery and fembots, but I cannot deny I had a pretty rad time there on an 'off' night! I danced till the lights came on (along with many others) and I haven't done that in a while! The service was great and the drinks were well poured...did I mention the bartender wasn't too shabby to look at either ;) Whether male or female, it is not too hard to find something tantalizing at the PCL!
other great sports bar. TV's galore. Good food. Outside patio. While many places claim to be sports bars, for some reason they wind up not paying attention to the TV's and wind up with hair removal infomercials playing.This place knows what they are doing with the tv's. I was watching the manager who looked like had a spreadsheet with every game planned out and on what tv's. They also play the sound from the premier game.
other This would be a great place to live at
other Sprinkles has amazing cupcakes! The cake is always moist and the frosting delicious. I have had cupcakes from other bakeries where they pipe the frosting on using a pastry bag, and there is wayyyyyy too much frosting. Sprinkles does it by hand, so the frosting amount is always perfect for the cake size. I love the simple decorations they use as well.The only downside I have noticed is that they use a lot of oil, and if the cupcake is touching the box the oil will actually seep through the cardboard. But I guess it's the price you pay for extremely moist cupcakes! Also, the frosting is super sweet and it sometimes makes my teeth hurt. It's so worth it though!My favorite flavor ever is Chai Latte! They only have them on Fridays though, and they often run out before dinner, so get there early if you want one!They also have amazing seasonal flavors: salty caramel, dark chocolate raspberry, eggnog spice, chocolate peppermint, and the best: brown sugar praline! That one is an Easter flavor and I love the crunch of the praline combined with the brown sugar! YUM!Yes, it is a bit pricey, but if you like the "Sprinkles Cupcakes" and "Sprinkles Cupcakes Scottsdale" Facebook pages they each do a daily whisper word that will get the first 50 people a free cupcake! I always try to buy another cupcake when I use them, so it's about $other a cupcake then. Many times the whisper word will get you an off-the-menu cupcake, either a seasonal offering from a different part of the year or a cupcake creation. I had a lemon cake with strawberry frosting once, and it tasted like strawberry lemonade...delicious!
other Best donuts I have ever had.
other Consistency every time i return in quality of ingredients, service and taste of food!  how nice that one of the owners recognizes you and comes over to greet you.  the friendly staff behind the counter and nice girls who wait on you when you come to dine in add to the positivity.  my favorite dessert is the yogurt with fresh granola and fruit.  i wish this place were open a bit longer. i've had most of the entrees, loving the duck salad with the sauce, the fresh greens taste like it's gone from field to plate in the same day.i'll happily give this quaint bistro other stars if they stay open longer hours. i feel like this is scottsdale's best kept secret.
other if you like terrible service and overpriced food you've come to the right place.  If I knew before I went in there I would be paying $16.00 for macaroni and cheese, and had the pleasure of waiting around for an hour to get it, while my glass remained empty, I would've stayed away (which is what you should do).  Food wasn't awful, although other members of the party did cut up their mouths eating the hard as a "Rock" bread on their sandwiches. The mac n' cheese was nothing special.  The service was beyond poor.  First and last time I will eat at Hard Rock Cafe.
other I went to Arriba last night with my wife and another couple.  I have been to this location a handful of times and always had the same result.  The food was okay but the main problem here is the super slow service. It took us nearly two hours to eat dinner here.  It took forever to get our chips and salsa.  It took us nearly as long to get our drinks.  Forget about refills.    When our food finally arrived we asked for an additional plate but never got it.  I asked for a water when our food came out and got it after I was 3/other done with my meal...and I do not eat fast.  Our waiter was friendly but hardly ever checked in with us.  When we asked for the check he said he would bring it in five minutes.  His five minute deadline was not met.I don't think I will be eating here again.  I have given them too many chances.
other The shopping center this Rack is located in is absolute poison to my pocketbook. TJ Maxx, Ross and Nordstrom Rack all in a tidy row? Rock on! There are great deals to be found here with patient and selective hunting like any other discount retailer, and that these great deals are on brands which Nordstrom's carries makes any awesome deal so very much sweeter. Don't go expecting to strike gold at every visit, or expecting Ross prices on Guess shoes, and you will fall in love with the store.
other We went to check out PNP for their other Year Anniversary show and were extremely impressed!  Space 5other is the most charming space that I never would've known existed had it not been for this show being promoted on Yelp!  The actors were amazing and we really were in awe the entire time we watched this 30 minute film being created right in front of us!  I'd heard of Comedy Improv, but Movie Improv?  I had no clue... Special shout outs to Mark J and Jenn H (our very own Phoenix yelpers) who did an incredible job on Saturday night.  Congrats again, PNP, on your other year anniversary!  I look forward to attending future performances for sure!
other We keep coming back! I love this place. The food is always so good and even when I ask the kitchen for the naked cheeseburger, they make it pretty. And its delish and I love me a cheeseburger. This last time I ordered a vodka tonic and asked the bartender to surprise me - either Belvedere or Ketel. Back came the most frosty delicious Belvedere vodka tonic. Perf. The lovely, as prefers, mans up to the filet. And is always happy, sipping his pinot alongside.. I just wanted to say, yum. And we'll keep coming back. Thanks PCG.
other They try to be like In-N-Out, even down to the color scheme, but the burgers taste very different.  They offer cajun fries which have some extra seasoning, and if you ask for your fries "well done" they don't come out as soggy.  But if you're going with someone else, then one order of fries is all you'll need.  They give everyone huge helpings of fries and I'm never able to finish a single order so I just share it.  The burgers are excellent and the one thing that sets this place a part is the option to get fresh jalapenos on your burger.  Don't forget about breakfast!  This is where In-N-Out fails.  The breakfast burgers are great after a night of partying.
other I love the lakes!  Yes it's a lake in the desert!  Dragon Boat, Outrigger, and Marathons!  It's the place to do it.  Not sure about the fishing part, but I do see people fishing there.  What are they trying to catch hmmm??  I enjoy running there on a nightly basis and so should you.  South side is probably the most scenic, but not to say the North side is bad.  If you're a fellow photographer I would definitely recommend this place during the evenings :)
other I expected better.The ambiance is pleasant.  It's lit well and the furniture is very new.  The booth was comfortable.   The bar appears to be a little dark and moody, but in a sultry way.We were there on the Sunday before Labor Day, around 7 PM and it wasn't busy at all.  Maybe 8 patrons besides us.  We were seated right away in a booth.  The waiter was very quick to take our order and explained the specials.  For the appetizer we ordered the cheese, fruit and crackers.  They "ran out" of crackers and gave us toasted bread soaked in butter instead.  We asked if we could have dry bread instead.  They obliged.  There were 3 pieces of cheese, all of which were the same and brie.  Seriously, please diversify the cheese plate with more than other type of cheese.  And have crackers to go with it, since t's on the menu description.My girlfriend and I both ordered a quarter chicken.  I had the true jerk sauce and she had the honey truffle sauce.  The chicken quality was on par with Boston Market or Costco, maybe even fattier.  We were seriously unimpressed.  The sauces were good, but definitely did not blow your socks off.You get to choose two sides along with your chicken.  I had zucchini and whipped potatoes.  The whipped potatoes come with your choice of three ingredients from a list of 1other or so.  Horseradish, garlic and mesquite sour cream were my choices.  The potatoes were excellent, both zesty and filling.Overall, I was unimpressed.  This place is like an upscale Boston Market where the chicken is lower quality and the only improvement is in the quality of the sides.  The sauces are good, but you can do much better.
other This dry-rub barbecue was delicious. The "sassy" barbecue sauce was meh, but the sweet was good enough to make up for it.
other We went here after the Rainbow Festival and it was such a great place! The food was great, the service was awesome and the patio is a great place to enjoy your meal! Bliss has made it to my list of places to eat downtown!
other I like this Sam's. I get my eye exams/contacts/glasses here and some groceries. It's almost always pretty dead and therefore easy to get in and out quickly and easily. They don't have nearly the selection that most Costco do, but I've never waited in line here.
other Why can't the attendant understand a simple direct question?Can someone please tell me just where the Hell I'm supposed to put my freakin' drink?and worst of all ... my balls don't fit in this place.*one extra star for the bartender offering me her personal lighter *minus the extra star for not having any matches
other Oh....my 2am delivery staple.Their "til 3am delivery" feature is one of the beauties of Silver Mine. Their sandwiches are always fresh and these people are fast. The Dodge City w/ a side of chili is my go to. So, so good.
other As I mentioned in my previous review, Maizie's was my favorite spot with the first Urban Wine Walk.  So it makes perfect sense that if the UWW Returns, so do I.  Well, return to Maizie's that is!  We started there this time and enjoyed all three wines they were tasting.  Their pizza and bruschetta bites were great.  And after we quickly inhaled the samples, we decided to get more food.  The menu is pretty huge and everything sounded and looked delicious.  Yes, we were eyeing everybody else's plate as well; the bar seats are good for that!  After ooh-ing and ah-ing over what we saw, we decided to split the spinach and artichoke dip that came with chips and pit bread.  It was great!The best part about Maizie's is that they just seem to do things right.  Friendly, casual service so you feel like you're among friends.  All sorts of specials listed up on the boards so 1) you don't have to feel dumb asking and 2) you don't have to feel even dumber when you forget and have to ask again.  Beer of the month (always fun to try), 20% off beer or wine to-go (what is this, Vegas?), happy hour specials (you had me at "daily"), the list goes on and on.Good food, great energy, small, cozy inside and an nice patio space too.  I have only been twice now, but have have fabulous experiences each time.  A few more times, and they win the fifth star, easy!!
other I've eaten here many times, but none as bad as last night.Service was excellent, and highly attentive.Food, absolutely horrible.My expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood. After all, they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye. What I was hoping for was a 1- 1-1/2' thick steak, cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered. What I got a a 3/other in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat, gristle, and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style. Salad, similar to something you could get at Chick FiletVeggies, blah.Bread basket, ample, but day old, and if not, it certainly wasn't fresh. In addition to bad food, we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables, listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye, and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French, until the waiter showed up, then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English. I've had it with this place.If I'm going to pay 150 bucks for dinner, it'll be at Mortons, or Maestro where the steaks are 1-1/other in thick, cooked to perfection, and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristle
other Good food, good service!  We go here a lot!
other Standing like a paragon of virtue in a sea of decadence, U.S. Egg's Scottsdale's location is place of redemption, both for your soul and your appetite. Open only for breakfast and lunch, the restaurant attracts as diverse a clientele as the 'dale itself. This is not somewhere that relies on being a tourist trap: some locals are known to eat here daily.Its location is slightly outside the Old Town Pale, but still within walking distance unless it's the height of summer. Secondly, it has its own parking lot, making it as accessible as Denny's or a Marie Callendars. Nevertheless the lot is often full on weekend mornings, and you will definitely see people waiting. unless you arrive very early or late. There is both an outdoor patio seating area and a large indoor dining room.Having gone numerous times alone, I am always impressed how quickly I am seated. No bias against tables for one here. The servers are all personable and graceful...yet not self-aggrandizing. This is not a Michelin four-star restaurant however, and you should not expect being waited on hand and foot. Given the volume of service, it's also commendable how few mistakes are made and how prompt everything is.The food is also excellent. Although you can order both lunch or breakfast, I tend to crave the latter more. There's plenty of variety on the menu and they have both innovative dishes and old staples. This helps to explain why the uber-fab Scottsdale club kids patronize this place just as much as the Cadillac set. Prices are very reasonable for Scottsdale, though perhaps too much for a dirt-poor college student or person living only on Social Security.The building also capitalizes on Arizona's sunny weather with high ceilings and plenty of windows...causing plenty of light to splash in and helping to evoke that sense of morning and freshness. There's plenty of ambient noise as a result...but it's almost reassuring. Not to mention that the hearing-aid crowd and club crawlers may be too deaf to notice.U.S. Egg is not flawless, however. From a cost point of view, the restaurant has to contend with the fact that breakfast is usually the cheapest meal of the day. Without a dinner menu though to recoup cost, diners have to grin and bear any perceived cost imbalance from say  Denny's. Neverthless it's still worth it, in my opinion. The other shortcoming stems from the food. Different dishes often rely on the same sides. If you get sick of their potatoes for example, you can be really out of luck despite ordering something different every time. Moreover their signature dishes again may not impress truly demandng foodies.While it may not cure your hangover (or incontinence), U.S. Egg remains firmly on the map for locals. Managing to please all of Scottsdale is a tall order, and the owners, managers, and staff all should stand tall and be proud.
other Update:   They now have Coors and Miller Lite on draft.  Yay!  They're a real bar again.  I don't know the drama, but apparently the management has been "let go" and the owner is now managing the place.
other Chuy's is one of those places that doesn't quite qualify as a dive bar/restaurant, but is close enough to count.  I like Chuy's.  It's like a mini-vacation every time you go.  Part beach bar, part pseudo-tiki (any place that has thatch palm fronds above the bar gets a star in my book!), you'll feel like you're on a beach somewhere every time you visit.  It's nice to have one within walking distance to the office, to allow for a little exercise to and from and still have a good meal.  Their prices are reasonable.  I've been struggling to find a lunch under $10 these days, and the Tri-tip sandwich and an iced tea will set you back a ten spot and some change.  The food is good, did I mention that?  The staff is friendly, and they finally did away with the cheap-o' paper towels and put real napkin dispensers on each table...FTW!  There's an unlimited chips and salsa bar, I like the cabo sauce the best for my chips.  I always add a little Baja sauce; you have to ask for it at the counter, to whatever I'm enjoying.  Today it happened to be the Tri-tip sandwich.  I give it other out of other stars because even though they have to-go cups, this is Phoenix.  It is 108* outside and the full glass of iced tea I left the restaurant with was gone by the time I got back to the office.  There should be a City-wide ordinance that all restaurants must supply patrons with at least a 3other oz. to-go cup during working hours.  All right, I confess that might be a little much.  The only down-side to Chuy's at lunch I've found so far is having to go back to work afterwards and not being able to enjoy a Corona with my lunch.  That's okay though, it just one more reason to go back.
other So the food at this place is good. Well the sliced turkey sud. But when it came to delivery and internet ordering. Oh my god the incompetence of these people. After and hour, 1other mins after the food was suppose to be delivered (the order was other turkey subs and garlic cheese bread.) I called and was told that there was no delivery guy and if i can come pick it up that they would knock off 25%. But the foods not ready yet, how long does it take to make other subs. So i pick up the goods and damned if i didn't check the bag they didn't give me the 2nd sub. Ugh they never checked the order. If you have online ordering  you need to follow though. So with a second phone call and a second trip to the place and other hrs after the original order i FINALLY get home and eat. The only good thing i got was a free lunch.  For that I give them a 1
3 I went out here tonight with a couple of clients.  I had heard some good things about it, and they were from back East, so I thought to myself, "why not?"  I must admit I was not that impressed with it all.We came here for dinner.  Started out with some apps, and ordered the Monster Platter.  Complete with "sliders" on it that rivaled a Jumbo Jack for shear size, this could easily feed a family of four for a week.  Thank God there were 10 of us.  Most everyone ordered steak for dinner, and most were impressed.  I, on the other hand, was not that impressed.  All I could taste on my steak was butter, not meat.  I almost had to reach for the Aother Sauce, a cardinal sin in my mind with steak, just to make it edible.Since we all had a round of golf in the morning, none of us opted for the giant 3-liter beer option they had.  But the booze selection, including wine, was quite impressive.  Service all around was very attentive.  And for those of you that love your barely-18 and barely-100lbs servers that Scottsdale is serving up on a daily basis, this is a great place for you.There were a few people in our group that opted for the bull ride, a nice little touch that gave this place that little something extra to set it apart from the other Old Town places.  All things considered, I don't think I'd head back here.  I can get a better steak at a Chili's-type place, and the atmosphere (comprised mainly of your younger Scottsdale-types) didn't really do all that much for me.A couple other things of note:  their happy hour only goes until 6:30 (boo!!) but they do have a daily brunch that, strictly reading off the menu, did not look half bad.  I may have to check that out some day.
other Having been to Dave & Buster's in California, I was pleased to see one nearby in Phoenix.  Our family enjoys the games and food offered at D&B's.  It's not the best bar food you ever had, but it's alright.Some of our favorite dishes...Chicken Sandwich & Frieshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f2z4RM_ungk_zQwcpZcpcQ?select=pL9gMcMhSu66djzRs0EE0gSliders, Wings, & Frieshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f2z4RM_ungk_zQwcpZcpcQ?select=duqkD08yPYfZzK2BdwXSOwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f2z4RM_ungk_zQwcpZcpcQ?select=gmI2y1_o4YxyNsuhu4-PGAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f2z4RM_ungk_zQwcpZcpcQ?select=-SYnpluFm_tcBObKnYpR1wChicken Sandwich w/Bacon & Sweet Potato Frieshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f2z4RM_ungk_zQwcpZcpcQ?select=EkZL6PdNv4kkgopmT6IK8gBesides the video games, my Son and I enjoy shooting pool on their championship size (9 ft) pool tables.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f2z4RM_ungk_zQwcpZcpcQ?select=_L7O1ZhQ9EDnO1LHv9b10ghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f2z4RM_ungk_zQwcpZcpcQ?select=6IveT3g9EW-lLEjwbrblZQOverall, it's one of our favorite places to go where the entire family can enjoy a night out.  They serve alcohol at the bar and restaurant, so the adults can enjoy themselves while the kiddos play games, bowl, shoot pool.Return Factor - 100%
other What else can I say that hasn't been said already?  I'm weirdly glad that they're not closer ( in fact very far away from me) because I'll be there every day = gaining tons of weight!My baby loved the mango lassi flavor! So much he did the sign for "more " for the first time at the store:)I do want to try the bacon flavor....so a trip soon is in order
other I was at The Rhythm Room and saw these cool people selling Tacos, so I checked it out. It turned out to effen awesome. Fresh quality food!  ChiChi- lisous! Be on the look out for these guys! Chow down baby.
other Sakana is one of my two favorite neighborhood sushi joints. I love their calamari salad (although the one at this location is considerably smaller than the one on 59th ave) and agedashi tofu. The waitstaff is friendly and their bday song is always fun! Insider's tip: ask for some real wasabi!
other Oh AJ's...  How do I love thee...  Let me count the ways (BEERS)... 1...2...3...200!They have so many different beers to choose from here.  If you ever need an ingredient that is out of the norm they will have it.  If you ever need an ingredient for a special dinner that MUST be fresh and ripe, this is the place.From 10 differnt types of flower, 1other different brands of pasta, to 20 different types of EVOO, if you're making a really great dinner, spend the extra couple of bucks and get your stuff here.One day I'll be able to afford the prime steaks.
other The Roaring Fork is one of my very favorite restaurants.  I am not a big fan of the environment, particularly the patio and back rooms, but the food more than makes up for it.  The pork green chili served with warm tortillas is dreamy.  I also adore the huckleberry margaritas.  Can't go wrong.
other I was here for a conference and saw their sign for a $10 lunch special which wasn't available that day.  Took over an hour to just get a lunch salad.  The waiter had major attitude.Avoid this place!
other The Sushi was fab!!  We had some specialty rolls and Shashimi, both were very melt in your mouth fresh!Service was a bit slow as I think they only had other waitresses for the entire place.Cost seemed to be very reasonable.Would certainly make the drive from South Scottsdale there again!
other I am not a big beer drinker, so I can't attest to the many different options they have in that area, but I can tell you about their martinis.They have a huge menu of specialty martinis and other cocktails that are all pretty darn tasty if you ask me.  My friend really liked the chocolate something or other martini, I had a pear one that was delicious and another pal really enjoyed the pomegranate press.The food is pretty good or I was buzzed.  Or both.  We had the cheese pizza and an onion ring tower (both half-off for happy hour).  Which, by the way, truly is a tower of onion rings.  And then the waitress brought out a free piece of cheesecake for my birthday.  It was a great time had by all. But the best thing about Yard House is the location.  It's right by Kona and Z Tejas and if you start right at 3pm, you can hit happy hour at each location and then take the free trolley to Giligin's. Yes, I did this on Friday and it was TONS of fun. Try it.
3 Ok, so, I finally ate at Wanda's.  It is located right near the Chandler Harley Davidson, and its alright.  The seating is really intimate, and rather small.  The largest table in this place is for seating of 4. I didnt care for how small it was, in regards to limited seating.  They do have outdoor seating, but again, they lost points with me for only having tables for either other or 4.  What I DO like about it, is that the service was quick, and its not the usual chain resturants like IHOP or Waffle house.  Limited menu, only open a few hours a day (like 7-3) and primarily have a breakfast and lunch menu.
other Beer Selection 10/10 however service is 1/10. Staff lacks product knowledge. Specials are not mentioned. Wait time is long. Staff makes you feel like they are doing you a favor by taking your order.
other This little joint is right down the street from my crib and I've had the chance to dine here on several occasions (take out and dine in). Each and every time its been great! Extremely fresh ingredients and even better prices!! Great local place to get some great grub on a small budget. Highly recommended!
other I have past this place a million times and always wanted to stop and I finally did. It was good. The only thing that was fabulous was the cheese crisp. It was actually crispy must places its just a soft tortilla with cheese, I can do that in my own microwave. I didn't have the refried beans but they looked watery and not so good. I enjoyed this place and will come back but besides the cheeses crisp it was average but good.
other I went to this place once and the owner tried to sell me a large box, for shipping a guitar, for 30 dollars! My Wife has been in there before, and the Dude is really surly, terse & laconic. He has hired some youngsters who seem friendly and helpful- Had to pick up a fax from an insurance agent there recently- But, I wouldn't go out of my way to do any business there!
other Possibly the creepiest convenience store I have ever been to.  I mean, it's sandwiched between a strip mall and a giant dirt lot.
other ME:    Of course I want to go to an Asian Topless bar.  Are you feeling ok Ash...I thought you hated topless bars?  AND ASIAN NONETHELESS....I never expected that from you!ASH:    Shut up...I said Asian TAPAS Bar! Not TOPLESS.ME: Damn!Darn my luck...a guy never gets to have any fun!!! It wasn't what I expected...but I was not disappointed.  It was great.The place was hip.  The staff was friendly.  The food was incredible.  The bill...well the bill was a bit high.  But overall it was a great experience.  We started snapping pics through dinner.  This motivated the Exec Chef and Owner lady to come sit next to us at the bar.  I felt kind of bad for drawing attention because the owner lady became very controlling with the staff and I was a bit uncomfortable for them.But overall...I would say this place is aw aw awesome.  Try it. Have a cocktail.  Eat some Tapas. Have some fun. Don't expect anyone to be topless though :-(
other This is tough, because I REALLY wanted to like this place! What killed it for me? The lack of professionalism that was presented when my fiance and I came to look at this venue. I will admit that we were 10 minutes late to our appointment, however I do not think this warrants being treated like a herd of cattle.First when I called the venue to make an appointment whoever picked up the line sounded as if they were in a rush and not even interested in making the appointment which was the first turn off. Upon arrival, we walked into another entrance thinking it was the main entrance, then we were re-directed by an employee to the adjacent door. As we walked out there was (I don't even remember her name), the wedding coordinator waiting. She quickly greeted us then had us sit down as she began to talk about the venue. Usually when you want to sell the venue you run, you'd think you would see someone with a little enthusiasm and fire explaining why their venue is so amazing. Well, we didn't get that from this individual. What did we get? A quick 10 minute spiel about what they do and the services provided and 3 wedding books shoved in our faces as examples then a quick 10 minute tour of the place. That's it, no effort, no emotion, no interest in wanting to get to 'know us' and get a feel for what kind of wedding we would like to have, just a quick, here is the place, goodbye. She was very snooty and acted as if she was not in the mood to showcase the venue.So why two stars instead of zero? One star is for the venue itself. It is very chic, modern, yet elegant. The reception area is beautifully decorated and where the ceremony is held is beautiful as well! There are many ways one can decorate this place! The other star is the PRICE. This venue offers all inclusive packages at unbeatable prices. I mean an all inclusive package where they provide virtually everything for roughly 100 guests is $9495.00 taxes and gratuity included!!! That's a steal, trust me, I've looked into a TON of venues, you will not find an all inclusive price as cheap as this. Honestly, if my fiance and I were the only individuals funding our wedding, then we probably would have considered this place (more than likely, VEGAS). However, given the type of customer service that was displayed, we took our business elsewhere.
other We enrolled our son in this program. It was EXCELLENT! Of our three children who have learned to drive we have observed that he is the most safety conscious and the best "new" licensed driver.Thank you, Driving MBA, for the peace of mind you have given us.
other this place rules, plain and simplejust wish they had a cheaper jukebox
3 So, going on Christmas, always a risk. There was a wait and other parties in front of my group left. There we people waiting for their pick up order for over 20 minutes. But when we asked how long it would be until we got sat and would have our food we were told 1other minutes. He was true to his word on that.  The food was good. The egg rolls were awesome. We didn't really have a waiter tending to us, but that was ok. the bus person got us more water when we asked. I would probably go here again if I was in the area, but I would just as soon have the Panda.
other I'm  going to stop being such a taker, and give for once! I use Yelp along with other reputable websites to help make my dining, travel and shopping decisions and I never take the time to give back!! I know, I know....awful. I'm turning over a new leaf! Here is my first Yelp. Please don't judge. It's my first time.... Okay, here goes. So, I went to Matt's for the first time a few days ago....Food- Amazing.  Best pancakes ever! I'm not sure what the secret ingredient is but they are beyond good! Fluffy little cakes of love. I also tasted the butter burger. Very, very, yummy. If you decide to dine here make sure you try the bacon. I don't think I've ever tasted anything like it. Sweet, savory and cooked just right.The building is very small, the wait is extra long and make sure you don't overindulge on the free refills of ice tea because there is NO BATHROOM!! The seating is cramped and the service is rushed, but the food is worth dealing with Matt's shortcomings.
other Via Delosantos is one of the few places in Phoenix that a vegetarian can get a good Mexican meal.  Neither the beans or rice are cooked in lard, which is hard to find in this town.  The chips and salsa are premium, just watch out for the fried potatoes and such - very greasy.Thanks to Philip's illuminating review, I hadn't heard about their health code violations.  It's something I'll keep an eye on in the future though... if they take another dive like they did in 200other I'll keep my distance for a while.
other Everytime I think of Chodang my mouth waters. I love the spicy tofu soup they serve here along with their korean style dumplings. Their portions are just right. If you don't like spicy foods you can tell them to not make it spicy. I also love the condiments they serve before the meal. Love it!I like their decor. The tables and walls really go together and you definitely feel like you're at an asian restaurant. Everything is neat and clean (even the bathrooms).
other I think it was the guitar playing chicken that caught my eye as I drove by.  Then it was the "Now Open" sign.  New business?  Figured I had to try it.Rock-n-Roll Fingers is a SO cool concept.  Chicken fingers, waffle fries and Texas toast - that's pretty much the menu.  The Chicken fingers may be fried or Buffalo style - but they definitely won't be from frozen chicken.  They use only fresh Chicken breasts - no skin and no bones -  and they fry only in Canola oil to make for the least unhealthy fried chicken they can.  They have about 7 different dipping sauces - from Ranch to Thai sweet chili  - though they are known for their Special Sauce.  It's a secret recipe, so of course I had to try it.  Pretty dang good.  I also loved the BBQ which was more tangy than sweet and went perfect with the chicken.  As for the chicken - have you ever had chicken so juicy that you though it might not be fully cooked?  Maybe it's just because I grew up eating overcooked food, but every once in awhile when I get chicken cooked so perfectly I have to look to make sure it isn't pink.  It was SO juicy I was really shocked.  And though fried, it wasn't a thick and overly crispy batter - just enough to seal in the juices while leaving you with a tender and flexible piece of meat.  The waffle fries were out of this world.  The Texas toast was SOOO good!  When I got back to the office I was super excited to learn two things.  This is an independently owned business - this is their first location.  And even more cool - they have gotten a perfect score by the Health Department more than six times in a row.  Wow.   So you can eat some really great food and support a new local business for a $5-7 lunch.  Not bad.  Not bad at all.
other Places like Made make me realize that there is hope for my life in Phoenix.  It is a cute converted house shop that carries a wide array of stuff that you won't find easily elsewhere.  There is lots of cute baby stuff that I would laugh at if I ever saw a baby wearing.  The jewelery is unique and cool- it made me feel like I had etsy right in front of me, live!  They have some good books around and some key David and Goliath pieces.  I heart places like Made, so therefore I heart Made.
other Dropped by for a manicure, and as soon as I sat down, my manicurist started talking in rapid Vietnamese. I couldn't see her headset so I thought she was speaking to me, but obviously she wasn't. In fact, she never looked at me during the lightning fast manicure, except in confusion when I said I didn't want her to cut my cuticles -- just push them back. She really didn't understand that, and asked me in broken English why I was getting a manicure but not getting my cuticles cut. She didn't have an attitude about it, but was just really confused. I think after that exchange, she told whoever was on her phone about it.I also thought it was strange that she asked me to wash my hands after giving me a lotioned hand massage -- sort of defeats the purpose of applying lotion to my hands in the first place? The whole experience was perfunctory, but didn't leave me wanting to return for a manicure. Not asking for a great nail technician, but it would have been nice if she acknowledged my existence other than doing my nails, and most importantly if she asked whether I wanted them cut round or square because I wanted them round!  I would have interrupted her phone conversation to let her know my preference, but she was so fast to dunk my hands back into the soaking dish that I didn't see what they looked like!
other I've been coming here for years...the best.  One of my favs is the lulu wings.
other FANTASTIC little lunch/brunch spot! Went here with the family while visiting Scottsdale and really enjoyed it! We had the Tuna Melt, which was delicious with their spiked cottage cheese! The cranberry chicken salad made into a sandwich was DELICIOUS! The omelets and scrambles looks great - I didn't taste, but then again, there was nothing left on the plate! LOL Smaller place so could be busy during peak hours, may call or try and hit an off time. Service was ok, wasn't anything special but the food was really cute and made for a really cute little lunch spot!
other Good service and good food! I ordered the burger sliders for lunch without the 1000 island dressing and loved them! A quick little meal for those on the go! The attendant even offered me a nice tall glass of ice water to go while I was waiting.
other I was in Mesa for a workshop over the weekend, and this was a convenient place to eat. I wasn't overly impressed. The food was ok, and there was nothing wrong with it, but I expected more from Mexican food in AZ.
other I was accused of training my wife for compensation and was told to leave the gym or he (Page the trainer) was going to call the cops.  I don't know how a trainer confuses me working WITH my wife with training my wife for compensation.    Management handled this issue horribly.   Their lack of attention to the matter showed exactly what a customer of 6 years was worth.   You are treated only as a number.  Do yourself a favor and stay away.  I have since started going to a gym which is much more expensive but worth every penny to be treated with respect.
other What's not to love? Herb n Flavors uses local, high quality ingredients, the food tastes GREAT and they are vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free friendly! I especially liked their vegan spinach and artichoke dip! We will definitely be back soon : )
other Authentic mouth watering food.Got the steak fajitas dinner....extremely satisfied.
other I have lived steps away from this place for years and a few months ago, my boyfriend suggested I give it a try. Since I'm very picky with mexican food places, I had doubts, but boy was I wrong! All I can say is wow!!! This place is amazingly delicious. I thought I would never find a place who served authentic Mexican tacos and out of the blue I found it in a hole in the wall strip mall and just steps from my house! This can be a good thing, but also a dangerous thing because I am trying to lose weight. This place is so good. I got two tacos and I know I will be going back again and again.
other I love vegetarian restaurants! I support them 200%. So glad this place exists in Phoenix. The quality of the food is beyond excellent. The meals are creative and super tasty. Never disappointed. The only qualm I have is the service. It...is...slow. Whether it's the time it takes for my meal to reach my table or the cashier taking my order to ring it up correctly. The length of time it takes should not be so long. Prices are a bit steep but most vegetarian/vegan restaurants are priced a bit higher than others. I don't mind paying more for quality. Overall this place is a favorite weekend visit. I can't wait for my next meal at Pomegranate Cafe.
other Lash Extensions by Cher here are AMAZING _Affordable. _She listens to your every wish for the final product. _Very friendly. _Accommodating evening appointments. _Reasonable amount of time to complete. _She is pretty busy so make appt in advance. I wouldn't go anywhere but here for lash extensions! Cher is the greatest =) aaand no I am absolutely NOT Cher haha just one of her very satisfied customers.
other I love this location, and I love this product.  I think the prices are reasonable considering the quality of product you are getting.  If you've only been to the Scottsdale Fashion Square location and hate it, give this one a try.  It's got a much better vibe and is a lot less packed.  Walked right in was helped, she grabbed what I needed and I was off.  It took all of 1other minutes even with picking out a totally new foundation then I used before.
other Excellent.
3 Hmm, a bit disappointed. I had been here several times when I used to live in Scottsdale, but that was 3+ years ago, and I must say that I think things have gone downhill here. The bruschetta toppings on the combination platter were odd for the most part, with the exception of the traditional fresh tomatoes and basil, which was delicious and worth mentioning. The provolone on the sausage bruschetta was excessive and the overall combination of flavors just didn't work. The pesto bruschetta was SUPER garlic-heavy, even for someone like me who loves garlic. I couldn't finish either of the latter types of bruschetta. Onto the main course - pizza. Had the Toscana, which has mozzarella, tomato sauce, mushrooms, and sausage. The crust was burnt and flavorless and the toppings just seemed kind of bland and strangely old-tasting. I mean, not fresh. Weird, I know. I sort of liked the red sangria, but it was a somewhat odd twist on sangria, as it was pretty sweet and not very strong. I am sorry, Grazie. I am spoiled by having had the best pizza on earth in Chicago and am too excited to try the other acclaimed pizza joints in Phoenix/Scottsdale to return to your restaurant.
other To say this place is super rad would be an understatement!!  We for las noches de las luminarias.  And I wish we could've stayed longer, also seeing the gardens during the daylight is added to the 'to do' list!  Having never been there the staff was super helpful in guiding us, not to mention really friendly!  The music was entertaining and a good variety.  They also have a synthetic ice rink and you're allowed up to 1other minutes of skating, if you're not shy!  The buffet they offered was a joke and I don't recommend doing it.  For 16.50, you're only allowed one trip through and other such silly stipulations... no thanks.   Other than that, what a great place to go!
other Finally a place where my kids and I both love the food that doesn't serve chicken nuggets and fries! My kids love Blue Burrito's kids chicken quesadilla, especially the churro that is included. I love their salads and taco plates. The free chips and salsa bar is a big hit with the family. The place is always super clean and the staff is very friendly.  The perfect place for lunch on their new patio now that the weather is cooler.
3 I have visited Tokyo Stop twice now for an a-ok lunch. There's nothing really bad about Tokyo Stop, but it just hasn't blown my socks off. On my first visit I had the bulgogi plate. It was HUGE. Full of hot marinated beef and a large serving of white rice. I've had bulgogi several times before and this bulgogi is a-ok. Again, not the best I have had, but not bad! I poured Sriracha all over it and I was a happy girl! The second time I visited, I ordered the teriyaki chicken combo. Again, another a-ok dish. Nothing fancy! The prices for each dishs is VERY reasonable. I don't think I've paid over $7 for anything.I would most certainly visit Tokyo Stop again. They offer a solid lunch at reasonable prices.
other My mother and I were actually getting out of the car to go to Streets of New York next door when she smelled the Mexican food and suggested we try Roberto's instead.  That should tell you what you need to know right there.It's a hole in the wall place for sure, and leaves much to be desired visually, but the staff was exceptionally pleasant and the tables were clean.  If you're looking for fine dining, this isn't your place.  At $7-$10 for an entree, though, it was delicious.Beans, rice, and chips were pretty standard, but the salsa, fish taco, and shredded beef tostada were very flavorful.  The food tastes homemade, and in this case, that's a good thing.This place was also featured on TLC's Diners and Drive-ins show back in the day.  One of Anthem's best kept secrets.  I'll be back!
other Outback is a great restaurant. You can count on the tasty food and good service. They are reasonably priced and consistently deliver a quality product. This location gets busy during dinner time, but I've always had a good experience.
other I hate to admit it (because I usually avoid ultra trendy places like an ex boyfriend) but I love Postino.  It used to be an old post office, thus the name.  It is now a wine bar that serves "light fare."  There are not too many places with this kind of atmosphere in the Valley -- very California.  One of the walls is a giant garage door that they roll up so the whole place is open.  Little couches and coffee tables are mixed in with tables and high tops for a variety of seating choices.  The bathrooms are lovely, clean, and lit by candles.  The salads are my favorite in Phoenix and the bruschetta is out of this world.   Come early, get your table and enjoy!
other These girls know how to make working out awesome and fun!!!! Quality instructors, will not disappoint!!! Lots of variety!!!
3 I love the layout of this outdoor bar. However, the price of drinks here and the lack of well options is a huge turn off. It's also going to be interesting to see if people are into the idea of an outdoor "dance club" once summer comes back around. The view is awesome. I'm always up for supporting independent downtown businesses, this place just needs to make some changes to make me want to come back.
other Seriously.  I seldom give other stars, but it deserves at least this much.If it wasn't for the location and the super scary after dinner club scene, I would go every.single.day.Truly one the best BBQ places in greater Phoenix.  My mouth is watering as I'm thinking about the Hog Heaven special.  In fact, my puppies mouths are watering too.  Decent prices, giant selection.  One of those places where the early cowboys of the SW would appreciate.   If you are a cracker family, I suggest going super early, like super early bird special early , like when the snow birds come out for the senior special early, because after dusk, the whole place transforms into a pulsating super loud, super dicey Mexican Dance Club, and the blue hairs are sure to have a coronary attack after indulging in such a  lipid laden meal as they attempt to make their way out of the Club.   Ah the sacrifice for decent BBQ....
other No, I don't want to take the bus to get to the train. In my opinion, they didn't go far enough for people who live in Phoenix. It may be a good solution for Tempe and Mesa residents commuting to Phoenix, but it isn't effective for Phoenicians who want to get from the north valley into CenPho.
other Imagine this, a swanky new Scottsdale restaurant that has down to earth prices, fantastic food and attentive top-notch service? Sometimes it's hard to believe that this kind of place even exists, but its no mirage, the Spotted Donkey Cantina is everything that I had hoped and more. Starting with the service, there are details that just go to show how the owners and management are in tune with training of the staff. Everyone we encountered was pleasant, seemingly happy and genuine. I have to tell you though, when it comes to eating at SDC, you'll be in good hands, Chef Patrick Bolls hands to be exact. His background includes years working with local chef-lebrity Robert McGrath, which has paid off in chiles. The southwestern influenced menu is well balanced with just a little bit of something for everyone. I mean who doesn't love the addictive crunch of La Canasta Corn Chips ($6)? Along side are 3 different salsas including a smoky charred tomato, a deeply flavored red chile orange and finally a tomatillo green chile salsa. All were surprisingly mild though these seemed more about flavor rather than scorching your face, that'll come later.The "Shooters" ($8) seemed harmless enough. A chubby jalapeno pepper stuffed with cheddar cheese and bacon then encrusted with a coating of tortillas and deep fried. At fist bite your mouth is filled with a creamy spurt of hot cheese followed by the pork-tastic flavor of bacon. Then it hits you, the burn from the jalapeno is scorching but a quick dip into cilantro buttermilk sauce helped cool the flame. If you're still trying to cool the flavor induced fire one of SDC many salad choices will do the trick. The Spotted Donkey "Chop" Salad ($12) is prepared table side with you controlling the amounts of roasted corn, cucumber, queso fresco, cilantro, warm smoked bacon, and avocado. Then tossed in a luscious jalapeno buttermilk dressing and served with crispy flour tortilla chips on the side, it cools and satisfies. Composed into tidy rows of tortilla crusted chicken breast, avocado, bacon, chopped egg and manchego cheese and dressed in chipotle vinaigrette, the dinner sized Southwest Chicken Cobb Salad ($12.50) was almost big enough to share. The center of my universe, at least for a minute, was the char grilled Big Ol' Jack Ass Angus Burger ($11.50). This is a seriously tasty burger, topped with cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, avocado, jalapenos and horseradish mustard, fries on the side. Continuing with the meat parade, a sizzling iron skillet filled with Fajitas ($16) was placed in front of me. While you have your choice of chicken or shrimp, the idea of beef tenderloin mixed with sausage, sweet onions and tomatoes seemed like the hearty choice. Along side are the usual accompaniments like guacamole, salsa, crema and warm flour tortillas, what was unusual were how quickly I scarfed these down, delicious. While the space feels decidedly modern and upscale there wasn't one moment where I felt uncomfortable or out of place, even with burger juices running down my face.
3 I've been to Silver Spoon once, I need to go back to really make the decision if I like it or not.  I went in the summer, it was kinda hot in there-- like most places in the summer but, the heat makes me grumpy.  SO I need to go back when the weather is normal.I got a salad-- it was massive, a little too much dressing for my liking.  Okay, A LOT of too much dressing but I ate it anyway. I'll probably try something else next time.  The staff was nice, the snarky guy that someone mentioned was snarky, buy snarky in a fun loving way, at least that is how I took it.  Snarky can come off all wrong and bad if not done correctly or if you just aren't in the mood for it, or if you yourself is snarky too-- then it's a disaster.  It's close by my work so the fact that I have not returned makes me keep it at a 3 star review.
3 This Dunkin Donuts is hit or miss.When i run in here for just coffee, the service is usually very fast and prompt. When i run in there to order coffee and food, that usually becomes a circus. There have been times when i've waited over 20 minutes for my food. Usually it's not a problem, but when you have a business meeting that you have to attend to, it is. Fast food, pffft. Bring a sleeping bag.
other Yes, the view is wonderful. Absolutely. Sadly, my table was near the entrance, limiting my ability to enjoy said view. Also, we are still in the summer months, so I was confused that there was a fire raging outside at night. The decor is wonderful, dark with different tones and moods. We arrived in the early evening, so I was surprised to see how dark the room would eventually become. I didn't find the table and its decor that exciting, but it will give it a pass. Not everything has to be practical art.Our party consisted of five and we were certainly treated to a good sampling of what this place had to offer. Half of the party ordered off of the set price menu. This included a three course meal for something like fifty dollars. It may have even been less than that, but I'm not sure. This menu had an array of choices and wasn't limited to chicken or pork. I was impressed with the portions and the quality. The salads were crisp and the dressing wasn't overpowering, more of an accent, the way it should be. The meat was tender and flavorful; our table ordered the NY, Ribeye and Salmon. I do agree with others who said that the sides were a little small, but I do think they were worth the price. I know for sure the cream of corn was, as it was treated with green chili and a bit of spice. The desert was alright. Not a great deal of variety. The textures were spot on, but the temperatures seems a bit off. If a dish was intended to be served warm, it was slightly too cold, etc.The service was bad. Probably the worst service I've had at any restaurant. Our server left items off of the tab, forcing her to return and run the debit card three separate times. I am okay with someone making a mistake, but it should not take two attempts to correct. Also, my wife and I ordered Mojitos. They were very average. No sugar, which I assumed was standard fare for Mojiots, and amount of mint was rather low. I understand that drinks are open to a bartender's whim, so I won't dwell on this fact.Valet had a bit of trouble with our car and keys, which was annoying.Overall, I enjoyed my experience, food and atmosphere alike. However, the service did bring me down a bit.
other We popped in here for a brew while walking around heritage square.The waitstaff is very friendly and attentive.Note: if you just want a brew - you can order it inside!We went with a local Hefe and it was great!The options for noshing look great, but we were headed for dinner so we didn't get a chance to try them out!See you there soon!
3 I'm no regular here, but on occasion I get a craving for an Iced Mocha that tastes like chocolate milk. Tully's has that down. That's the only thing I've ever ordered here (I go elsewhere for my usual espresso needs), so I can't speak on the rest of their drinks. But, I don't imagine the rest of their drinks being bad; their Iced Mochas are very enjoyable.The service can be spotty. There are a couple ladies that work there that are sweet and take good care of the customers. But I've also encountered a couple of employees that aren't friendly and/or are super slow. Whatever; Tully's isn't my usual haunt. But it's good for what it is: fast-food-coffee.
other We came there on November 5, 201other and the service was very bad. The worst I have ever seen and we were treated like shit. We came into town from LA and Vegas for the NFL game and seen Mrs. White's cafe on Foodnet Work and knew the food had to be great. The chicken was great, but the customer service was so bad we will never return again.  We got a refill on our drinks and the guy poured sum of our drinks on the left overs so we could not take our food back to the hotel. Foodnet Work shame on you for recommending this place. Just because the chicken is good, does not mean you treat people like shit. We had to remind the staff over six times to get our order. We waited over 40 minutes to get the other 3 pieces of chicken to finish our meal. We don't mind waiting but it was pretty rude when you are watching other peolple are getting their meals when they walked in after us. The Mac and Cheese did not look like everyone else's order- it look like it came out of a box. You can tell it was far from homemade, it cleary was not bake, no crust. The gravy was watered, missing favor. Corn bread was over cooked under salted. The cornbread sure as  hell did not look like everyones else's cornbread. I felt like we received the leftovers. Truly the worst service we ever received. The place needs to learn how to be respectful and just be nice.
other my husband and I started going to Keegan's on Sunday's for their brunch, which is pretty decent. If you get there after 10am, the bar is open, which is a plus in my book. We've eaten lunch and dinner there a few times as well. They have a really good french onion soup, another soup I think was chicken pepper jack and the cobb sandwich is good. Their chicken fried steak is pretty good as well. They give you two decent sized steaks covered in mashed potatoes and gravy.The bar is good as they have a great selection of beers. I also love their ice tea, it always hits the spot.
other After sitting at our table for 30 minutes and not getting any service, we left.  But not before the hostess said thanks for coming in. Needles to say I will not be returning.
other Love the idea - vegan Mexican. Have tried to eat there twice. Both times checked their FB page for hours, both times they were closed. Called their phone number, no one answered. No sign, no explanation on FB. Pathetic.
other Is it worth the trip for a Chirico and Egg sandwich from Chaka Chaka, heck yes!!!!
other Treated my sister-in-law to a message here on Super Bowl Sunday.  They have great hours & were very accommodating even though we only made our appts about 2other hours in advance.  When we booked, the receptionist (who was really helpful and nice) mentioned the groupon promotion ($40 for $100 worth of services) as well as SpaFinder gift cards.  We thought we could combine them, and we arrived at our appt to find that they weren't supposed to combine discounts.  But the receptionist made an exception and we were really appreciative!The massage was nice, could have used a little more pressure.  Cute atmosphere and friendly/helpful staff.  I would come back, especially with SpaFinder/discounts.
other Two trends that need to end.  ASAP.  Really, ahorita:1.  Bacon mixed with everything under the sun.  Bacon doesn't need an accompaniment, it's amazing all on its own.  No more bacon donuts.  Please, for the love.2.  Overuse of truffle oil.  Dumping truffle oil on a dish does not make it gourmet.  Please stop.  For real.Culinary Dropout is guilty of succumbing to these two trends.  That being said, the service and atmosphere make it forgivable.  Our server and the manager were hyper aware of how long we'd been waiting.  Even though it was not that big of a deal to us, it was nice to know they cared.They mean well when it comes to cocktails, but they were a little lightweight for me, relying heavily on simple syrup and mixers to dumb down the alcohol.  Their beer list made up for it, though.  I've never had a stout in a can, but they managed to find the brewery that pulled it off.Yeah, my ricotta gnocchi was drenched in truffle oil, but the sausage and mushrooms made it actually a pretty good dish.  And the beets were fresh and delicious.I liked it, I'm not gonna lie, but I wish they'd stop falling prey to the trends and branch out a bit.  Culinary Dropout, you're better than that.
other Just tried this place this afternoon. Very friendly staff & great rates with no commitments. You don't need to worry about paying some $25-$40 co pay like at a regular Chiropractic's office each time you visit. It's $49 a month and you get four visits a month. It's not like massage envy where you have to sign a contract for a year and its hard to quit. This goes month to month. Try it out once for $19 if you want. This company is really growing. So stop by and see for yourself!!
other Horrible service.
other short, fairly easy hike but not well labelled/marked!  i went with a friend who had been before so that's how i knew which way to go.  even then, we both got lost trying to find the parking lot!  easy parking in the zoo parking lot - you can see the "hole in the rock" from there so just park on that end of the lot.  just a short walk down a paved road then some light terrain up the hill.  not a hard hike - i did it in flat sandals.  great photo ops at the top!  we went on a weekday so there were very few people around but my friend says it gets crowded on weekdays.  also, no water fountains and bathrooms in sight so take care of all that before you go!
other The Duce is a disaster. As an Arizona native and a downtown local I root for cool interesting places downtown. I wanted to love this place. The 1st time we tried the Duce I was extremely let down by the customer service. The parking is atrocious. It's as if you are inconveniencing the staff by asking where you order food. They were out of just about everything we wanted to order. So disappointing. However I decided to give them a second shot. Everyone has a rough night. We went to an event there last night the entertainment by Scandalesque was AMAZING... same TERRIBLE customer service from the staff at the Duce. Management needs to wake up. Great concept. Horrific customer service and staff.
other This is an outer arts district staple in the Valley. The neighborhood is spooky if you don't know the area, but it is worth the possibility of having your car vandalized to stop in. Great live performances, mellow guitar, etc. and fantastic food. Hummus plate, Mm. Greek salad, yum. Cheesecake, yes please. The service is European style so expect to wait and wait some more. Seat yourself inside or out on the lovely patio.Across from a fun locally-owned boutique you can stop by if you're there earlier in the day. I stocked up on the 70% off gift certificates for this little gem of a place at: http://www.citydeals.com/deals-merchant-Paisley-Violin-Cafe-Phoenix-AZ-LOC41462852.html?id=2852You can thank me later. I'll probably be at the table next to you.
other Have you ever tried the chicken rotisserie here? They go fast so you have to be lucky to get one unless you call ahead. Its not so much about the rotisserie chicken as it is about the amazing and creamy and smooth and exceptionally well balanced Garlic Sauce/spread they give you that goes along with the chicken. Have I told you how amazing this spread is. If only I knew the recipe...I would eat it by the tub...okay maybe by the spoonfuls. Anyway...try the chicken rotisserie or the chicken taook. Heck if you don't want to eat either of those things...just ask for some garlic sauce on the side with whatever you are eating. You will not be disappointed.
other I finally made it out to the Rokerij's infamous happy hour and it didn't disappoint. My girlfriend and I had a couple of the small plates, the mushroom toast and stuffed mushrooms (both amazing! but I REALLY loved the mushroom toast) and some wine. The inside is really unique to Arizona and completely relaxing. Our server Eric was super nice and chatted with us a lot about the restaurant and the menu. We will definitely be back for half priced bottles of wine and happy hour very soon!
other I'm rating this place as a Music Venue and Bar, not as a restaurant. UB's seems to be hosting a slew of Metal shows over the next 3 months, which is good to see a place open it's arms and bar to the metal community. As far a heavy metal venue goes, its run of the mill. It has enough room to either mosh or sit in the booths along the back wall. As far as the bar, the prices seemed slightly on the high side, especially for the "dive-ness" this place exhibits. Their beer menu had other or other typos on it, just something to chuckle at, such as Rolling Rook beer, O'Dools, and listed Fat Tire as an import. (Cuz Colorado is SO FAR way). Luckily, beer and metal go together, so people tend to pay. The old man in the Bolo tie checking ID's was definitely a good sport.
other This speakeasy was kickass. The staff is super down to earth and the menu is great. The drive thru is an awesome touch. I got the Turkey Club and it was reallllllly good. We received other randomly free samples of a shake and smoothie and had some good conversation with the guys behind the counter. It gets a little noisy if they're makin shakes in there, and the seating is pretty limited. I wish they were open later but so far I'm loving it!
other The Paseo Trail travels through Chandler along the Consolidated Canal.  It runs mostly N-S, connecting to other trails along the canal in Mesa and Gilbert, totaling around 18 miles.The trail is mostly paved on the east side of the canal and pea gravel hard pack on the west side.  It runs along subdivisions, golf courses and even a couple farms.  The grade is very gentle throughout.  I would consider the trail primarily for use by joggers, bicyclists and equestrians.There is parking at the address listed for the trail and nearby parking at Tumbleweed Recreation Center at McQueen and Germann.  There is also easy to find street parking near many of the junctions with major streets.  A good southern starting point is off of Riggs Rd. between Arizona and McQueen.  There is plenty of street parking.  From here the ride north is mostly a slight uphill ride, making the return trip a nice relaxing roll.One issue with the trail is crossings with major streets.  Most are not marked for motorists as trail crossings and there is no crosswalk so you may be faced with a relatively long wait to get a break in traffic or forcing the issue and forging ahead with care.
other 4.other Stars... I really enjoyed Beckett's table! It's a large, cool looking room with exposed ceiling and brick walls. They have a small patio and I heard they're planning to build a large patio on the side of the building. I met a couple friends there and we shared a few different items: The drink list has some great looking combos and a nice variety of wines. I tried the Palmaire, a lemonade/pomegranite combo. Very refreshing! We had the grilled cheese with pancetta to start... I love a good grilled cheese and these were perfect little bites. It came with roasted red pepper tomato soup. The soup tasted like pureed roasted red peppers; I would have preferred a little more balance with tomato taste. The roasted brussel sprouts were sumptuous; intense flavor and a little crisp on the outside. The fire roasted green chile pork stew was very tasty. The corn bread that came with had a perfect sweet contrast. I tried a bite of my friend's short rib - very tender and lean. We ended with the creme brulee, which came with fresh blackberries. At first I passed on having bites (I'm not a huge fan of creme brulee), but they pressured me into trying it... YUM! I may be a convert now. Overall, a great pick! Shout out to Katie B. for the suggestion.
other I really love Pita Jungle.  My first experience was at the one downtown, and now, I have to get my fix.  I found this location since it is close to my home, and wanted to check it out.Upon entering, I was pleased with the location.  Well decorated, clean, good lighting, ample seating.  I was greated by the hostess, and sat at the bar.  The place was pretty busy, and I was by myself.  I was greeted in a quick manner by a nice server from behind the bar.  I took a moment to review my menu, and decided to skip a full meal and go for some lentil soup.Now, here is where things get dicey.  I won't hold it against Pita Jungle, but I have to put this in the review.  First, after being seated, I noticed that it was a little toasty in there.  I think they could have turned up the A/C.  I am sure if I had been drinking, I probably would have broken a slight sweat, as it was warm in here.  Secondly, after I ordered my lentil soup, it took what seemed like forever to get it.  I did not time it with a stop watch, but it took a long time for just a bowl of soup.  Secondly, when I did get the lentil soup, I didn't care for it.  It looked kinda gross and didn't taste all that great.  And, in case you were wondering, NO, I didn't send it back or complain.  I was to tired and didn't feel like being a sourpuss.The other problem that I experienced, was the server girl brought out my check WAY before I was ever served my food.  I hate that!  At least bring my bill with my food, not before!Aside from that, I dig this place.
other Maybe closer to 3.other but I am rounding up because I'm not opposed to being won over by "smart" bartenders -- when I ordered drinks she asked to see my ID and then followed it with, "you look so young, you must get that often." Granted, she looked younger than me, but I am not opposed to having my reviews swayed by cute bartenders who know the right buttons to push. In addition, the house margarita was good, and I have been known to throw bad margaritas all over the bar in a fit of rage when I don't get carded...fortunately my vanity was satisfied. The space is very nice and open, and despite the decent size crowd, it didn't feel crowded. Our wait was less than 20 minutes and there is ample place to sit and have a drink while you wait. Now, I must say, I don't know that the required staff uniform is unattractive, but it does seem like an impromptu tennis match could break out any moment. The braised short rib enchiladas were good and the fish tacos were even better. The tacos were slightly overstuffed and rather difficult to eat as a result, but the taste was good (3 shells, as opposed to 2, with the same amount of taco insides would be better). While the waitress didn't attempt to win me over with flattery, the service was prompt and attentive.
other I've been giving a lot of 5-star reviews lately, but (in my opinion) they all deserve it.  Movies on Central RULES.  They have 99.9% of every movie title we've looked for.  Since summer started, we've been in there at least once a week.  Bonus:  they have a water cooler right by the door.  Sweet!
other Dear Weather & Coffee,I'm really sorry you had to close.  We had a lot of good times together.  Every time I came in, you always seemed really happy to see me... even though you knew me by the wrong name.  I may be Kelly to everyone else, but I'll always be Aubrey to you.
other I went there on a Mon around 9:30 am. It was a ghost town and we got seated very quick.I have to say they have the most comfortable seats!  I didnt sit in the chair but a like bench couch thing? Super soft.The whole decor and music vibe was really cool, I really dugg it.My girlfriend got  french toast (because she is a bitch and has to be super toned and fit with out working out or eating good)which came with chicken apple sausage. Ok, heres the thing about that, I hate sausage(insert lesbian joke here) but it didnt have the typical sausagy flavors. It was really  really good. It was tangy salty and sweet. The french toast was extremely good. I think it may have been dipped in blueberry before cooked?The waitress was super accomodating, and nice. Oh and they do have french press coffee which I was disappointed by , but after I had it.. holly crap best coffee ever!!!! it was smooth had good flavors, no bitterness at all. The only use butter and vegetable oil which is soo nice to see they dont load you up with horrible for you margerine. My only complaint is, I ordered a sandwich and got a totally different one. When I told them she went to the cooks and found out they didnt have that bread and randomly added egg? She took it back and it was no big deal but she informed me it was only a month old and were still learning the menu. Kinda weird but nothing big, my new favorite breakfast place.
3 Despite the nice layout, design, and store variety of the City Center, I was still heartily disappointed. Some friends and I were merely trying to find a parking spot to do some shopping and things of the sort when we were notified that it was going to cost us a hefty $30 to park in a MALL parking lot. Outrageous. Turns out the WWE was in town and I guess they wanted to get some extra cash out of the mullet sporting, dentally challenged fans of Wrestlemania. Cool I guess, but not for us that were just trying to buy some swag. They offered some sort of validation system to reclaim some of the $30 coughed up, but it all seemed more than shifty in nature so we decided to park elsewhere. Everything else about this nice outdoor shopping center is exceptional. So waddya say Westgate? Create a better system for those of us not there for the events at the stadium across the way?
other I recently saw a Coyotes game here and I was seriously impressed. This arena is super nice, almost mall-like and clean on the inside. What also impressed me was how much stuff there is around the arena. Where I'm from, you'd have to drive somewhere else if you want to go to dinner before or hang out after the game. Here you can just stay in your cozy little free parking spot and hang around. Probably my only gripe is that the screens on the inside could be a little bigger, but other than that. this arena is right up there.
other There are few places that are delicious hole in the wall chains.  In fact there really are no hole in the wall chains except Two Hippies and they do it right.  Upon entering two hippies you will see all kinds of crazy decor like a twister mat on the ceiling, chairs... on the ceiling, etc.  Your food options consist of Burgers, Hot Dogs and Tacos, where as your beverage choices consist of regular stuff like various sodas to flavored tea and lemonade.  The flavored tea and lemonade is AMAZING, the flavor in the flavored teas is so good you don't even need to add sweetener, that's impressive.  The food is equally as delicious, I had other tacos one was fish (not fried, baked tilapia -so good and healthier) and green beef, they have a red beef and green both are cooked with different peppers and marinades,  The green beef was amazing I'm def. looking forward to trying the red beef as well as the "cactus" taco which is just insane sounding.  Two thumbs up, bring cash though because that's all they take :)
other Best bruschetta I have had here. Good wine selection as well.My favorite bruschetta are:-smoked prosciutto, fig, mascarpone, truffle oil-roasted chicken, sundried tomatoes, goat cheese-pulled pork, housemade pesto, roasted red pepper-mozz, basil, roma tomato, qc olive oil & balsamic
other Eh?  How have I not written a review for Matt's?  I went there a while back, but thankfully it won't be hard for me to recall the experience!Place - Small.Food - Fantastic.Wait - Usually.Bathroom - An adventure.We didn't have too long of a wait when we went, but that was entirely luck. I've seen crazy waits here, which is just par for the course when the food is good. Most of it is local and very, very good. Service was fast, and spot on.The bathrooms are next door in an old motel. Apparently a separate room set aside just for Matt's. Just one more stand out feature for a very stand-out sort of place!
other Went here for the first time a few weeks ago. The owner was snoring when I walked in, so that was odd and kind of a turn off. Their regular manicures are cheap- $10, but the experience overall was so-so. It got busier as my manicure was going on, so it got a little better. Parking is pretty bad..they have approx. 3 spaces. Manicure was fine..have a range of OPI but all their polishes were jumbled together which I hate. Overall, for a few dollars more there are better places, even down the street.
other drove past and saw the sign, and after having spent several years in Texas, had to try this place -- and was extremely impressed. I had the moist brisket, and even without sauce, it was awesome. Nice pink smoke ring, moist and tasty. They even had the sides of dill pickles, jalapenos, and onions -- yum!I also had the cole slaw, and it was very good as well.I definitely want to go back and try the hot links and the turkey -- but both my friend and I really enjoyed our first (of many to come) visits.
other This park is fun for anyone. They have attractions for anything you are in the mood for. They have a full water-park, arcade,  go-karts, bumper boats, mini golf, etc. It is a fun place to hang out with your friends. Depending on what you are planning to do, the prices vary. Go-Karts are $5, Golfing is $7.70 (don't play the last hole, keep your ball, and go to the next course), arcade is addicting!
other Lots of awesome packed in a cute little restaurant. Visited here on numerous occasions and never had to wait for a table. Service is excellent; friendly, and witty waitresses are a breath of fresh air. As is the patio, which is a perfect venue to enjoy a meal next to the fountains. The view of the gardens at lunch time is also a nice tidbit. Loved the chips too. Chimichanga is A-okay!
other We came here Sunday morning for a wonderful breakfast. Our server was Colleen. She was very attentive and we had  a great meal. The menu is so extensive with many ,many options. I got Florentine Eggs Benedict and my boyfriend had a fabulous omelet with potatoes and toast. They were both delish!     Their Potatoes are fab!!   The Decor was very nice, and even though they were so busy,we did not wait long at all for our table.  Big parking lot and a nice waiting area as well. We will defiantly come back here soon.
other The time was 4:30am.  It was dark and a little chilly with the sun not yet up.  Perhaps that's why they call it Black Friday, but my money was on the delicate hint of malice in the air as I stood shoulder to shoulder with  veteran soccer moms with steel and fire glinting from their eyes, Scowling teenagers and college students bubbling with nervous energy and the occasional hen-pecked dad who got talked into dealing with shopping insanity as some sort of a special treat before trudging off to the salt  mines for the day.There were at least five hundred infantry ahead of me and five hundred behind me and our numbers kept growing.  There were scattered bits of conversation but most of us were silent, contemplating the chaos we were about to charge into for the sake of our families, our friends, our lovers.  But mostly for the sake of savings.  We glanced ahead and behind, sizing up the competition, mentally calculating our strategies for navigating the battlefield.  We were at least a battalion strong.  Perhaps a regiment by the time the doors would open.  And it would be every man woman and child for themselves.Occasionally, someone would open a wallet or a purse, checking and rechecking their ammunition, occasionally running a finger along the edge of a bank card or bill to make sure they maintained their razor edge.  Slowly, we began to march forward and the slow but steady trudge was a stark contrast to the sense of frantic urgency that crackled in the morning air.  Not all of us could walk away victors, but all of us were determined to try.Then something happened.  Something I would have never expected.  As we approached the double glass doors, we were greeted by another army.  With their bright blue uniforms, they could have been UN peacekeepers.  They handed us each a large plastic bag and ushered us into the store with bleary eyed smiles.  The fear and tension started to lift.  I have been at Toys R Us on Christmas eve.  I have seen the very worst of Holiday spirits and I was ready to face them again all for the sake of an (CENSORED) that (CENSORED) just had to have.Yes the store was crowded.  But there were so many helpful, indeed cheerful sales attendants on hand that most of us shoppers just melted into a gentle wave of requests which were quickly and cheerfully met before anyone could get bent out of shape or stressed out.  A sales clerk simply asked me to wait for a moment while she located a reserve ticket for the doorbuster item I had stood in line for.  One minute and fifteen seconds later she returned with a document which guaranteed me my desired item at the desired price to be delivered to me as I left the store.  Another clerk helped me locate the other items I needed and I was done with my shopping within ten minutes.  Of course it took another hour or so to work through the serpentine line at the checkout but all of us were so relieved at how painless and indeed bloodless the shopping experience had been. We were more than happy to stand in line waiting for the opportunity to plunk down our hard earned cash on the latest objects of technolust that had caught the eyes of our loved ones.  We left tired.  And we left poor.  But I dare say most of us left happy and for that Best Buy and the entire Best Buy army have my eternal gratitude.  Thanks for taking the ass out of Christm.
other Haji-Baba is unique by being both a restaurant and a store! As such, the restaurant is fairly small- so if you're up for some delicious middle-eastern food on a Friday afternoon, make sure you arrive early!The prices are good, the selection is better and the food is great! I ordered the falafel plate which came with other falafels, a side of hummus, and I subbed the tabooli out for a salad. The portion size was pretty big, so I left quite full, and it was all delicous! I'll definitely be going back soon!
other This place bothers me.  I already everything about country so going to these kind of places freaks me out.  I was forced to go here because the boyfriends parents were in town and they choose Cadillac Ranch due to their type of "cuisine". I have to say the foo d wasn't bad.  Server messed up my order but when they got it right it was ok.  I will not go here again however.  Sorry.
other Great drinks!!!Good atmosphereFantastic food (the bbq chicken pizza is a must)Nice people to conversate withWhat is not to like?Oh yes, the creepy guy that kept staring at me. Oh well, he will not be there next time I go...I hope :)
3 I love supporting such local businesses in my neighborhood- and you should too!  If I worked in the area, it would be in my lunch rotation.The customer service here rocks- it appears as if they actually care if you enjoy the food you have ordered.  I appreciate this and think they deserve a huge kudos on that one.  The hours are pretty ridiculous- they close at other on weekdays and are open from 10:30-3:30 on Saturday's.I've had the Route 66 (Buffalo chicken) and the Ringo Starr and have enjoyed them, but it wasn't true love.  Don't get me wrong, fair choices but no real excitement.  The Sirachi chili sauce helps out- but I love that stuff.A solid choice, although not mind blowing in any stretch of imagination.
other So great to see the occasional NY style pizzeria pop up amid all these chi-town "pizza" impersonators... Sorry, but if you think pizza is cut in squares, or it's crust should taste like a stale saltine cracker, perhaps this isn't for you.A great street style joint with friendly staff and always a great selection ready to go, and conveniently located right next to AMC 24. Bring a messenger bag or purse and get some Vincents to go, and avoid the concession stand. Just sayin...
other The Original Burrito Co. is quickly becoming my favorite burrito place. The owner came to eat at the restaurant I work at and she told me to come by and try this place out and being a huge fan of Mexican food I had to go. The burritos are really huge and really well priced. I love the California burrito with Chicken, add guacamole. The chicken is so moist and tender. I have tried the carne asada as well, but when I got it it was full of cilantro and jalapenos, which were just overbearing, but I'm thinking it could have been a bad day and will have to try it again. Downside for me would be that the salsa is not spicy at all. It tastes very good, but I am a huge fan of spicy, especially on Mexican food, and its a bummer for me when a place does not offer a very spicy salsa.
other Great selection, and great prices! Get a customer card and rack up points... at the end of the year, they send you a coupon to use on your next visit.  I spent $50 last year and got a $other off coupon.Staff is knowledgeable and are always available if you need help. They have a self-production line of products that are great and cost much less.Go check it out!
other great, family owned place that feels like the kind of italian joint that is made with love. Food options are very good with traditional italian dishes and unique entrees that can't be found elsewhere.
other What happened to this place?  The first time I went about a year ago, both the food and service were great.Second time, last May, I ordered the same dish and it was horrible.  Drowning in sauce.  But, at least the service was decent.Just went a third time and it will be my last.  Both the food and service were horrible.  Went for lunch, sat inside and it wasn't very busy.  Our waiter was totally out of it and only had other tables and hardly paid any attention to us and kept forgetting things, like taking our order to start.  Then, even the food runner forgot to bring me half my meal after I asked her for it.  In the meantime, I counted at least 17 staff member hanging out in the kitchen area, which is open, so you can see them and half of them were folding napkins.My food was not very good and actually made me a little sick.  This is a shame, especially because there aren't many places in Phx that have vegan choices, but for the price you pay, I would expect a lot more.
other Never been in - but I get pizza delivered from them now and then. I am a New Yorker and to call me a pizza snob probably doesn't go far enough.The crust is crispy, thin, and foldable, the outside edges, crispy and bubbly. Great mozzarella. I have never been disappointed by a topping. A little greasy, as it should be; it reminds me of NY pizza, and that's a big compliment coming from me.We don't have a Ray's in Central Phoenix... but we do have Mamma Mia's. Yo! Tony! You make a good pizza.
other Wow these cupcakes were amazing!! The frosting was picture-perfect. I tried Vanilla Salted Caramel and Pumpkin and both were so good! The cake on both were super dense and moist. Vanilla Salted Caramel definitely was the best of the two!
other Today was our first time eating here, so armed with great reviews from other Yelpers, we sampled a bevy of appetizers from the happy hour menu (daily from 4:30-7p) and shared a pasta entree. Of the apps, we had toasted ravioli, a platter of antipasti, and by recommendation from our lovely server, Amber, the stuffed eggplant.  The toasted ravioli was delicious-crispy and battered with a crust of parmigiana, melty cheese on the inside. A dip in the flavorful and slightly spicy marinara sauce finished it off.  The antipasti platter serves about other light eaters, but for me and my spouse, it was a nice compliment to the two other shared appetizers. The stuffed eggplant was covered inside and out with gooey, cheesy goodness and marinara sauce.  This was to be the main portion of my meal while my husband had gorged on the appetizers, but after a taste, he started sneaking bites while I wasn't looking!  I added some chili flakes for a little heat, but It was very flavorful.  I'm not a huge melted cheese lover and would've preferred a little less cheese, but it was perfect for my husband.The restaurant wasn't super busy when we arrived at 6pm, but by the time we left around 8pm, the main dining room and the adjoining small rooms were about 85% filled.  The prices were higher than what we normally spend, but we had been given gift cards by my brother and happened to come during happy hour, so it wasn't that bad at all. Our bill came out to about $17 without tip and we didn't order drinks.  You do have to sit in the bar area to receive the happy hour specials, but we didn't mind.  We'll be back!
3 I loved the old menu, but the changes gave me a change of heart. They had the best sandwiches & it was always quiet from other until 8 so you could sit & eat. The new menu is okay & we liked what we got, but we would've left if it wasn't happy hour. Even though the servings are big(maybe too big) the prices are retarded now. The buffalo chicken tenders were pretty good, but perhaps too spicy in the wrong way. I used to go & send people all the time, but without those yummy sandwiches & with the higher prices, we prolly won't make it back again. The servers usually are slow & fairly unattentive, but the menu was bringing us back.   :(    sad to see it change that way.
other I've been taking mine and my family's cars to Cathedral for more than a decade. We are always treated fairly, and always have a good experience - the guys always stand by their work and "go the extra mile" to be sure our cars are fixed properly. They work on both our new(er) cars and my cars from the 50s and 60s. Whenever anyone is looking for a mechanic, I will send them here without fail - and John and the guys at Cathedral have always come through by totally taking care of anyone I send to them. In a business filled with some sketchy practices, I know that whether I send my wife, a friend, or a coworker to Cathedral they will be treated honestly and fairly. Cars break and break down, that's a fact of owning one. I'm glad I have Cathedral to make dealing with it so easy and stress free so I can get back on the road as quickly and cheaply as possible.
3 I'm sad to say that I wasn't in love with MacAlpine's.  The fact that the building has never been restored is cool, in a dirty kind of way.  The floors will never be clean enough, because they are so old.  That may seem ridiculous, but cleanliness is important to me when I'm eating somewhere.Our server was odd, but helpful and attentive.  We spent a good amount of time oogling the random items displayed throughout and were entertained with our surroundings.The food is where I saw the problem- my Mac Cheeseburger was bland and tasteless.  My broccoli and cheese soup was below average.  I wasn't impressed one bit.We ended up having dessert.  I opted for a single scoop of Chocolate Malt Krunch, which I'd never had before and didn't love (total personal preference as my friend loved it).  MacAlpine's is cool, but I think purely as a place to get something sweet.
other I try and eat here regularly. Hummus is great. Very personable staff. And the atmosphere is awesome. Look forward to the next time!
other This place is exactly what a local coffee shop in Phoenix should be.  Lots of sunlight, good iced coffee.  (Also, apparently, they serve wine!)
other This is the closest to a New York hipster style coffee shop I've seen in Arizona.  They serve beer too.  Problem is that the espresso was unbelievably bitter.  Cookie happy hour is pretty cool though.
other Very good battered dipped fish, cole slaw bland, fries came barely warm. Service is fast for crowd, very nice and friendly staff. I'll go back for the fried cod. Did have to exchange coffee cup. It had some funk dried and stuck to the inside wall.
other The customer sevice and ambiance here are always great. The managers have always taken care of any issue we've ever had.The prime rib is really, really good! So is the Steak Au Poivre!That said, I have to admit that the rest of the food can be pretty hit and miss. I've never had  awful food here, but several disappointments. The managers and staff are so polite and work so hard to make things right that we keep coming back.The pricing is a bit high for the inconsistent quality, but well worth the early bird and happy hour pricing.
other Ok it's a chain, so there's that...  But I'm like Bro'man and we luv us a good sammich!   And Capriotti's didn't disappoint there.I went at an odd time and had the place to myself, it was quite clean and instead of just hanging out BS'ing the people were busy taking care of the place.So the menu - short and sweet, that's how I like it.  Unlike a place like the friggin Cheezecake Crapory with it's 80,000 menu items, none of them done well, Capriotti's keeps it under control and turns out a tasty sammy.  I had the turkey sub with spicy peppers, mmm mmmm.  I love the fresh roasted turkey like that, and the "just like grandma made" pickles.  Well not like either of my grandma's made, but someone's grandma...  The veggies passed the fresh & crispy test with flying colors and the sub roll was perfectly soft and chewy.Ya it's slightly on the higher end fast sandwich price range, but its quality and pretty filling.  I made other meals out of the 9", with the meal deal right around $10.  I have a Groupon for the place and can't wait to take my good friend and get him hooked.  Next victim on my list:  the Bobbie!!
other I have mixed feeling about the W Scottsdale. During the day the pool area is poorly run, but in the evenings the pool turns into a pretty fun nightlife spot.  Daytime:The pool is always jam packed with a fairly disgusting crowd and the dudes out number the babes by a 3 to other count I'd say. That's no fun. Oh, and by dudes, I mean douche bags. And Babes? More like gross skanks covered in makeup at the pool. Ok, I guess I'm being a hater, but spend a few hours here and you might be kind of disgusted with the scene too. It's just really amateur hour here with the piss poor service and their bad attitudes and obnoxious patrons. The only reason I came was because a friend likes to stay at the W when visiting and he too noted the quality of this place has declined over the years. He has stayed at four different W locations (NY, South Beach, Westwood) and said this one is the "worst and trashiest". It took an hour before any waitress came over to ask if we wanted any drinks or food. When started to get service it was always a long wait for our pitcher of margaritas or buckets of beer and food. Speaking of the food, the fries, fish tacos and club sandwich are all great. The grilled cheese, not so much. The first $4other pitcher of margaritas was weak, hardly tasting any alcohol. The second pitcher was stronger. To be fair, the Saturday service was much better.Nighttime:Much improved scene, but still not great. There are a lot of out-of-towners since it is a hotel, but still plenty of locals too. I think it's a good mixture. Pants and collared shirts are required, so that usually gets rid of most of the tank top, neck tat wannabes from earlier in the day at the pool.  But really, you are just trading one group of wannabes for another. Man, I'm a hater huh? Oh well, you can handle it. Drinks are overpriced, but this is the W. Be ready to spend lots o' cash.Rooms:I've been in a few rooms at this hotel. Each have been nice and clean, but pretty small.
other Beautiful parish, also home to the amazing Legacy Ballroom that is available for wedding receptions and events.  The annual Middle East food festival is a wonderful family event with fantastic food, pastry, and entertainment!
other Great selection of gelato! Friendly welcoming staff. Reasonably priced, deliciously rich gelato!
other Pretty good place.  Separate bar area upstairs with lots of TV's for sports.  Nice size portions.  A little pricey, but big portions.
3 Sooo...if they ask you if you want to sit in the 'lounge'...just say no! Trust me... Artichoke brushetta is good but garlicky which I like
other OK after hearing about this restaurant from a friend I decided to take the family out. First I must say that living in the valley for over 30 years I still and always will be a Haji Baba fan in Tempe Az. for life!(yelp them)So, walk in and would agree that the ambiance was less than. Dinner tables were cheap and the table cloth was tacky. Oh almost forgot why is there a large mirror on the wall? Were given dinner menus by a impolite waitress who I suspected was surely going to be the owner. The first thing that hit was the prices! $$$ I kindly asked the waitress if I could just have a Gyro sandwich. The answer was NO! (rudely). Those are only available during lunch time! Ok, so next option was to gamble on a gyro plate priced at $14.95. We placed our order and waited. The food arrived on a timely manner. The food was hot and looked good. The tzatziki-sauce was a 10! Although the gyro meat was not to my tasting, it was ok for being real hungry. Eventually the waitress started warming up to us! :) PROBABLY WONT RETURN AGAIN.Pros- Fresh food, LocationCons-Couldn't get what I really wanted.(A gyro sandwich)-$$$ pricey! $36 for other adults and other children. (other gryo plates and a coke.)-No kids menu. -Water tasted like it was from the tap.-Coke was flat.
other My sister and I went here the other week and got gel manicures! They turned out beautiful and lasted forever! Ithink Biagio is now my go to nail salon! Keep it up!
other I enrolled my other year old son and other year old daughter into Hubbard. They've completed other swim lessons each and the results are dramatic. They have made huge strives in their water skills. Plus, it seems to enable them with confidence and self esteem after each lesson.
3 Hmmm ... where to start.  Food was good, flavorful, no complaints; although for the price I did not think the portions were that great - but everything was tasty and everyone enjoyed their meals.It's a big open place, with concrete floors and picnic table type environment.  Patio with misters and big open doors to the outside.  A good atmosphere for BBQ.  Someone mentioned the parking being marginal (very true - same as when this was a bar in it's prior life).  I think my biggest downside is how much I had to serve myself - go to the counter to order, pay, get to table, get drinks, get place settings (plastic utensils), for a beer have to go to the separate bar area, order, pay, return for more, etc. (can't order beer where you order food).While I enjoyed the food, not sure how often I'll be back - would not want to be there when it was crowded and have to wait in lines repeatedly.
other I always buy my tires at Walmart, but they didn't have a tire to fit my car. They directed me to Discount Tire and told me that they actually have better pricing. I went to this location and had the best experience. They were very helpful, saved me money, and I was in and out in under 2other mins. I will be back again and again!!!!
other When I bought my house a year ago, it came with a big, half-dead front lawn.  I decided to do a desert landscape out there instead, & called a number of landscape contractors I found here on Yelp & also at the Home & Garden Show at the fairgrounds.I soon learned that this is an unprofessional industry overall.  I had several company representatives never return my call to set up an appointment to come over & do a survey.  I had others schedule an appointment & not show up.  I had others come & do the initial survey but never get back in touch with me with a price.  One guy I called said he would look at my yard on Google Earth & email me a survey.  (He never did, & I guess a $3500 job didn't make it worth his while to come over for a few minutes!)  I had a couple of others who got back in touch but with only a materials list.  I had asked for a sketch of what they would DO with my yard for all this money!  After probably more than a dozen tries, I finally had 3 legitimate, complete surveys in hand to decide between, & the price range only varied about $500.One of my surveys was from Tom Baird at Creative Environments.  After the survey, he emailed me a materials list & a CAD drawing that gave me a good idea what my new yard would look like.  I liked it, so I went with them.  Next, though, my job got handed off to another company rep, David Inness.  David was likable, but the job ended up changing considerably from the agreement I had with Mr. Baird.  For instance, I was promised that a BobCat skip loader would be used to dredge down 4" to remove the old grass before the new materials were applied.  That & other promises were not fulfilled.On installation day, three workers (& no "Foreman Chico" whom I was promised would be here) came out to do the work.  They didn't remove the grass at all, but rather put down some black plastic material over about HALF (!) of the yard.  I complained, & one of the workers called Chico on his cell phone & handed it to me.  Chico explained to me that they weren't going to dig down, or put down any more plastic, unless I wanted to go to the hardware store & buy some more myself!  I tried to call David Inness, but he was unreachable.The materials included a big pile of dirt & a big pile of gravel to be used for the job.  The workers hand shoveled the dirt to form the contoured mounds as planned, but then only applied a very thin coating of the gravel on top, leaving most of the big pile on the driveway, AND LEFT!  That was it, they told me, & that I could use the rest of the tons of gravel that I had bought in planters around the place, or if I wanted, they would have it picked up in a couple days!After trying to call for a day or two, I finally reached David Inness, who got the workers to come back over & finish applying the gravel, which they did, but unevenly.  The gravel depth ended up being zero to 3" deep.  I moved it around some myself to even it up, but I shouldn't have had to, & since I didn't get the dig-down preparation, the gravel was already skating out onto the surrounding driveway & sidewalk.  David had the workers now dig down a little around the edges, so that the top of the gravel would be down about an inch to stay put better.This was the worst contractor experience I have ever had in my life.  The only thing saving it from a 1-Star rating is that the nice plan for the layout of the dirt & plants was followed, & the yard does look good now.  Of course I have a problem with grass coming up through the gravel, since it wasn't scooped out as promised.  (I attempted to kill it ahead of time with weed & grass killer as directed, but all my estimators told me you really need to do both.)If I had it to do over, I would have gone with Michael at Breese Landscaping instead.
other Sunset rise on new year's eve. Gorgeous scenery. Great short ride, but you cover a lot of ground with a lot of different amazing views. Saguaros everywhere. Great view of the lake from the top of the hill. Friendly staff. Drawbacks: horses seemed pretty tired by the end of the day (we were the last tour). Even though my horse misbehaved, our tour guide handled him very well. Looking forward to more rides when we return for vacation!
3 Cherubini is a clean, comfortable coffee shop.  The employees are friendly, but  no more than every other coffee shop I've been to.I had a decaf drip coffee, which was just o.k.  Nothing to complain about but not particularly noteworthy.I sampled other donuts...raised with maple, cherry iced cake, blueberry cake, and sugar raised.  The donuts were about average or a little higher.  Better than Dunkin but nowhere close to BoSa.  The cherry iced cake was the best, but all the donuts seemed a little too sweet.  I'm a donut fanatic, so I don't mind sweet...but these, just a little too much.Kudos for keeping up a good appearance and free Wi-Fi, but I won't go out of my way to visit Cherubini again.
other Ok....my 2nd review of an "Irish" pub.  And we're getting closer.  Good ambiance - I really thought it looked much like a few pubs I visited in Dublin (tho no pictures, that I saw, of the famous revolutionaries, no flags, no old photographs.  But a good draft beer selection.  And a really good Irish menu - we had the fish sandwich and the banger sandwich (lunch menu) which included chips (french fries) and I ordered a side of curry dip for the chips.  Good stuff.Good Irish music (cd's) playing in the background - not obtrusive.  And a very good wait staff.  The bartender greeted us the minute we walked in. But sorry, folks, music is Thurs thru Sat and no Irish music that they admitted to - cover bands instead.  So I'll keep looking, but I'll stop here when I'm in the neighborhood.
other Relatively inexpensive, good solid mexican food place. I wouldn't drive other miles for it, but its a lifesaver if you live nearby. Better than the 'bertos.
other Finally, well-qualified, well-established mechanics that don't talk to me like I'm a dumb, car-ignorant girl - even if I am. I was sitting at a desk establishing an estimate for my Honda within 20 minutes of calling them. The receptionist was polite and efficient, but truly the best part was their interactive, transparent estimate process. I was able to view the screen as my estimator drag and dropped the parts he suspected I would need into a spreadsheet. Then, I saw him calculate the labor hours - something I had NEVER been privy to before. Tracy's Auto Body was affordable, very quick and went above and beyond - alerting me to other pieces that were loose and fixing them for free. I highly recommended their services. They have a perfect record since the mid-1980s with BBB and with good reason.
other Have you ever had the Lean Cuisine chicken enchiladas? Have you ever been to a super obnoxious sorority party, where all the blonde bimbos are tanked and dancing on tables and such? Have you ever been totally ignored by wait and bar staff even though you've doused yourself in lighter fluid and set yourself on fire? Well. Then. You've been to San Felipe's. Lower than mediocore food. Except for the grilled fish tacos. Thus other stars. Not 1. When I lived at DCRanch, I thought this would be a less expensive, less formal place to hang out. Hmmm...other than grabbing a quick beer here I'd sooner stay at home, eat Doritos and watch a sorority slasher film. What do Kristin and Pierre say? Meh? Yea, that's it. Meh!
3 Been here other times.  Had I reviewed after my first visit, I would've given the place other stars.  The server was nice and attentive and the food and drinks were delicious.  Had I reviewed after my second visit, I would've given the place other stars.  The server was quiet and not as attentive and the food was cold and bland.  Since I'm just now getting around to reviewing, I guess I'll give it 3 stars.  Really a bummer when you enjoy a place once only to go back and have a no-so-great experience.
other I came here on a strong recommendation from a friend. After reading the reviews, I was anxious to try it out. I went on a Saturday night, half expecting it to be really busy. We were seated in about five minutes or less. Not busy on a Saturday night...made me kind of worried. The menu is sparse, it made ordering really easy.  Service was fairly slow considering the small amount of people in the restaurant. Refills were slow, service was kind of inattentive but not rude. Our pizza came out in about 15-20 mins. We ordered a white with garlic with pepperoni and sausage. The pizza looked and smelled delicious, but that's where it all went bad.First off, the pizza crust was really soggy because of all the grease under the pizza. I have never ate such a greasy pizza in my life. i had to drain every single slice, it literally created a puddle on my plate. There was a significant lack of sauce on my pizza, some parts of my crust were bare, not even a hint of red on them. The pepperoni and the sausage tasted great and there was enough toppings on the pizza to justify the $other price tag. The non soggy areas of crust were great, and the cheese was amazing. We ended up taking half the pizza home, the slices were filling. The pizza was better the next day, after the box absorbed most of the grease, after throwing away the pizza box, the bottom of the box was saturated in grease. I'm not sure if grease makes a quality pizza, but in this case it just made a soggy crust.**Update** Under intense pressure I came back here and tried a white with chicken, they seriously redeemed themselves. I spoke to the manager and he insisted my last time was a fluke and should have been corrected. I would come back on occasion.
other They have a limited time thing going on right now with BBQ chicken pizza (not sure how long it's going to last) but let me just say it was amazing.  Probably THE best BBQ Chicken pizza I have ever had.  I have tried other things too, like the tomato basil soup, and many of their sandwiches ... very good, very fresh - every time.  The other stars is for the pizza, but if I were to rate Jason's Deli over all they would get about a 4.
other This place has to get all five stars. Ok, the area is a little suspect I will admit; that can be countered with the excellent food and excellent prices. This is the kind of food that goes for $1other - $15/plate if it were located in an upscale area.  They have done a great job with the interior and the food is really wonderful.other Top reasons I love La Condesa: ~ Beautiful food. Unique flavors.  ~ Great salsa bar: aver a dozen lovely hand made salsas; I liked them all ~ Price: you can spend under $7 and have a really good meal ~ Convelient: It is only a other minute drive from 24th & Camelback. ~ Atmosphere: the interior and the service create a great place to dine.***We eat out several times a week, and this place is now at the top of the list for my wife and I both.***
other They have the friendliest staff at this Whole Foods. They know me by name and always have samples ready for the little boy I nanny before we even walk up to the Deli counter. Maureen the checker, Kathy in vitamins, and Daniel & Paula in the Deli are all exceptional- go see them if you need anything they will be happy to help.
other This place is classic goodness! Everything tastes rich and fresh! Has a new modern feel with a twist of luxury and artistic flare. The food presentation is gorgeous and the food tastes even better then it looks! In a wonderful area of town and is built in the old post office. An inventive and one of a kind idea has really set apart this delicious place from any other restaurant in the valley!
other I love books and I love bargains. Put the two together, and you have a place called Bookmans, or as I like to call it, my book heaven. I recently purchased four books for about $30 -- that's the price of one, new hardbound book -- and was thrilled by all the great bargains I found during my casual stroll through the many, many isles of books, cds and dvds.What I love about the whole used bookstore concept is being able to give a new life to a book someone didn't want anymore.  I especially get a kick out of finding old books with inscriptions inside. One I found says:       "Pam, This is my number other all time favorite book. I hope you have        a relaxing holiday with your family and look forward to adventures        in the new year!"I felt bad for the inscriber, since the book obviously did not become Pam's favorite, so I bought it in hopes that the inscription would ring true for me.I'm glad a bookstore like Bookmans is around and that they are able to compete with the big chains.  It is a great place to find great deals, and I'm hooked!
other I love to come here from time to time when I'm in the area and I am always highly satisfied with the food and service. The menu is great and there's a variety of dishes for every taste. The service is great, everyone is always really nice and the atmosphere is quiet and relaxed. Definitely a great place to have dinner/lunch with friends. I read some other reviews from people who complained about the food, mostly these were meat eaters, I'm assuming, so of course they were not satisfied. This is a %100 vegan restaurant, note it.
other Dr. Greg Allen is the best doctor in the East Valley and probably the state! He has the best of bed side manners and is caring in his listening to the patient's needs. We have used him for several years and trust him completely.
other The food was ok.  Waitress forgot my guacamole.  Wait staff continually bumped into our table.  Great wine list.  Nice decor.  I may or may not try again.  Not impressed by the food. Id go up to Narcisse or True Food instead.
other This is definitely not your typical run of the mill nightclub. First off, let me mention that the decor is gothic cathedral style complete with erotic art, bright lights, and a chandelier over the bar. There is a unisex bathroom that is very clean and surprisingly never awkward. The music on Saturday nights for Doom Disco is an amaazing mix of old and new (think Joy Division and She Wants Revenge). Plus, the bartenders can make a mean gin and tonic and they have a pretty well stocked bar for any other drinks you might fancy. Tip: Doom Disco also has a Facebook page where they post pictures and the playlist from the Saturday before. Check it out!Overall, it's 100% worth the drive and $other cover
other HORRIBLE service - did nothing to correct our experience.On July 7, 2011, my date  and I arrived around 6:30 pm, well dressed and ready to enjoy a celebratory dinner without any financial limitations. We would have easily spent $250+.Instead, after an hour of being seated  to review our menus we were never offered more than a cocktail.Tables around us were receiving quality attention by other servers...complete with the run down of the specials, house favorites, answering questions, etc. We, on the other hand, were lucky to have our make server look at us, much less take us to the next step our level in our dining experience.When the table behind us, seated a good 1other mins after us, received bread before we were, my date and I decided that was our tipping point and would not stay any longer.When our server came to ask if we were ready to order we informed him  we would not be staying for dinner  and would like the bill for the cocktail.Never once did the server apologize, offer what he could do to make things right, etc. Needless to say, we were stunned. The hostess thanked us for dining on our way out...again, we both gritted our teeth with frustration. However, later we discovered that after an hour of sitting in the dining room, we were there long enough to enjoy a meal. It's unfortunate we never got the opportunity to, however.What did go right was...we were promptly seated and the cocktail server provided decent service.
other Had the mahi and it was great.  Very reasonably priced also.  Definitely a repeat.
3 Decent food at not unreasonable prices. The service is good. What is up with the hyper aggressive pigeons on the patio? The waitresses actually pass out squirt guns to the the customers to fend off the ever persistent waves of the foul fowl. At the end of your patio experience there is a certain sense of camaraderie shared with the other patrons.
other I mostly buy mountian house and other camping foods from REI, they have a huge selection to choose from, including biscuits and gravy. don't expect other star restraunt food, but on those long days at a Military range Mountain house beats the pants off MRE's not to mention you could eat 3 mountain house meals and be about where a MRE is. I've been drooling over several other items at the store, I'd like to go backpacking sometime and they have tons of little things that could make things a little more tolerable for either Military operations, or camping/ backpacking.
other This studio is probably the best hot yoga studio I have been to. I went there several times a week for about a month over the summer and enjoyed it every time. I love the music they play and I love that the teachers are knowledgeable and motivational. I really got a great workout while going. The space is clean and even smells good....that's pretty awesome for a hot yoga studio. I like that they have wood floors...it makes me feel like they can keep it cleaner and it's easier to balance on. The reason why I knocked it to other stars is because it is simply unaffordable. I have a fairly good job, but I don't think I could afford to keep going. If this place was reasonably priced, it would definitely get other stars from me.
other This is one the best venues in Phoenix in my opinion for live music. Wonderfully low-lit, divey atmopshere, Great drink prices and down-to-earth crowd with no pretense or attitude. The bouncer/doorman was ALL pimped out and welcomed me with a handshake. This is really a great alternative from hitting a bar or a club. A true gem in The Valley. Only downside is parking. The neighbors don't like it if you park in front of their house-my friend was yelled at by one of them. And they "punished" me by positioning their trash cans in front of and in back of my car.  If said neighbor is reading this review, know this: Next time, I'm going to take out your stupid trash cans. I understand it sucks to have people park in front of your house, but I was not loud, nor did I puke or urinate or your lawn, so chill!
other Wedge salad is delish! Love the fact that it's organic, as well as the fact that the pizza dough is gluten-free...sure beats having my husband sneeze for an hour, after eating "regular" pizza. I will say, the pizza is pretty good...and this is coming from a girl from Chicago!
other Great place, great food, great environment .
other This is my favorite of the Yard House restaurants and not just because it is on my side of town.  The food always seems to be done just right and my husband and his sister enjoy the beer.  Would have given one more star but my husband has yet to find any food item that makes him want to go here over some other restaurant.  Since I just can't seem to get enough of the grilled cheese and tomato bisque soup it is very disappointing that he doesn't want to go.
other Are you kidding me, this place is great.  Perfectly sized bread, quality ingredients, cool staff.  When I think dream sub, I think italian night club no mayo, and extra peppers.  Don't get no betta!
other My girlfriend and I love Crust and frequent here often. They have amazing pizza, the Rustica is enough for two, and we usually split a salad. They have whole wheat crust, upon request, which is actually really good. There service is awesome and we always enjoy ourselves when we visit. They have a great wine selection by the glass and by the bottle. Our favorite is the red blend that is very unique, let it breathe though. They also have many flat screen tv's so you can keep up with what ever sporting event is on. The atmosphere is casual, but it can get noisy if the restaurant is full. The only time we've ever had poor food is when we do pick up. It's always been hit or miss then. We've never had a bad experience actually visiting the restaurant, which explains the other out of other stars.
other This is the best ice cream I've ever had, bar none!  I had the salted caramel, and it was wonderful!  I felt like I was 7 years old and enjoying my first ever ice cream cone.  I also love the decor of the shop, the braille on the back wall is so cool (although I do wonder exactly what it says!)  I also bought a pint of their ice cream at Whole Foods, I love Sweet Republic and everything it stands for!  Totally recommended!
other My husband was born and raised as a British Expat in Hong Kong and loves the Chinese Cultural Center for its authenticity. There are some great, inexpensive and authentic restaurants there serving a wide variety of Chinese foods. There is a place called the Seafood Buffet on the west end of the plaza and the food there is fantastic and lunch during the week is around $7. Golden Buddha (next to the amazing wedding shop) has an inexpensive lunch menu and I've heard the Dim Sum is incredible. The grocery store in that plaza has tons of authentic Asian foods that you won't be able to find anywhere else. Just the smell of the different foods and spices takes me back to my last trip to Hong Kong and really adds to the experience. I don't know what half the stuff there is, but if you wander through the candy aisle you should pick up a few random pieces and just try something different. The Center has a festival around the Chinese New Year  where they have street vendors selling all kinds of goodies including a huge selection of decorative Koi fish and various cultural performances. It's really a unique place, especially here in Phoenix, and is worth an afternoon visit if you're looking for something different.
3 The festival seemed a little smaller than what I expected, and I didn't find a lot to peruse when not looking at various food booths.  They had a lot of local Japanese restaurants selling food, such as Nagasaki Grill, Paradise bbq, and Arai Pastry, which was nice but I am close enough to all those restaurants that I could just buy their selections any time at their restaurants.  I think I've been too spoiled by the Japanese festivals in San Francisco, since the food selection here was more limited and there wasn't as many booths to buy things from.  I did like the cultural shows, such as the taiko and the martial arts demonstrations, and the shaded area with the bonsai and akitas was nice.  I think in general though, if you don't live close to Japanese restaurants or haven't had a lot of immersion into Japanese culture, this is a good way to introduce yourself to it here in Arizona.
other I think Mr Goodcents has the best subs in town.  I have no idea why people go to Subway.  Goodcents slices the meat and cheese when you order your sandwich and their bread is baked fresh - you can't beat it.  Get oil and vinegar on your sandwich and the taste is to die for.  The staff was very friendly and oftentimes the owners are there working.  $other footlongs are there too - only they taste 20x's better!  They're all over the city if this one isn't in your neck of the woods.
other Say hello to the Ghost Lounge, folks. This is a brand new bar located right next to Seamus, within the San Carlos through an agreement with the hotel's ownership. For years, I've thought the Hotel San Carlos was an under-appreciated (through its own fault) downtown venue. With the Ghost, the owner has finally executed a plan to revive its rightful place on the downtown Phoenix scene. This is apparent from the first step inside the lobby, which appears as it did in 1928 when the hotel first opened. If celebrities in the 1930s had to spend the night in Phoenix, back then a small, un-airconditioned cowboy town with around 50,000, they would have stayed here. (Or else the near-by Westward Ho). You get a taste of those times with the massive photographic blow-ups the Ghost has put up on its walls of various scenes from early 20th century downtown Phoenix. So large that you can zero in on individual pedestrians on the streets, and marvel at their bowties, cowboy hats, handkerchiefs and facial expressions. Back then, the San Carlos was probably one of the only places in town that was "air-cooled." (That may have meant it had swamp coolers. I haven't googled the history of air conditioning technology for this review.)I'd describe the bar's style as grandiose, and classic old school Phoenix with an obligatory hint of Chicago (obligatory given the decades-old economic relationship betweeen the two cities that endures to this day). It has been beautifully done. I will be back often.
3 Went here with an Indian friend so I can't tell you what I ate, BUT it was tasty. We went 5:15pm on a Thursday and it was pretty empty, but as the night progressed more and more people filled the place out.They do have a lunchtime buffet but not sure the price or quality of food, but if it's anything like the dinner we had...its worth checking out.
other When I was growing up we called this the canal. In other parts of town it is still called the canal. In some places people actually fish from it. I think they die right after they eat their catch, which is why you don't see them very often. Over the years you periodically hear about dead bodies being found in the canal as well.  Google it.What is so annoying about this is that Scottsdale, is trying to make it seem like this isn't the same heinous canal that's always been there. When I heard about the development around the Scottsdale Waterfront, I couldn't figure out what they were talking about. What water? Then I started cracking up when I found out it was the canal.Come on Scottsdale, you can put a dress and lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. You are not fooling anyone.
other Have been to the Garage twice now and they are batting other for 2.   Went there on a Saturday for lunch and the food and service was excellent.  I had the pulled pork sandwich with sweet potatoe fries which was original for pulled pork served on a pizza crust bun.  My girlfriend had the buffalo chicken salad which was really good, grilled chicken in buffalo sauce on top of baby greens.  Excellent beer selection.Went there on a Friday for happy hour and got there a little before 6, there was a 30 min wait for a indoor table or immediate seating on the patio, so we decided to sit on the patio.  Hostess sat us and said a server will be by shortly, normal procedure.  About 10 minutes later no server had come by and the hostess returned and asked us if we ave been helped yet, we said no so the hostess said she will get someone.  Another 10 minutes and no server.  It wasn't busy on the patio about other tables occupied, all with food and drink.  We decided that they must not want our business, so we went next door to Sushi Eye.Will try again, just won't sit on the patio.
other I gave an extra star just because it is so fun to hang out here.  The waitresses are always cute and friendly and not afraid to pour your drink.  Alot of my friends are in love with the food here, I have to disagree. I think good but not great.  Still this place gets the nod from me just because it is so fun to hang out.  Chances are you will meet some new friends there too.
other I have been craving some soul food for quite some time, so I kicked and screamed til someone finally took me to Lolo's. After memorizing the menu for weeks, I knew I wanted the Baby Ray. So we go in and I was overjoyed that they had a band playing some sweet grooves. I jammed out a lil while waiting for about 10 minutes. We were seated in a nice lil half booth/table combo and had a huge jar of koolaid and sweet tea delivered to us. Yum! I starting getting the biggest sugar rush halfway through the wait. When my food did arrive, I was presented with two waffles bigger than my face, 3 big pieces of chicken smothered in enough gravy and onions to fill a whole gravy boat. The chicken was spectacular, really good flavor and crisp(when not soaked in gravy, get it on the side?). Gravy was pretty good as well.  The waffles were alright, I can't say I am the biggest waffle fan, but the subtle cinnamon flavor was nice. I think the waffles could have been better in my opinion. I am kicking myself for not trying the grits and collared greens or the red velvet cake. I could not finish my second waffle though, so much food, couldn't even think. The service was probably a B-. The hostess was bubbly and sweet. Our server was busy and a little frazzled maybe. The server gave us the wrong change and seemed to not believe that she had. Waiting for the correction was longer than average for sure. Overall, though, I had a good time, perfect way to end my weekend.
other In the mood for a little snack? this is the place. Don't remember what I ordered (my indian friend helped me), but it was good! and also try desserts!!
other I never tire of a deliciously hot bowl of Pho from this place. This service is efficient and the food tastes so very fresh. The veggie pho is my favorite along with the soft appetizer spring rolls. My son usually gets the beef pho or one of the fried rice dishes and we have never been disappointed. Good lunch crowd every single day of the week. Yummy.
other Man the chompie sliders is the bomb.  Wish there were some in LA.  Man taste so good and flavor.
other Until they get their quality under control, we won't eat here except for lunch. We ate here last weekend and both had the roasted chicken. The problem was it tasted like it was basted in cinnamon and the sauce for the risotto had at least 10 whole peppercorns on each of our plates. I actually bit into to one before I realized that the sauce was just crawling with them. They could've strained them out, processed them in, whatever, just don't serve me a plate with a bunch of whole peppercorns. This tasted NOTHING like the previous visit when I ordered the same exact dish. When we finally let the management know that our food was unacceptable, he said the best he could do was a 20% discount. Well. we  weren't looking for a free or discounted meal, but rather some acknowledgement that they actually cared about the food. That never happened. Unless something changes, the burgers are decent and that is about it.
3 I've got to hand it to Smart & Final for providing some incredibly economic pricing options for both name brand products and supplies. It's worth a visit to save some big bucks by shopping here. This is one of my go-to stops for party supplies like plates, cups, napkins, water, etc. Think of Smart & Final like the Dollar Store meets Costco.
other Brought my car in to get the electric stuff checked. $2other to do an electronic systems check, then determined it was a bad alternator. I brought my car in at the end of the day, about 5pm or so, and they had it ready by 11am the next day. The owner/manager, Terry, seemed like a straight up guy. Pricing is fair, as far as I could tell. They seem to stay pretty busy with normal cars as well as business fleet vehicles. I've seen school buses there, Topkick-sized trucks, and as well as your standard fare trucks with lawnmowers on the back.
other The food was flavorful and plenty of it. Eating with only your fingers is quite fun - make your momma proud. My girlfriend won the best dish of the night - lentils and chicken and cabage/carrots. It all had kind of sweetish/bitterish/spicy flavor. I had the lamb and jalapeño dish, which was kind of greasy. You eat with your fingers and can scoop up the food with the bread they give you - a tartish type crepe, which goes well with the food. I'd be happy to go back and try something different.  If you are used to frozen pizzas and Burger King, you might want to stick with that as this experience might bit be as enjoyable as those who are more open to what they consume.
other Duane is amazing!  Reliable, Responsive, Reasonably Priced, i simply can't reccomend him enough!  I've used him four separate times now and have been more than happy with each visit.  I won't call anyone else!
other IF YOU HAVE KIDS YOU MUST READ!!!My husband and I have never been more insulted at a restaurant than tonight at the Hillstone Restaurant (Biltmore).This is the same restaurant group that includes Bandera and Houston's. We deliberately went out early-- at 5pm -- with another couple and our son. He started to fuss on and off during dinner. Mind you the restaurant was already noisy when the GM Miranda Geranios instructed us to leave; other patrons were complaining. That was news to us- and we've seen far worse outbursts in the past from children. Ironically, our son at that moment was playing happily with the other couple when she rudely asserted herself. We were in the middle of dinner and to add insult to injury, she didn't even offer to compensate us for a future visit without our little guy. Just go home without dinner and pay the bill. Of course, she herself has no children. To ask a repeat customer to leave is absolutely disgusting. We will never visit any of their establishments again and wanted to share our unfortunate experience with our friends who also know the challenges of having a family.
3 I only did layovers in this airport to and from Colorado from California, but I liked it. There were a ton of places to eat which was fantastic. Their flights left on time, which was kinda annoying when we got in 10 minutes late and ended up getting stuck there for almost 3 hours. Free internet access helped with that though. It's an airport I don't mind being stuck in for a bit.
other My daughter and I really enjoy eating here. We tend to order the same thing every time because it's so good. She gets the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo and I get the grilled salmon nicoise salad. They both rock. It's cafeteria style all the way up to the point you pay, then you are served the rest of the way by a waiter who brings you your food and takes care of you. The food is always very fresh and delicious. And by the time we're out of there, it costs no more than eating in the food court but the experience and quality of the food are miles beyond. Highly recommended.
other May have great food but I'll never know. Ordered delivery and the chef who doesn't speak English couldn't find my apartment complex even when I walked out to the street right next to the 10other far away. He said he was there but couldn't tell me where he was. Talked to him on the phone for ten minutes then hung up on me when I guess he got frustrated and wouldn't answer my calls back. Called to order food for my visiting family and was glad to find this place but that chef is awful. The owner apologized to me profusely and that was a nice gesture but waiting an hour for a guy who hangs up on you and can't find a place looking at the 10other exit is ridiculous. Don't use them for delivery ever, call the Breakfast Joynt. Their owner is awesome and delivers to you himself. Plus, he actually knows the area. Cannot express my frustration with this restaurant's service. Do not use EVER
other Never having dealt with a Discount Tire in Phoenix before (only in Texas, and their service has been great all the time), I came in not knowing what kind of service to expect. I was pleasantly surprised! The store had a good amount of parking, and the store front was clean, open and had adequate seating around the perimeters. There were already 5-6 people sitting and waiting for their cars to be finished, and other people waiting infront of me to see a representative. All the guys working there were busy helping someone, yet were saying hello to us and reassuring they'd get to us very soon. I didn't wait an unneccesary amount of time and then was helped by Wally. He inspected my tires, recommended a plan of action gave me options, and we headed back into the store. After I made my decision to replace other of the tires, he checked their stock, and unfortunately they didn't have them there. BUT he called another store and had them picked up for the next morning, so I could just come back the next day to this same store and get those bad boys installed. Great! The prices were not as heafty (relief), and although there were a good amount of people the next day waiting for their cars to also be serviced, it took exactly the amount of time they'd told me (4other min). They apologized for the wait, but no need for that! The guy who helped me on the 2nd day (I'm sorry I forgot his name) was also very professional and great. I recommend this store and will be bringing my car here in the future most definitely. Thanks, guys!TIP: If you know you need to bring your car in, you can make an appointment with them online. They take walk-ins, but I believe it helps them manage their customers easier, and that in turn benefits you.
other This place is amazing. Absolutely LEGIT. Some of the best shawarma and hummus in the US (Zankou Chicken in LA is a close competitor). The pita sandwiches are stuffed with delicious fresh meat, traditional pickles, and tahini or garlic dressing (depending on preference). Ask for their hot sauce to help spice things up even more. And the Jasmine infused lemonade is crazy sweet, but really good. I love this place, and have been a die-hard fan for over other years now.
other These are absolutely my favorite donuts in the whole wide world!!! No offense to those Krispy Kreme lovers out there but I think Lamar's has them beat! Their donuts are always so fresh and delicious! My absolute favorite is the chocolate iced cake donut with m&m's. Just thinking about them is making me salivate! ;-)!! I suggest getting there earlier rather than later because sometimes they sell out of certain varieties.
other great service, great food, and great outdoor seating made for a wonderful first time experience at this charming little restaurant.you would think that sitting outside eating in the middle of august summertime in phoenix would be practically unbearable. local breeze made it tolerable and i don't think my overly-sweaty ass ever felt uncomfortable once during the whole dining experience. they had fans, a swamp cooler, and misters going and it made for a comfortable and charming outdoor dining venture.we started off with the greek lavosh which was to die for. the cheese they melted on top of it will make any cheese lover weak in the knees. their mojiot lemonade was crisp and refreshing. ok selection of beers, certainly not the greatest but i picked out a favorite, kiltlifter, to go with my coca-cola ham sandwich. my girlfirned (Rachel O.) went with the atomic burger as we are both fans of spicy food and this burger comes topped with horseradish. it even made her face scrunch up and me quiver in my seat the moment it hit my tongue and you better believe i enjoyed every second of it. the coca cola ham was HUGE and both of us only managed to eat half of it. leftovers are always good.service was spot on, and i enjoyed the decor and atmosphere despite what many people have complained about before. get over it, it's no longer pallete, move on, and enjoy the local breeze.
3 It's Pei Wei. The service and food are always satisfactory.
other We saw a small door with a sign over it and were intrigued, so we went inside - that's how we found Kazimierz.  Once our eyes adjusted (it's dark inside, like any good speakeasy), I loved the decor.  It's a wine bar with food that seems to be Egyptian flatbreads and then whatever the chef wants to make.  We were there on a Saturday, right in the middle of happy hour, and enjoyed a ridiculous evening of items that were mostly $8.  Wine flights, flatbreads, certain bottles of wine = $8.  BOTTLES OF WINE.  I'm sure they were just cleaning out old inventory, since they have hundreds of listings, but for these two wines, until they ran out of bottles, the bottles were $8.  We had the Northern Territory flatbread (pancetta, yukon gold potatoes, rosemary, crème fraîche and smoked gouda). Yum. We also had an open faced sandwich made with smoked pork belly, apple butter and melted cheese with sweet potato chips on the side.  IT WAS $7.  Between the $8 bottle of wine and that, I felt like I was stealing from these people. The bartenders were great, as so was the music.  I will, without question, be going back.
other This is an open-air mall.  Unlike most malls which are totally enclosed, this mall is outdoors.  In the outdoor area they sometimes have "events".  The Batman "Tumbler" was there for a day once, we've heard concerts here, and this last visit they had a sculling team there with their boat.They have many of the usual shops (American Eagle, Gap, Aeropostale, Victoria's Secret, etc).   The Harkins Theater hear is pretty nice.  We like the Genghis Grill for food (see my review of them).  The Paradise Bakery is nice also.  There are several other eateries here, but we haven't tried most of them yet.  However, several choices are available.This is a nice mall to just wander and shop, and eat and drink, and enjoy whatever is going on.
other We have been here several times and each time has been excellent. Our first time was in Hawaii and we were happy to see one in phoenix.         Me and my Fiancee had a four course Valentine's day dinner here. Dinner was great.  Food was timed right and our server was on top of it.   Our server sent us a personal handwritten post card thanking us.  Dinner came to be a little over $200 with drinks, so yes its pricey, but my fiancee and I loved it so it was worth it.
other This is another work lunch takeout place for me and it always does me right. I always get the Jerk Chicken bowl with rumbi rice and have never been disappointed by it. Good flavor, lots of chicken and veggies and rumbi rice is simply delicious. I personally like to add hot sauce and also sometimes splurge on a cup of tortilla soup -which is pretty freakin great. There's alot of cheese on top of the soup so lactose intolerants beware!
other Carly's Bistro is one of my new favorites - especially now that I'm moving downtown! Very vegetarian friendly, and lots of yummy dishes with tons of flavor! Their hummus is TO DIE FOR! So much flavor!!! My favorite sandwich is the Europa with roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts, tomatoes and spinach and smoked mozarella on cibatta. Delish!! They also have a fantastic beer menu! Quite extensive with a type to make anyone happy! They're a great location for parties, and offered happy hour prices on all drinks during the event.I'm going there for dinner tonight and can't wait!!
other I'll give this one a four for atmosphere and BEER... and Steve the manager. He rocks. The food- eh. I don't go for the food.So last 4th of July, we were having a keger. Hubski went to pick up the keg from Four Peaks (ice cold Kiltlifter) and there were some waitresses talking about the 4th and how they have no idea what it's about. Well hubski shows up and tells them all what's what. Now we've got a friend in Steve forever.Everytime we are there, he takes a break to chill with us. We got a tour of the facility. This is cool- the Kiltlifter is supposed to be a Scottish beer. Four Peaks actually has biologists balance the water to match the chemicals to Scottish water. The same with the Hefe- the water matches German water. This is all so that we can have the most delicious and authentic beer possible.Four Peaks is a laid back place, great beer, good people-watching. Bar food.
other other more star awarded: Upper Crust, you've grown on me. Reading through my previous review, I still have all the same criticisms about the ambiance, but three return trips and I keep finding more and more reasons to like you. * Excellent and attentive service, busy or slow* Michael David Petite Petit by the glass* Wine Wednesday: 1/other off bottles* Great deals through social media* To-die-for yummy crust
other being new to the area, i'm really on a quest to nail down my basic food groups: thai, persian, and mexican. mexican i've got down i think, but the other two i've kind of been baffled by. luckily i have my very own personal tour guide who invited me to lunch at yupha's one day. the place is pretty cute but can get pretty crowded when in the full swing of lunch. the tables are kind of close together, so be sure you arent carrying a big purse or anything otherwise you'll be whacking people in the head with it.i had the pad thai for lunch. HUGE lunch portions. i could barely finish a third of it and i had a ton to take home for dinner. also if you arent into spicy, i'd definitely go mild. medium spicy is pretty groovin, but i dont think it would work out well for someone who only wants a little spice. yupha's also has an interesting salad bar/soup thing that comes with some of the lunches. check out the salad with the peanut dressing. mmmmmm peanut dressing. i loves it. service is fast and friendly. take your check up to the front if you want to get out of here quickly. i think yupha's is going to be my work lunch thai place :). garlic beef here i come!
other I've done the Shabu Fondue more times than I can count!  Usually, I order a cheese fondu for myself, and my main man gets a Shabu dish.  They both apply the same concepts... dip something fresh into something very hot and cook it yourself with long sticks.  Mm!  I've tried all the cheese fondues, and the Swiss is my favorite.  That smell is unforgettable.  I've tried all the Shabu sauces too, and they're all pretty strong, so they season those boring vegetables right up.  The cocktail menu should not be over-looked.  The caramel apple martini is the best!!!  Now the chocolate fondue....  Oh it's so good!  They serve it with marshmallows, fruit and even a slice of cheesecake to dip in!  For a very small price, you can also add a shot of liquor.  (I personally always add a shot of Bailey's to add some flavor.)  This is a PERFECT date restaurant, and it's not bad for groups either.  The dcor is pretty rad too.  The portions are healthy, but it only works if you end the dinner with the chocolate...
other This just in: Houstons is on steroids! Yup, it's true. If you're familiar with Houston's you're familiar with Hillstone. But, Hillstone is better in my opinion. Why? -Wonderful outside "first come first served" patio seating with fireplaces -Indoor/Outdoor space for the bar area -A sushi bar (and shockingly really good sushi. We had the mango salmon roll - delicious). -No need to worry about Valet... lots of parking. -Great service.What hasn't changed is the menu and the crowd. Still your 40+ real estate suits - or should I say jeans + a blazer - and all the cougary women that come along with these men... Not knocking it, simply the truth.Overall, a great place for a good American meal, people watching or to take your parents. This isn't a place you'll be racing to take your friends who just came into town... it's a chain restaurant. There are way too many locally owned gems in the Valley to spend too much time here.
other This place had me from the moment our waitress asked us if it was o.k. if our water was infused with the flavor of cucumber.  Heck yeah it was o.k. in fact I don't even want to order a drink, I just want the free cucumber water!  My buddy and I decided to start with an app. order of sweet potato waffle fries with dipping sauce.  Delightful!  I ordered the sweet potato and garbonzo burger and the sweet potato and avocado salad side dish.  Notice the sweet potato theme??  I love those crazy orange taters!  The food was really tasty and quite flavorful.  The burger was a little different than I expected because it didn't come on a bun..but no biggie.  In typical girl fashion, my buddy and I split a cupcake...finger lickin' good!  I am picky-picky but this place won me over big time!  Also, I felt that, for the location, their prices were very reasonable.  The prices for those condos located upstairs..well that's gotta be a different story!
other I agree with others that it seems a bit expensive at $15- but that still would not steer me away from going.For the first time in about 8 years I found myself at the DBG with some out of town family. Wanting to enjoy the weather (since they had just escaped the cold grey winter of Detroit) the gardens were the perfect spot. The garden is equipped with wide paths and plenty of benches to help the old timers pace themselves. It helps remind us city dwellers of the beauty the desert can have and how unique Phoenix truly is.
other This is a great Thai food restaurant. My husband and I have been here a few times and have been very pleased with the food, as well as the service. We usually order a few curries and of course the pad Thai. The food is always consistently good. Good Thai food is sometimes hard to find, you definitely won't be disappointed here.
other Wow!  This place completely rocks!  Very professional, courteous, and very good at what they do - make cars clean again.  The price was very reasonable and I will be back again many times over!  Thank you, Stewart Detailing!  Job well done.
other Yen has amazing sushi. I would say that they have the best sushi in AZ. You have to try it to see how amazing it is. The service is great and I feel like I just stepped into Japan. The whole sushi experience is very authentic and perfect place to hang out with friends or take a date :DThere is only one thing I don't like. Sometimes it get's to busy so make sure to get there early (around 7 P.M) if you want to be seated right away.
other Mid size American airport with very good organization, very straight forward, no hassle. Security is a little slow and priority lane isn't really priority, it's more of "let's make fun of first class flyers getting pissed" lane, so let's welcome first class flyers with big giggle!! Many stores and food quality is okay. Seating areas are limited, at least for the Terminal 3 before security, so be aware. Lots of volunteers working here to guide you to the right place, there may be more volunteers than passengers. Haha.
other Woohoo is right. My hubby and I have gone a few times for happy hour and always enjoyed ourselves. Last night was the best so far. We were enjoying a few Left Hands and ordered the Tuesday night pizza special. It was other for other basically so we each ordered our fave. Apparently the GM thought my pizza was too done so he brought out the " burnt" one and already had another one cooking. I actually like my pizza that way but hey, I could understand where he was coming from. The second pizza was beautiful, a work of art. My husband's pie was great, all he kept saying was how great the crust was. I wil definitely bring all my friends and clients here. Special service too!  thanks again to Dan the general manager and our delicious server Reina ( sorry there isn't a better word,is there?)            Linda and Ron
other Wings are not my favorite type of food, and I find most "wing bars" to be about the same. So when the East Valley Friday Night (#EVFN) Tweetup headed here I didn't have high hopes.The wings were good, the beer was even better. I was honestly impressed by the excellent selection on tap, including some crazy stuff I had never head of before.  It satisfies both the Pickiest Vegetarian and Pickiest Beer Snob I know, so is on my list of places to take just about anyone to relax and have a good time.
other Bye bye Phoenix Houston's, hello Phoenix Hillstone!I've been a huge fan of Houston's for years, and had mixed emotions when I heard that they were closing the Phoenix location and opening just down the street under their parent company name, Hillstone.  But after one visit, I'm sold... Hillstone has the same favorite dishes that Houston's had (spinach dip, grilled artichoke, veggie burger, fresh vegetable sides, fries, desserts, etc...) and they have a huge wine list as well.  Service is attentive and sweet (thanks McKenna who was our waitress last night).  Thanks also for going above and beyond and creating rootbeer floats for our table upon request!The Hillstone group did a fabulous job building this new restaurant - it's got a great outdoor seating area, a huge bar, an awesome wine cellar, and comfy booths inside as well.If you still want the old name (Houston's), the location in Scottsdale / Hilton Village is still open, but I highly recommend checking out Hillstone to change it up just a bit.Welcome to Phoenix, Hillstone, and yay for me... first to review!
other I really like this place! Plenty of room, very organized. And is willing to help you out. Price is very acceptable @ $7.00 a day. They have ear plugs, targets and beverages to purchase at a reasonable price. If it's your first time there is a 10 min video they want you to watch. It's diffidently a great place to go, just have to watch out for dumb A$$ like myself. I tend to have a major brain freeze. But the workers there are nice enough to let me know what I did wrong in a polite way. Give me time! I promise I won't shoot anyone! I'll get better.
3 Here is my honest assessment of Los Reyes de la Torta.  It's a three-star place.  The atmosphere is a bit dumpy.  My apologies to those who think reviews should focus strictly on food, but atmosphere is what I notice when I walk in the door.  Plus, despite the fact that the place was mostly, we were led to the table closest to the restrooms.  Seriously?  The star of the show here is obviously the tortas.  I tried the egg one, which had cheese and a very generous serving of sliced avocados.  This torta was delicious and a great value.  The other one I tried had chicken, onions, and some other stuff.  It reminded me of what they have at the Great Steak and Potato Company.  Not that that's a bad thing.  For the tortas I give other stars.  Other stuff:No alcohol.  'Nuff said.Greasy potato chips as a side?  That was kind of a bummer.  I was craving tortilla chips or fries or anything a little more exciting than potato chips right out of the bag.The flan was really dense and tasted like it was prepared forever ago in a huge vat.  Skip it.  You probably won't be hungry anyway after the tortas so don't get tempted by the pictures on the menu.
other Perfect place for a hot summer day.  Amazing paletas!  Friendly staff and fresh ingredients.  Welcoming environment in downtown Chandler.
other The best food I have found the area and the price is right.  You get so much food you have to take home.  Get there early to get a good seat fills up for lunch.  Priced just right.
3 Whatza Culvers?  I drove by this place as it was being built; didn't know what it was, but "butterburger" and "frozen yogurt" caught my eye..... so I decided to visit it on 2011-05-30 (dine-in).  Looks like it just opened, and it was busy.Turns out this place is a fast-food chain based out of Wisconsin that I had never heard of before... kind of like a cross between an In-and-Out and a Dairy Queen.  Menu is a bit daunting the first time - a burger or a sandwich?  what side?  smoothies, or regular drinks?  You walk up to the counter, place your order, take your number to your table, and they deliver your order to your table when it's ready.The burger patties are different... they're about 1/8" thick and seem pressed/fried.  The buns are nice and soft... ingredients are fresh or properly cooked.  Flavors are there... but it is a different style burger than what we're used to seeing.  I tried the cheese curds; just wish they hadn't breaded/deep-fried them.  I like my curds natural.  A fountain drink completes the "value basket" deal.Their frozen yogurt or "concrete mix" sealed the deal.... we tried the banana split (nice) and their "brownie cookie dough".  Kinda hard to screw up frozen yogurt!  yum! Okay, so I now know what a Culvers is.  It's a good change-of-pace from the other fast food chains.  Not sure I'd go out of my way just to come here (unless I'm really in the mood for it).   I'll have to try other items, but for now, its a 3 star rating.
other This is one excellent Ethiopian restaurant, rivals anything I've sampled in Washington DC or Seattle.  If I lived in Phoenix, this would be a Top-other restaurant for me (along with Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles - yum!).Lalibela takes a slightly different approach to their menu.  Many of the entrees are offered as small portions ($4.50-$6.00 each).  They suggest each diner order 2-3 of these to make a meal. Kitfo and Lamb Tibs dishes are offered as full entrees and like many Ethiopian restaurants, you can order combo plates (meat combo, veggie combo, house combo plate etc.).  This made deciding on our meal a little more complicated, but also offered more flexibility for sampling different dishes.Our favorite dish ordered was the Lamb Tibs (the spicy version with Awaze spice paste).  Lamb was soooo tender, and the spices were a delight - rich in flavor but not too hot for those with tame palettes.  Good thing it comes as a full order - four of us were competing for bites!!  We ordered a half portion of Keye Wott (beef in a spicy brown sauce) that was some of the best I've ever had.  Again, rich in flavor but not too spicy.  My favorite Ethiopian meat dish is Kitfo - choice beef sort of like steak tartar (servered raw or lightly cooked) but with Ethiopian spices.  Lalibela's was pretty good, just not transcendent like the Lamb Tibs or Beef Keye Wott.  The vegetable dishes were on a whole excellent - especially the yellow lentils, gomen (collard greens) and spicy (Wott) lentils.Staff was great - attentive, helpful service.  Unlike some Ethiopian restaurants, this one is very user-friendly.  Although in some cases  the menu accommodates American tastes it doesn't compromise on quality or authenticity.  One note on the injera (sponge-like bread used to scoop up the entrees) - it's a mix of wheat flour and teff (a grain indigenous to Ethiopia) and I don't think it's fermented like injera that is made with 100% teff.  I'm used to the latter, but you can argue Lalibela's injera doesn't compete with the flavor of the entrees as much.All in all, one of the best Ethiopian restaurants I've been to, and I have been to many in the States.  Only problem now is whether my favorite Ethiopian restaurants in Seattle will still taste as good!  Highly, highly recommended.
other I have shared many an awful, hungover morning with my favorite stars from the Gay Corridor. The service can be on the scary tweaker side, but it's a good, simple breakfast that doesn't stress my dehydrated mind to find deliciousness. They've also many different healthy options, not that I've ever done more than glance at those, but it's wonderful nonetheless. It's the crown and glory of Park Central, and the only reason I still consider Park Central an actual place, as opposed to the reality of it just being a bad idea.
other Well what can i say, if you like a club atmosphere and girls have naked walking around at night  this is your type of place.  It felt to me like this hotel was trying to be a hotel that you would find in vegas.  the rooms are overpriced, there is no storage in them and they give you like other hangers total.  The water here is awful so dont drink it.  The pool area is nice, and the room service is very quick.  So those aspects of this hotel are nice.  I am not sure i would spend 300 buks to stay here though again.  I am not really into the party scene but if you are this might be your kind of place.  Id rather be at a pub bar or sports bar personally but to each their own!
other My co-workers and I refer to this place as "Pizza n' Ants".  The staff will be happy to serve you with bare hands, right after using the till.  Also, as the nickname suggests, there has been a noticable insect problem. As if that could all be overlooked, the pizza isn't even good.  If you are in this part of town, go to Z Pizza or Slices for great pizza instead!
other Great Mom/Pop store! We've stopped by several times for some fresh produce and to get treats for the kids. We usually sit outside on one of tha picnic tables to eat gelato, while the kids love playing/petting all the animals. Thanks!
other I only recently discovered that I do not hate Thai, having never tried it, so this place was right up my alley. It's literally other mile away from our home and has a pretty extensive menu. The atmosphere is nothing to write home about, but if you're a fan of pastels and the early 90s, you'll love it here. You may even want to move in. Our service was a little slow, but the friendliness of our servers (yes, multiple) made me feel ok about waiting a little bit for a third beer. Overall, I'd say this gets a thumbs up from me and my other half.
3 Great bar with a friendly bartender named "Bob"
other MARGARITA time....I love their ritas on the rocks!!! Their shrimp tacos are my favorite in town. I love the salsa bar. The wait staff has always been nice. The prices of  food and drink are great. This is a great place to go with friends to eat good mexican food & kick back a few drinks. The patio area is nice all year round.
other I love Coach.Stylish and trendy without spending an obscene amount of money on a bag. Sure they are still a bit more pricey than a purse at Target, but you are paying for name. The sales associates are really nice and won't hesitate talking to you. I only have a few things from Coach because usually I can't justify spending to much money to accessories, but anything you buy here you can use forever. A coach bag will probably never go out of style.
other A definite welcome to the neighborhood!! I was delightfully surprised at how much the store offers in such a small space. Grant it you are not going to get many choices on some items, but you may be surprised at some of the items you do find. There were plenty of choices for organic foods and "green" products, also. The good:convenience - for those of you that has one in your neighborhood. Easy to get in and out of with front door parking.PRICE - The prices are as low as Walmart's but without the hassle of having to deal with the super-store size. (they accept coupons too - even better) Ready meals - Great concept. Many places do this, but I found that it was easy (and fun) to create a full meal. Main courses, salads, sides, sandwiches and desserts all labeled and located in one place. If you don't have time to cook give it a shot. It is not as cheap as cooking it yourself but lasagna for two people for six bucks isn't bad. The bad:Stay away from the Rotisserie Chicken. A little dry and over-cooked. I've had better at Fry's, Costco. Save your tastebuds.In a world of Mega-stores with mega-parkiing lots it is nice to have a place that is actually cheaper to go to and within walking distance. The best way to describe Marketside is if you were to cram the Walmart food section and the Wholefoods quality and organic cool factor  in a space the size of Walgreens.
other They play two kinds of music here: country and western.  The place is about the size of my one bedroom apartment.  It's a dive for sure.  It's cheap though.  But cash only.  The food is actually not too bad for bar food.  Overall this place doesn't impress much, but considering you don't have a lot of choices for Laveen, you can't really compalin either.
other I love Sapporo.  They have reasonable prices, a big menu, great music always playing, entertainment (people watching), etc...Their sushi is very good.  They have fun drinks.  If you make a reservation for dinner you usually don't have to wait.P.S.  They have amazing deals for happy hour, but get there early cause it gets packed!!
other I've got to admit, fishing at the Water Ranch pond kind of makes me think of the Beverly Hillbillie's "cement pond".  But I really like it!  The location is perfect; right at the intersection of Guadalupe & Greenfield.  Parking is no problem.  The walk from car to water is little more than a skip, hop and a jump.  Very easy for my elderly dad to take my son fishing.  The fishing is easy too.  The pond is stocked with Trout, Bass, Catfish and Sunfish.  We've been catching nice trout (10-1other inches, Yum!) using nightcrawlers.  I'm keep hearing that white power bait works too.  Although the bottom of the pond seems to have several rocks, snags don't ever seem to be a problem.  Maybe best of all, the edge of the pond is a cement curbed sidewalk.  Like I said, Jethro Bodine would be right at home.  I suppose if you are gonna be an "Urban Fisherman" you might as well do it right!Not much into fishing?  No problem.  There is a wonderful library with windows looking out over the pond.  There are paths for a nice walk.  There are birds everywhere.  There is even some kind of observatory (haven't checked it out yet, don't know the details).All-in-all, this place is exactly what you'd want... and more.
3 I have been to Kyoto about 3-other times in the past 7 years.  I still hasn't changed a bit since the first time I went there when I was fifteen!  I always eat at the grills.  I love places with the tepanaki (I dont know how to spell it) grills.  I have been to many many places like this and Kyoto is just ok.  This place needs some serious redecorating.  It looks like the place is stuck in the 1970's.  The food is good though.  Last time our grill cook was really bad and was droping things all over the place but hey everyone has an off day sometimes.  I may go here again just because its so close to my home but otherwise I've had better.
3 Arrived around 5pm one Wednesday evening. The place is not in a nice area of Phoenix, and it looked deserted, and I was going to leave, when I saw a Mercedes and Lexus pull up.  So I thought I'd give it a chance. The prices were somewhat reasonable, I got the Lo-Lo's for $1other (other waffles, and 3 pieces of fried chicken). The food was tasty for what it was, but I only give it 3 *'s because its just so unhealthy.. kool-aid, waffles, syrup, and fried chicken! This is the kinda a place I may go once a year, but I just feel so guilty!  Not sure what the syrup was, but it certainly wasn't real maple syrup (I'd imagine it is some sugar based creation), and the waffles were dry. The chicken wasn't very moist, it was also a bit on the dry side.
other This dog park gets one star.Why?Because the last time I went,some piece of shit broke into just about every car in the parking lot to steal whatever they could.So much broken glass from side windows everywhere.It used to be okay before this incident,but a busy parking lot in borad daylight and some vulture lies in wait?Yeah,I'm done here.
other Completely shady.  Towed our U-haul as we were moving in to our new Apartment Complex.  Completely unethical and total crooks.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
other This was stop numero uno on our group's light rail bar crawl.  None of us had ever been there before so we were excited to see what this place was all about.Situated about a 10ish minute walk from the light rail station, it is a nice walk through a part of town where I wouldn't normally be.  You wouldn't think this place is a brewery because of its small size but it is.  The inside is very quaint and taverny.  It has a very relaxed vibe going on.I ordered the sampler and all their beers are pretty decent.  I decided on the Amber for my pint, but they were all good so it was a difficult decision.  Not bad for a little local brewery at all.  For a quick bite before we moved on we ordered the calamari and the bratwurst splitter.  The calamari was pretty standard and the aioli had a nice kick to it.  The bratwurst was excellent and unique.  Each was perfect to split among other people.  The rest of their menu looked good but is pretty much typical bar food.  Well probably a bit better than average bar food.  Anyway, it is perfect food for the place and looking back we should have probably eaten dinner there instead of only an appetizer.Pro Tip:  Cross over to the north side of the street at the light as soon as you exit the light rail station.  Otherwise you will be dodging traffic as you try to cross because the place is located on the other side of the street far from another crosswalk.Anyway, I would like to come back for a few beers and food.  I would also like to do the brewery tour.
other One word to describe this hotel: quality. The pools were all warm and unique. The hotel has two hot tubs, one that changes colors at night and is next to a man made stream, the other is on its own "island". There are two pools, a lazy river, and a small pool. The rooms were comfortable and the whole facility was clean. One thing that must be commented on is the staff was not only efficient but they were very friendly and nice. All of the food and room service I ordered was filled with superb flavor and had good presentation. The hotel also has a botanical garden, herb garden, multiple lawns, and it contains different food services. I highly recommend the ranchero pulled pork tacos and the sushi. The Marriott burger, creme  brûlée, drinks, and fromage board was very good.
other My buddy and I (along with our dogs) stop by here every morning on the way to dog park. Hot coffee and hot women making the coffee! Love this place!
other This is definitely the best Indian restaurant in Phoenix. The tandoori chicken and aloo tikki wraps are to die for. You cannot go wrong with this place!
other If you're looking for a board game, card game or, well, ANY game you can't find at GameStop, try here! Their selection is huge, from games to figurines to key chains and novelty candy. Better yet, they're friendly and really seem to know what they're talking about. They also offer in-store tournaments and competitions. So much fun!
3 As much as you don't want to like Wally World...it is what it is...crazy!!
other The food was amazing and beautifully presented. The atmosphere was clean, quiet, serene.
other Wow! I can't believe this place gets so many good reviews. I was hauled here once by co-workers looking for a cheap meal. But, how much value does your lunch dollar have when you don't even want to eat the food? Dry and sticky rice; "white meat chicken" unidientifiable as such, and a sweet glaze that provided the only flavor. Quite frankly, it was disgusting, and none of the dishes my co-workers had looked any better (though they seemed to be fine with them). I should know to stay away from restaurants that have pictures of their menu items on the wall. The one star is only for the fast and friendly service.
other I went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago with my bosses. It was packed on a Friday - we sat at the bar and our cook was fantastic! We got to sit and chat with him while he worked away at the orders. I had the chicken pesto pasty and it was wonderful! the bread used is similar to a pastry dough type...but not as sweet. The pasty was so filling, I could barely finish it.My bosses have been there before and have always wanted to try the peanut butter and jelly pasty - so we all split it as dessert and it was so good. They put bananas in it and drizzle jelly over the whole pasty. It's definitely rich and gooey. I would totally go back here again and have told my friends about it too! Amazing place.
other I was super excited to find a place in Arizona that has vegetarian pho!The service was just mediocre.  It met basic requirements without any friendliness.Very cost effective= CHEAP.
other Yeah, yeah, I know there are already like fifty-something reviews for this place, most of them four or five stars, I don't care. Here's one more, another twig on the bonfire celebrating Richardson's awesomeness...The food's the same awesome New Mexican cuisine as Dick's Hideway around the corner, but eating here is a totally different experience. The dark pueblo interior with Native American rugs surrounding the high-backed booths provides a great deal of privacy for you and your party. I recommend any and all of the seafood dishes - my favorites include the shrimp quesadilla and the scallops... OMG the scallops, so good when I think about 'em they make me lose control and type text message shorthand like "OMG". Of course my friends constantly remind me that as much as I love the food here, I can't truly appreciate it because I don't eat the meat dishes, which, according to them, are even better. And they're probably right. They usually are.Went with a group of 6 last week, which seems to be about as large as the booths at Richardson's can handle (for much larger groups there's a private room available at Dick's). Service was super friendly and extremely efficient. Yeah, it can be a little pricy depending on what you order, but in my opinion, totally worth it. Sometimes you gotta splurge.
other Been to the Saigon Kitchen 3 times now.  Once with a friend, another with my teenage daughter and other on a lunch date with my husband.  Will have to say have been absolutely pleased each time.  I ordered the Shaken beef (diced Filet Mignon) each time.  Husband ordered the Chicken Curry (which he liked) and we enjoyed egg rolls.  The food has been hot, tastes fresh, excellent presentation and absolutely delicious.  Portions, in my opinion, are definitely a good portion---just right.  Entree is served with white rice, soup/broth, and a tasty shredded side salad with a great Asian dressing.  Staff was polite and attentive, food came out in a timely manner.  Have thoroughly enjoyed my experience each time.   They play nice "Global Ambient" music, the restaurant is somewhat small yet cozy.  It has a nice "grown up" simple Asian feel.  Definitely a great place to meet a significant other or good friend to lunch.  NOT a place I would recommend for children; tables are somewhat close together and it has a relaxing feel.  Menu seemingly NOT designed with kids meals etc.  Also a bit expensive if considering price.  Hubby and I each had the Shaken Beef lunch with egg roll appetizer and drinks, it came out to $39.    Worth the money, but if you are watching budget on a lunch date, just something to consider.We definitely have listed this as a favorite place for us to dine sans kids!
other Yikes, reading other reviews I realize my bad experience wasn't unique. As a server I make a very laid back customer. I like pretty much everything I eat and don't require a lot of attention from the waiter. La Piccola Cucina would benefit from just one extra person in the front of the house. Our guy, though adorable and friendly, was too busy to refill our drinks and to remember to bring our appetizer (though charged us for it). The ahi tuna (highly recommended over the other fish options he said) was so overcooked it was the color and consistency of chicken. Like other reviewers mentioned, he was frantic and made that clear to every customer. At one point I even saw him in the kitchen cooking - they need another person! I left super stressed out from the experience, which is very, very unusual for me. You can either have bad service or bad food, but not both.
other Dropped into this joint just wandering around Old Town Scottsdale. Ordered the nachos and had a couple margs. WOW. The staff was friendly, have a great sense of humor (you gotta see the posted picture joke in person), and the food is...beyond good. Having only sampled the uber nacho plate, which is by the way, as big as a platter and slathered in layers of ooey gooey cheesy goodness, I can definitively say: Best. Ever. I give this place the highest marks for "doesn't suck"
other This is my favorite breakfast/brunch spot. Fresh bagels and different types of cream cheese.They even have Bagel Thins for those who are cutting their carbs. You don't pay the person who took you order, but move down the line to pay for your food.Their iced coffee are a great deal!! It's a 20oz cup for less than $3!
other This is a great Radio Shack.  The staff are older, and very knowledgeable with their product line.  If you need odd batteries, check this store out first.  I needed a watch battery, and found that they were the only store in Phoenix to carry it.  It cost be all of $other bucks, but saved me having to buy a new watch.
other If I had written this review prior to an incident in September it would easily be other stars.The bar tenders were awesome.  One night I was carrying around a largeish trophy (Why because I own one).  I put it on the bar to order beer and they asked me if I wanted a glass or if I wanted them to put it in the trophy.  Yes, yes I did (although they did have to pour the drink into the glass first cause the trophy was to big to properly fit under the tap).  This might not be a big deal to some, but since I've been kicked out of bars for drinking out of said trophy before and that was the first time I've ever had a bar tender be so cool about it.  Every time I've been hear the bar staff has rocked even when they are extremely busy.Food.  I think I've eaten here once, so I'm not going to comment on it.  However I have been here when they switch from neighborhood bar mode to dance bar mode.  If you are at a table still eating at that time they have no hesitation moving your table out of the way, if you're lucky they will tell you about it before hand.It's a good place for watching football/UFC/etc.  Could maybe use some more TV's.  Music is nothing outstanding, it's your typical dance/top 40's/etc that you would expect at any college dance bar.  Since the crowd often is college/recent grads, it fits the bar nicely.I don't normally include bouncers in my reviews, but after what I saw the last time I was there, it's affected my opinion of the place and is the reason the place is only getting other stars.  If you are kicking someone out and the are leaving peacefully, there is no reason to put your hands on him, other than maybe to keep him from falling over the place.  So when I see a bouncer aggressively pushing a guy who has thrown up his hands in surrender, and in the process the bouncer knocks over a girl who has done nothing wrong, that's just not cool.  Maybe it's just me but I would think someone who works for the bar should be picking her up off the ground instead of nearly trampling her to help the bouncer who put her there while throwing out someone who is giving them no resistence on his way out.
other Brought a group to Metro for brunch, made the reservation a month ago, called three days ago to update and ask to be outside and people arrived and were told there was no reservation. Finally spoke with the manager and had that sorted out but when I asked for our tables outside and they couldn't accommodate. Having the bartender wait on a party of 18 was idiotic. Not enough menus, slow, horrible drinks, no silverware, soup was burnt-how do you burn soup??? Attempting to fix the situation with beignets was a nice attempt until we heard the server swearing about having to deal with us. I host events all over the valley and never have I experienced service as horrible as I did at Metro. They have recently changed management, unfortunately the great reviews I read when I made the reservation don't hold true anymore.Update 11/8/2010Since my first review I received a $50 gift certificate from the management of Metro.  I decided to go for dessert last Friday night with other of my friends.  I knew I couldn't just go with one other person, it had to be a group to show what they could do.  We arrived at 9:1other and were seated on the patio.  I met the general manager and she was pleasant enough, I never saw her again.  There was no one seated inside and the patio was half full.Jesse greeted us and was the most attentive and understanding server when two guests needed to return their drinks to the bar because they were not made properly - it was a specialty drink from their cocktail menu.We ordered beignets, apple bread pudding and triple chocolate delight.  The beignets and apple bread pudding were good.  The triple chocolate delight had absolutely no chocolate flavor at all.Jesse was by far an excellent server and if you go ask to be seated in his section.
other Awesome!!!
other Lunch was delicious, as usual. I had the bruschetta trio for the first time and I couldn't find anything wrong with it, much as I tried to. Not even the onions bothered me. And if you know me, you know how much I hate onions. But their bruschetta was so full of all my favorite flavors I couldn't even complain about the onions. Now that's saying something.
other Thai, Vietnamese a nice patio, good happy hour and a swanky inside they have it all.Despite being a nicer place as Asian food goes the prices are quite reasonable and it is really a great value. The happy hour menu has Asian tappas (apps) for $other and many $other cocktails and glasses of wine. WE had the salmon satay which was just grilled cubes of salmon on a stick with sauce and some salad, good but nothing special. The veggie wontons were great in a brown sauce and filled with veggies and again a small salad garnish.My cocktail was great but it was a bit strong.For our mains we had the Salmon with green curry, It came in a HUGE Bowl it was rich and full of great veggies and fresh not overcooked fish. $12.95We also had the dragon noodles, which was veggies tofu and glass noodles. It was light and fresh. ~10Over all great quality value and patio I will be back.
other My boyfriend and I stopped by to grab a bite to eat before work and long story short-Greeted immediately -Lots of variety-Meat lovers pizza is amazing-Ask for Tawnya she's really nice and a wonderful server -Will be back, loved the excellent service!!
other Worst enchiladas EVER and decor from a 1980's attempt at a mexican restaurant.  Taco Bell is a step up!  But if you like soupy enchiladas drowning in cheez wiz this is the place for you.
other This restaurant is close to my office, so it is a regular stop for either a great Mexican breakfast or lunch. Never been dissapointed, nor have any of my co workers. Try the Huevos Rancheros or the Chiliquiles ( With the Green Sauce ), it is a favorite.
other I went there last night with bf to celebrate our anniversary. After pre-yelp, we knew what to expect as to prices, so it wasn't so much of a shocker.To the food, we concur with almost everyone here. It was impeccable! We ordered the ice tower for other and thought that it was very well presented. Ours came with 3 appetizers (raw oysters, crab claws and dungeness crab) so it wasn't too high. They are all fresh. Growing up I used to go to the beach quite often just to have fresh crabs, so I know what those taste like. And for 6 years living in the desert, Mastro's is the first and only one in AZ to deliver that.  For main course, I got Ivory Salmon "Oreganata", bf got Swordfish blackened. I am quite picky when it comes to fish, and bf isn't exactly a fish person, but both of our dishes "surpassed expectation." I couldn't say much about swordfish except it was fresh. We had the same dish other weeks before at somewhere else, it was nowhere near as sweet and fresh as the one at Mastro's. It was my first having Ivory Salmon, it was sweeter, and white (hence the name) than normal salmon we get around here. Mine was good size portion, firm to the touch, but melted in the mouth. The flavor was subtle enough to enjoy by itself, or you can add one of the sauces provided. One of my favorite sauces of the night I think was made of minced tomatoes and olives, came with the main course.Sides were Lobster Mash and Snap peas. I didn't really care for snap peas as I can make them at home. But lobster mash is a MUST for those who go there. I'm not sure how they prepared it, but it felt like mash potatoes made with lobster bisque (instead of water and milk) and added lobster chunks. It was much more flavorful and creamy than a normal mash potatoes. It was big enough to share and take home. One thing though, it hardened up after sitting out for awhile, so I'm not sure if microwave could make it all fluffy again after other night in the fridge.Drinks there are amazing, from the presentation, to the taste, and definitely the amount of alcohol in each drink. We decided to go with cocktail drinks rather than wines because of other yelpers' reviews. Total worth it!!!The service was amazing. We had Robert. We pretty much asked him for recommendations for everything, yet he was nice about it and very knowledgeable. Next time we go back, I would definitely ask for him again.We didn't order dessert since they gave us a dark-chocolate "Happy Anniversary" cake with the letters written, also, in chocolate. The overall experience was other 3/4, just because it was a bit difficult talking to each other. The acoustic of the room wasn't very good and it got loud. Didn't see much of cougar/manther scene as we were in the dining room. And maybe it was during weekdays, we saw lots of "expense account" people though
other I stayed at the Motel right across the street from this restaurant when I stayed in Gila Bend. I had been driving all day through the hot desert and really wanted to kick back with a cold beer and some good food. Little Italy did not disappoint!! I got a large pizza that was AMAZING!! Plus the service was great too. Fast and friendly.
other I went there with a friend last year after reading so many good reviews. The service is good. We didn't have to wait but I didn't like the food I ordered. I had a salmon with caper butter sauce. The fish is not fresh at all and the food is too geasy for me.
other Yes, this place can be a bit pricey, however if you catch them at happy hour or on "girls night out" it can be very affordable. The atmosphere and the "specialness" of the melting pot is unbeatable. I have been there for intimate occasions, and family birthdays. Food is wonder, especially the cheese! The menu has changed a bit over the years, and there are some oldies I would love to see return (the mushroom salad), but there is nothing that beats this place for any special occasion
other This place is absolutely wonderful. My boyfriend and I have been here for a few special occasions and have never been dissappointed, the food is amazing and the service is just as good, our waiter was so unbelievably nice. Their steak could possibly be the best steak I have ever eaten, and their creme brulee is to die for. This place even does complimentary filet mignon sandwiches for happy hour...guarantee you will love this place just as much as we do!
3 Very well done pizza...its like a pizza pillow, tasty, savory and rather doughy.This is not my favorite style of pizza but nonetheless it was especially good pizza.  The service staff was top notch and the store is very warm and inviting.We will be back!
other Need your Bianco fix but don't want to wait in line for three hours or get in a fight because of a shortcutter? Eat here instead. Take out only and very limited menu but who cares there food is great! Lucky for me I live close by so I can bring it home. There sandwiches are made with all fresh ingredients and their bread is wonderful. Next door is a place called Lux Coffee House. Erick is a hoot. They are very good to their customers and I had the best Vanilla Latte every here. You can sit here with your Bianco sandwich and surf the net with your laptop. A small piece of paradise!!!!!!Be forewarned Bianco's is not cheap!
other Love, love, LOVE this place!  Eugenia is a genius!  Macarons = amazing.  Croissants = soft, buttery, flaky, delicious goodness.  Iced mocha is one of the best I have ever had.  My only complaint is that this place is not closer to my house or work, but that's probably a good thing because I would weigh 1000 lbs if it was.
3 Do to have that ONE review you just keep putting off and dont care to write it? Thats the post office for me. You get what you get, and you get it here. It's like a review of a place that no matter what any of us write, it'll never change. One thing I'd LOVE to see, especially once the Snow Birds return... A speed line. Just a basic line for basic transactions. I always use the automatic machines as often as I can, but it always seems the times I have to wait in line, it's always out the door and takes forever. Stick to mornings and late afternoons. Skip on weekends!
other 4-other locations.. all 4.other star average.. I think Arizona really has some fantastic Pizza options, and Spinatos is at the top of my pizza fix list.. the semi sweet sauce is addictive, great service, fresh ingredients, The Spicy Italian is my favorite... The chocolate chips cookies are laced with mind altering drugs, that make your body parts"romantic" when you think of their cookies.. BTW 5:30pm, on a Tuesday, when we left, a 30 minute wait.. Its on the List..
other So sad to say, I have to change my rating from other stars to 1.  I had been a faithful customer of Katie's for years, at least 3 or 4!  She told me she wasn't going to be doing nails anymore because she had developed carpal tunnel.  I was heartbroken.  But she told me she was training the others in her shop to be able to do nails like her so I figured I would continue to go there.  Next appt I needed, I called and scheduled and said it doesn't matter with who because Katie isn't doing nails anymore, right?  I was then told that Katie is still doing nails but she was full that day.  Very hurtful!  I always tipped her VERY well and was always willing to work with her schedule.  But needless to say, I don't go there anymore, haven't been there since I ended up cancelling that appt and going elsewhere.
other Finally Biltmore gets a sushi place after the departure of Ayako! Well if you have been to Stingray in Old Town Scottsdale, this is same menu, etc. But I happened to like the atmosphere at this location better!Came here for a happy hour, had a drink called the Tokyo Tease(delish!) and since I love sashimi sushi (which isn`t on the happy hour menu, no big deal), ordered my sashimi combo, which didn`t disappoint!! Included tuna, salmon and yellowtail. Did enjoy the bevy of assorted rolls that went by. I like the outside/inside seating bar- great on beautiful weather days! I will be back for more!!
3 Just OK.  But like pizza and sex, there really is no bad BBQ.  I think there is something lost in translation from its Texas roots to AZ.  Gone is the appeal of the gas station dive.  Atmosphere feels a little phony in a pretty, new building.  The biggest problems I have with the food is the overpowering mesquite flavor and mediocre sauces.  The Texas roots explains the loyalty to mesquite, which is understandable and you cant fault them for staying true... but a little hickory or less creosote-tasting smoke would be nice for a non-Texas palette.  The sauces seem a little amateur.  I know Rudy's is no amateur in the business, but I think they settled too soon on their signature sauces - they taste like the first ones I made in my backyard.  If a true amateur (me) can evolve into better sauces, so can Rudys.  Now I need to stop at the new BBQ joint next door to see which one will get my BBQ dollars... stay tuned.
other Okay before I get into the drinks, I'll start with the food.  My fave is the peppered turkey avocado sandwich, with these delicious fries.  Or, (Amber: note the paragraph change) you could get the chili verde appetizer, or the grilled shrimp and guac tostada bites, or the tejas trio with guac, queso, and salsa and chips.  Bottom line is the food is solid, all the way up to the fruit cobbler for dessert.  Settle for nothing less. For drinks, Z caps you at 3 margaritas so make it count with the chambord rita before you switch to beers.  It's good, you'll be flavored, life is perfect.
other Fantastic, order anything off the menu and you will be pleasantly surprised.  Best gyro I've ever had hands down and the falafel is equally amazing.  Owner paid special attention to my boyfriend and I and made sure we were happy with everything.  Only downside is that they close for a couple hours during the day before dinner time (I believe its 2:30 to 5:30 or something like that) so I can't eat their delicious food whenever I want, haha, keep on doing what you're doing Sahara.
3 if you want a really filling, delicious "please-make-my-head-stop-feeling-like-it's-about-to-explode" hangover cure, there guys have got the remedy!  the hangover helper is all of the above and get's even better when you add the hair of the dog bloody mary for an extra $3! (they also have live music on sundays during brunch!)the architecture and windows are stunning in this place - if you've never been in here, it's worth checking it out!
other Love the pita jungle!!!  My fave is the chicken and hummus appetizer.  Definitely enough for a meal and super cheap too.  Also love the chicken swarma sandwich and the chicken pizza.  You can't go wrong here.
other Best Thai I have found in Phoenix, so far.  This is not just excellent Thai food for Phoenix, this is excellent Thai food for the Bay Area.  It's that good.  Thai Lahna's food will intrude into your thoughts for days after you eat here.  Like gustatory flashbacks, you will find yourself thinking about how wonderfully flavorful everything was.We had dinner here with Christine O & Myles (+1) and shared other appetizers and other entrees.  We had Chicken Satay and Angel Wings.  The Satay was the least interesting item we had, it was merely good.  Everything else was great.Our entrees were Phaht Thai which we ordered with no spice and Khung Nahm Prik Pow which was sauteed shrimp with roasted curry paste, onions, chili, bell peppers and mushrooms.  Our friends ordered a spicy pineapple fried rice and a beef dish which I can't recall the name of.  All of the dishes were richly flavorful and had plenty of sauce to carry over to the steamed rice.One enjoyable highlight was the point counter-point going from the spicy heat of the rice to the almost sweet sauciness of the Phaht Thai.  We can't wait to get back here and try more dishes.My only complaint about this place is that they need to put some sort of tinting on the windows to a height of about 3 feet.  When cars are pulling into the spots right in front of the restaurant some diners were blinded by the headlights.
other there is one problem with bagel nosh: it's not close enough to tempe! went there on a sunday a little before closing-the bagel selection was sparse but they offered to get us any kind of bagel we wanted. the garlic,feta, and dill cream cheese was amazing and the breakfast sandwich looked hella yummy! went to get a refill on our way out and the owner offered a free large glass of iced tea since they were about to close. the service was great andi might have to make the trip out there very soon!
other Love it. Wish it was in my neighborhood.
other Pretty good. Excellent deals for happy hour.  The vegetable tempura, miso soup, salad, beef teriyaki, chicken teriyaki, california rolls, and crunch rolls were very good.  The spicy tuna was a little bland. Our children even enjoyed the food.
other This is the best Cajun place in Arizona. The portions are great and the people behind the counter are really nice. I love gumbo and I have tried several kinds here and all of them were excellent. Yes the decor isn't other stars but seriously if you're more worried about mood lighting and soft cushions you can go to Pappadeaux's and get charged an arm and a leg for lower quality food. the drive and the price are definitely worth it for this place.
other Roast beef sandwich at lunch is literally the best I've had. Cooked to order. Had mine rare.
other This place does it right, but hold on to your walet! U have to try the Yellow butter cake, its over the top.
other LOVE LOVE LOVE this office!  During my high-risk pregnancy I spent a lot of time at this office and in the hospital.  Both Dr. Hahn and Dr. Spieker were fantastic, very knowledgable and easy to talk to.  I trust them completly as they did everything to ensure both myself and my baby were well taken care of.   I have since seen Dr. Cyr for a quick appointment whom is very sweet.
other Amazing food! Great waiting staff, and the drink I ordered was very good and had the right amount of liquor. I will be coming back to this place for sure!
other I love the place.  Was a bit hesitant at first but friends recommended it, and it turned out to be quite good.  They even have a few choices for those that aren't into Asian fare.
other This restaurant is inside the Baiz Market!  So, don't waste your time trying to GPS it- just GPS Baiz market!Secondly, ambiance or quick service are probably not the reasons you'd come to eat inside an outdated restaurant on styrofoam plates.The food, however, is pretty tasty.  They have a wide variety of items typical to Middle Eastern cuisine: shawarmas, falafel, kebabs, pies, and more.  They heat items up in an open oven and the food comes out very fresh and hot!I tried the cheese pie and shawarma.  Both items were very good.  I still got onions when I asked for them to be excluded.  I suggest skipping their small beverage options in the adjacent cooler and going to the selection on the south side of the store for a better deal and variety.All in all, it is definitely worth trying out, especially if you are going to Baiz Market anyway!
other I am furious.In the last 1other months, I have had at least scheduling issues, from them calling me at 8AM on a Saturday morning (my other day off) to cancel my 11am appointment to last Saturday, when I went in only to be told someone had messed up, and actually booked me for the NEXT week, and despite me driving all the way out there at 11am, they couldn't get me in until maybe that evening, and then not with someone who had experience in deep tissue/medical massage. I was irritate and ready to ask for my membership refunded then, but Ashley the clinic manager promised me that they'd give me my next week appointment free of charge, and that she'd personally be certain there were no more issues.  As I literally couldn't turn my head to the left due to pain, I took her up on that. BIG MISTAKE.Yesterday (the Friday before my "correctly" scheduled massage, I went out of my way to call in and confirm my own bloody appointment, to try and avoid last week's debacle. According to the woman who answered the phone, it looked like my schedule therapist was actually scheduled off, but she went to talk with her manager, and came back to the phone telling me everything was ok, and that she'd call with any issues. Then yesterday evening, I got ANOTHER confirmation call from Massage Envy, confirming and reminding me of my 11:30am appt on Saturday with my preferred therapist. GIven that I've had 3 migraines this week (versus my 0 or other when I get a massage the weekend prior), I really absolutely needed to get in, so I felt more confident.Well, I was just woken up at 8am...again. On my day off...again. To explain to me that, big shock, they messed up my scheduling again, and that apparently, my therapist was off today. Despite Ashley's promise of it not happening again. Despite me being pro-active and calling to confirm. I am sitting here in pain, so furious at this repeated treatment that I can't even go back to bed...and the best part? They don't even have a manager on duty I can complain to.My treatment at the hands of the booking/front desk staff has been any thing BUT relaxing. I continue to walk out of there frustrated, angry, and occasionally in tears. I know they say Fool Me Once, Shame On You, Fool Me Twice, Shame On Me, but I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. I'm pretty screwed for today and the next week, but luckily, an Elements place with a similar concept opened recently in the general area. At this point, it literally cannot be any worse than massage envy. As much as I love Talisha and Aisha as massage therapists, getting a massage should feel good, and not like you're just a number to them, not like you actually have to spend more time trying to get a damn appointment than you actually get to spend IN the appointment.
other This review will be short and sweet. I promise!I was able to have breakfast here with the guys as our weekend was coming to an end and it was pretty darn good. I ordered the pancakes with scrambled eggs and extra crispy bacon. YUM! Dennis ordered the Mardi Gras omelet with fruit and I swear the is the second time this weekend he had mardi gras something. The first was mardi gras pasta over at pappadeaux. Hmm I see a theme lol. JD ordered eggs and chicken sausage and let me just say I have never heard the word sausage sound as naughty as it did with these two around. Even our server Steven was blushing by the time we left.All in the the service was good, the food was good and the company was awesome.  I will have to come back and try lunch or dinner one day soon.
other We've eaten at Taneko twice now, and while we like it, it's awful expensive for what you get, and I prefer a more authentic Japanese environment.Taneko starts off wanting to be a Japanese-style pub restaurant, but ends up throwing way too much Scottsdale into it creating a rather pretentious yet still yummy restaurant.The food is excellent - I enjoy the pork meal that has the stupidly spicy mustard sauce.  My kid likes the fried rice, though it is a little too much on the ginger side.  There's a gimmicky hot-rock appetizer where you cook pieces of steak on a super hot rock.  It's way too expensive for what little meat you get, but it's an awful lot of fun.The service is excellent as well, though maybe a little too servile for my tastes.  The wait staff go WAY out of their way to make you comfortable and quickly take care of any needs.  I just don't care for all of the introductions - I'm not going to remember the names of the other or other people bringing me stuff.  Still, I think that's the Scottsdale influence.  Not bad, but not really my thing.Overall, I've enjoyed both of the meals that I ate at Taneko, but with better places to eat real Japanese food like Yasu, Sea Saw, Hiro's and even Sakana, I'm probably not going back real soon.
other Clean, comfortable, smoke-free, fast service, nice staff.Also, their complimentary breakfast had a nice variety of food items. There is juice and coffee; bagels, yogurts, waffles and cereals.The hotel was a lot nicer than I expected, and I would definitely stay here again.
other This has to be the best Thai food around. I have tried a few other places, but none are as authentic and delicious as Swaddee. We are now regulars and have never been disappointed.
other The only place I go for a nice lunch on Mill. Two words: Beet Salad. Thank me later.
3 Very cute, pretty good sandwich and coffee.  This is a pretty good place to stop in between shopping sprees.  They have really good/healthy sandwiches and good coffee drinks.  *Service = really fast and nice*Food = good and healthy*Atmosphere = relaxing and cute*Brownie = yummy :)
other I'm not a big "organic" kind of guy.  I could care less about hormone free this and BPA free that.  For me it all about flavor and service - it has to be better than I can make it myself and you have to take better care of us than I can.Having said that, I'm HEAD OVER HEELS in love with the food at Tryst!  Service is family oriented too.  They treat you like a regular on your first trip in the door and burgers are to die for.As a die-hard burger man, this is my default stop.  It is close to the house, in a pleasant shopping center, and has the best burger I've ever eaten in Phoenix.  I'd give it an extra half star if Yelp would let me.  This place is that good!
other This is by far one of the best subways I've ever been to! 9 times out of 10, you go into subway, order a sandwich, and the employees either do a poor job of making the sandwich or they skimp on ingredients bc their bosses are cheap bastards! This Subway has a fun, laid back manager, and cheerful employees that make a BOMB sandwich every time, thus restoring my faith in Subway! They are true sandwich artists!
other My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here for the first time. I have nothing but good things to say. Food, wait staff and overall experience were excellent. This is an old school type of steakhouse with red velvet wallpaper, leather booths, etc. If you haven't been, I can't recommend it highly enough. Give it a try and you'll be glad you did!
other Yes, it's pricey, so I got a membership. Yes, the membership is pricey - but if you go frequently (and you'll want to with the hot summer months) you'll get your money's worth and then some. The place is big enough that you can do different exhibits for each trip. Great place to take the grandparents to watch the kids in their element, too!
other I would eat here again. The breakfast is good but super fatty!  Be prepared to eat a meal that makes it so you do not have to eat for the rest of the day.
other This place is awesome they r going to replace a bad  tire for me for free that another discount tire put on they r awesome
other Same as the others... Clean, friendly and good. I was able to order a chicken legs and mashed taters for one kid, coleslaw and frys for the other, other kids meals for the adults and no one complained. They are always more then happy to help you in anyway possible.
other I had been dying to try True Food Kitchen for a while now, after seeing reviews on it on various people's "Vegetarian" lists. I was even more psyched to see that it not only is close to where I live, but also took the place of that awful Coffee Plantation spot in the Biltmore! Yay!I went with my somewhat reluctant meat-eating boyfriend, but he was quickly won over with their expansive alcohol menu and their plethora of meat dishes- all either local or organic. A place we can both agree on!I ordered the honey lemonade ($3) which was the perfect balance between tart and sweet-- honey is a great sweetener! I was brought a refill just when my glass became less than half full-- bonus!We also ordered the hummus appetizer (~$8), which we both enjoyed immensely. My boyfriend liked the tart olives and feta cheese, whereas I loved the cucumbers! There was more hummus left over as our pita bread slices dwindled, but that just means we loaded up our pieces!For my main course, I had the TLT (Tempeh, Lettuce, and Tomato) ($9), which I really enjoyed. The tempeh was pretty crunchy, but it was balanced by the smooth avocado slices. The boyfriend ordered the Organic Ravioli with Ricotta cheese and kale pesto (~$13), which was super good! It came with 6 pieces of ravioli, which he thought was not enough at first, but after he cleaned his plate he said he was "stuffed." Good sign!! The plate also comes with a ton of meaty mushrooms, which made it even better in my opinion. We definitely did not have room for dessert, but I've heard mixed reviews of the desserts so I'm not sure if that's something we'll end up trying. Our server was extremely attentive to us, did not pressure us into ordering anything extra, and was prompt in refilling water glasses, answering questions, and bringing the check.The atmosphere is interesting- a mix of well-dressed business and retired people (think: khaki pants, button up shirts, sweater vests (in the winter); nurses just off work; people coming in for happy hour (jeans and nice shirts); and people just in off the street (shorts, casual shirts, even hats). I really liked this ambiance, because it doesn't make it too stuffy and turn people "off" of this locally grown, organic restaurant concept.We would definitely be back in a heartbeat, but the only reason I marked it down was because we were sitting underneath their funky lights, and a spider fell out of the light on to my boyfriend's arm. He wasn't terribly bothered by it (other than 'wtf, why is there a spider on my arm?') but I would have freaked out. So... don't sit under the lights, if you can help it!
other It's rare that I have a date with my husband on a Monday afternoon/evening, but this past Memorial Day, we did just that.  After a quick visit to the Science Center (the Van Gogh alive exhibit is a must-see by the way), we were hungry so we headed over to Rice Paper.  Neither of us had ever been before, and we were pleased with our experience.It was a tad bit too hot to sit outside, although they do have a covered patio with misters.  We walked in and were seated and greeted promptly by Al, our server.  He's quite the character.  He made us laugh quite a bit in addition to being attentive and making some recommendations.  We enjoyed the stylish renovated house / hip colorful atmosphere as well.We ended up ordering a few things and sharing.  Highlights included the firecracker shrimp. a spider roll, a shrimp roll, and a zen salad.  Everything was light and tasted fresh.  We really enjoyed the dipping sauces that came with the spring rolls.  They've got such a huge selection of the spring rolls, that I can't wait to return to try some of the others.  They don't have a huge selection of Vietnamese entrees, but it appears that they will custom create a bit upon request.I highly recommend going for the "food happy hour."  It's from 3pm - 6:30pm and includes $6 appetizers & $other off all spring rolls.  Such a deal!  We didn't take advantage of it, but the "drinks happy hour" is actually 11am - 6:30pm and specialty drinks are $6, house wine by the glass is $5, well drinks are $4, and draft beer is just $2.75.If only Rice Paper was a tad bit closer to home, I could see myself being a regular... Instead, I'll keep it high on my list of spots to return to when I find myself heading downtown!
other "Fuck you all, we hope you die.That's the Trojan Battle Cry!"Wow, I can not believe someone Yelp'ed PV.  My freshman year, my science teacher was arrested from embezzling from the strip joint she owned. We then had a different teacher every couple of weeks for the first half of the year. When we finally got a permanent teacher, the damage was done. The kids had no connection or respect for any teacher who walked in the door anymore.  The year I graduated, there were 3000 students and over 1000 in my graduating class. We often had 40+ kids in one classroom. Man, I hated this school. When I first started on the Bell Rd Campus, we referred to it as PV Prison because of the tall, iron, spiked gates and security in golf carts patrolling the campus for potential escapees. I remember, before they briefly closed the campus for renovations, a girl falling through the auditorium wall, and pieces of the ceiling falling on peoples heads before they condemned it. After other years at this location, they suddenly closed the campus and opened the new campus on Union Hills, the campus that was to become North Canyon. They built the new campus with the intention of having both schools open, but as more and more buildings kept falling apart, they decided to shut down PV and re-open it under the same name on the new campus.  They spent a shit-ton fuck load of money on a super high-tech theater, in return for letting it be used for official Gov't events,  that no one new how to use. This was one of the best things about it. I was one of the few people who could run the sound and lights and got out of class frequently because of it.  I remember making a video with Casey about an art show the school was having and not being allowed to air it on the morning video announcements because we used the phrase "come out of the closet" and they thought the phrase might be offensive. Then, that same week, the football team had a video where they all pretended to be gay, talking with lisps and flailing limp wrists. When I went to the office to ask what the fuck, they told me that football players didn't need approval for anything they did. I remember my friend being expelled for missing too much school due to chicken pox and a mother not well enough to call her in. I, of course, seemed invisible to the system. I ditched class often, and it never showed on my record at all. I remember when Miss Lee dressed as a hard rocker with tattoo's for halloween and the administrators making her change it because the costume was a bad influence. I remember my friends boyfriend being suspended because they searched his car for drugs (on an anonymous tip) and found a box cutter in his trunk he used for work which he kept in his trunk because he went to work straight from school.  I remember testing out of highschool classes before freshman year, yet being subjected to other years of bullshit. I am pretty sure it was PVUSD that was the inspiration for the movie "Pump Up the Volume", which was filmed in the general area.  When I quit the softball team, the coach/school councilor kept sending people to pull me out of class to try to talk me into playing again. When we took pictures for the badminton team, we didn't have enough uniforms for the entire team.  I felt like I was in some prison or some high security mental facility. In fact, when my mom visited the new campus, she was horrified there were no windows and they used the drab, grey/blue colors they use in mental hospitals she had worked in to keep the patients calm. I never had a chemistry class. My two history classes consisted of a teacher who spent one entire year talking about Shakespear, and another who said that "The slaves did not have it so bad".  My Biology book was so old, it had my friends mothers name in it from 20 years earlier, AND same friends mother warned me against my Biology teacher, Mr. H__. "If he ever tells you to stay after class by yourself.. DON'T."   The Good Things I Remember - Mrs. Toal [sp?], a very good, and supportive, English teacher. Miss Lee, the best photography/video teacher ever and always had the best Halloween costumes. Hanging out at lunch under a tree with the boy we called Rico Suave who said he lived in a box and would tell stories about the Horny Lady. Sneaking off campus to go to Barrows Pizza. My friends  wearing cut out Trojan condom boxes pinned to their shirt at the forced "spirit assemblies" and chanting our own spirit chant of "Fuck you all we hope you die, that's the Trojan battle cry". Time has a way of blurring the past, and making it less icky. Yet, my sister is a teacher at North Canyon, and a few years back I went and visited her on campus. The second I stepped into the main building, I felt sick to my stomach. Literally.  I hear they have made improvements since I graduated, and I hope so. I don't want my niece and nephew forced to survive another drone factory.
other I have confirmed the rumors that Big Wong will be closing before the end of the year. The owners have been locked in to a lease they assumed for the last 1other years and with the down-turning economy aren't able to continue.If you want a very reliable meal in a super friendly environment, rush on over before they close their doors forever.  : (
other My friends and I got a 10-person karaoke room and ordered food while we sang. The room is SMALL --in other K places I've been to, that would have been a room for other people. With 10 people in there, we turned into a sweaty airless mess very quickly. Secondly, their song choices are not good. They're behind about other years. Had we known, we would not have gone there. The food was mediocre; I've had better sushi. A room rental comes with a complimentary sushi platter, which was one roll (no idea what it was, even though i ate a piece); some edamame; two ribs. I ate the edamame; they weren't cooked through because they were hard and had that slightly spicy raw taste. We went on a Friday and it was packed to the gills with Scottsdale d-bags. At least the servers were very sweet, even though they messed up drink orders once and the bill once.
other Love spicy Mexican food? Well then this is the place for you. They have great food, great service and great beers to choose from. My family and I go here often.
other You may think this is a cop out... writing a review of Starbucks. It's like writing a review of water. ("It's wet, delicious and necessary to my survival!") My aim is simple here though. This particular Starbucks location is an excellent place for people watching. Try hanging out there between the hours of 11am and 1pm on a Friday afternoon and tell me you aren't entertained by some of the patrons who go in and out of the doors. While attending school, I was taking a screenwriting class and given the arduous task of writing descriptions of about 3other random people. Where did I go to write every single one of them? Park Central Starbucks. The crew here is also super friendly every time I come in and they do their best to remember my name. It doesn't help that I tell them a different name every time. OK that's not true, but what a fun social experiment that would make.The coffee... been there, done that and there's not much else I can say about it, but for the sport of people-watching, this a great place to hang out in the corner and just take it all in.
other Stopped into this good-sized place for lunch today, with Mike C.  It's a little worn, but comfortable, & I counted up 8other regular food items.  All that I tried from the soup, salad, sushi, hot dishes, & dessert selections were good, & I particularly enjoyed these items:*  The Hot & Sour Soup!*  The Kim Chi!*  A tasty salad topping with broccoli, mushrooms, & more!*  The Seafood Salad!*  The Egg Foo Young!A good solid 4-Star place here!  Lunch Buffet $6.99, $6.29 Sr.
other Friendly group. Great specials....Try THE BASIC breakfast. It's more than enough.
other Good clean Chili's. Friendly staff, although that can be a bad thing... since I have to tip them extra because they refill my cup every other minutes. I have been going a little bit more than usual because of the "other for $20" deal. Never had a bad experience here, just wish there was more on the 2-20 deal.
other These guys know their stuff.  Professional staff and great location.
other Just down Scottsdale Rd from the plastic, the cougars, the roid rage, and the Delta Bravos is a little place that doesn't give a shit, in the best possible way. In many ways, this is the dive bar Scottsdale doesn't deserve but needs oh so badly (and let's face it, being south of McDowell probably means you are not in Scottsdale by many people's account, which is just fine). To be clear, let's discuss some things a dive bar is...First, they serve drinks and beer. No basil martinis, No Sonoma pinot noir, and No craft double IPAs. Second, you do not come here to be seen or for a scene...see the first point for what you come here for. Third, the motif...none...unless you count a few characters at the bar. Now those are the basics, but Rogue Bar adds in great local and national acts, a diverse, non-Old Town crowd, and a friendly staff. For instance, I recently saw The Mulhollands, from LA, and I assure you, this band will soon be playing venues where you won't be getting up on stage with the band...not that anyone I know did such things. That is a great thing about RB, the lack of pretense carries throughout all aspects...even the DJ let me play with his DJ toys. Yes, yes, you don't want to model your toilet after theirs, the pool table is old, and you may see a fight. But, these are added flavor for a true dive bar. At the end of night you can say you had the chance to -- crash in some comfy booths, play some pool, order pizza for the bar, meet some real people, have a cheap drink, and if you are lucky, hang out with the band at an after party. If you like a dive bar, go. If you don't, stay up the road, nobody will miss you at Rogue.
3 Well it was off to Brio last night for "date" night!!!  The last time we were at Brio was in September to celebrate our 16th Anniversary...yes consecutive years, and it was a great evening!  Last night, no so much.  In all the years we've been going to Brio, we have NEVER had such HORRIBLE service....ever!The food was as amazing as it always is, but the terrible service completely overshadowed the tasty treats from the kitchen.  Our server stood and waited for us to finish sitting and before we could even open our napkins was asking for our drink order, not a good sign of things to come.  So I opted for water to come while we contemplated our cocktails.  So the water came, then nothing....nothing....no one....nada.  After about 10 minutes the server returned for our cocktail order.  The longest 10 minutes in history I'll admit.  So off to get the drinks....1other minutes later they arrived with the bread for the table...now mind you we'd been sitting alone at the table with no attention for 2other minutes now.  That is a lifetime for a restaurant that makes their money by turning tables.  When the drinks and bread arrived we opted to put in our dinner order, thinking we'd be in for a long bumpy night.  So we ordered, I ordered the Campanelle Carbonara, but with the Spicy Pepper Sauce from the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant Appetizer, as opposed to the traditional sauce.  The server said no problem, you want the Angel Hair Pasta with the Spicy Sauce, do you want to add Shrimp or Chicken???  Well the Campanelle Carbonara comes with Chicken, Spinach, Bacon, and Parmesan Cheese.  So I explained it is NOT Angel hair Pasta as the Campanelle is a 'trumpet' shaped pasta with curled edges.  He said "Oh you want the Lasagna Noodles".....!  Of course I just said ask the chef to prepare the entree as he usually would, BUT, substitute the sauces.  Glenn ordered the same, but with the traditional sauce.  We both opted for the wedge salad, and asked that our entrees not be fired until we were completed with our salad.  After all, we all know all the ingredients are pre-made, and just needed to be assembled and heated..  Whew...I felt...that was exhausting!  Then the salads arrived.  Ice cold, yummy...!  Now we are back on track.  Boy that salad does hit all the notes that take you back to your childhood.  Nothing is better than Ice Cold Iceberg Lettuce w/blue cheese dressing, bacon crumbles, and fresh shaved Parmesan cheese!!!  Then it happened.....yes just as we thought, in order to speed up the process that started so slowly............our entrees arrive BEFORE we were even 1/other way through our salads.  So there they sit...all beautiful, completed just as ordered...and no Lasagna Noodles, no Angel Hair Pasta...just the wonderfulness awaiting our forks.  But...yes...But, we'd not finished our salads.  By the time we did, our pasta was sad, cold, and looked like it had let us down.  It didn't, OUR SERVER DID....oh by the way were we EVER asked if we wanted anything else to drink???  You guessed it NO....were we EVER asked how our dinner was???  You guessed it NO... Now you're probably saying, 'why didn't you do something about it'?  We'd have loved to, but there was no one around...not even someone to fill our water glasses.  Only after we were finished with our sad, cold, entrees and had stacked all the dirty dishes in a pile on the edge of the table, did our server make an appearance to ask how our dinner is going??? Are you kidding me???  We just asked for the check.  Upon his return we presented him with the discount that Brio had sent us for being frequent diners, he took that and never returned.  After sitting there at an empty table, empty water glasses and nothing to look at but the crumbs left behind from the wonderful flat bread.  We placed cash on the table and left to try to reclaim our evening.  On the way out, Glenn finally spotted a manager and explained our evening and that it would be a VERY LONG time before we tried Brio again.  He, the manager, just stumbled over his words and said he wished he's known about our evening so he could have done something about it.  Well maybe if he'd been circulating on the floor as opposed to hanging out with the ever so cute hostess' he'd have known.  Do we still like Brio...YES...are we extremely disappointed with our service last night...YES.....
other Mmm. The cream cheese and potato soup always perks me up when I'm getting sick, and I love their chocolate chip scones! I've had their ravioli too, they're yummy. Wildflower is homey and consistent!
other I'm a loyal patron of Steve's Krazy Subs, so i don't want to get involved in a family rivalry.  However, sandwiches are my business and they deserve a fair critique regardless.  At first approach, Neds is much more of a professional looking sub shop.  Nice large dining area, clean, fancy tables (*more on those in a minute) I was glad to see that Neds had the same lunch special...8 in poorboy, chips and drink.$other more at Neds, but you get bigger chips.  Tasted exactly the same, so tough to compare.  My only complaint is the booths.  Probably great if you are 6'5, but for common folk, pretty uncomfy.
other When shopping is an adventure and a destination, you must be heading to Tan Phat. This is a funky Asian market that has been there for me whenever I need water chestnuts (for wrapping in bacon, and they carry five different brands! Who knew so many companies were in the business of the water chestnut?) or kitchen supplies for Asian themed dinners. One of the first things that hits you upon entering in the smell of seafood. After acclimating to that, you'll find a huge selection of canned goods, dried seafood and mushrooms, a decent selection of fresh produce and an ample amount of "novelty" edibles (you know, those intriguingly package foodstuffs that you just can't find outside of Asian markets). The employees are usually polite. You may have to walk through every aisle to find what you need, but that's part of the adventure.
other Cliff notes- Cheap: $1-2/plate- Fast: It's ready-to-go and on a conveyor- Acceptable quality: I'm here weekly and haven't gotten sick lolThis place is definitely good for what it is, "it" being a budget-friendly sushi place that's great for a quick bite.  In a response to the lower-rating reviews stating how the food is just okay at best or authentic or blah blah blah, well think of it like wal-mart vs. *inserthighendretailerhere*.  This place has a business model based on selling in large volumes (hence the low prices like wal-mart) so they're gonna have to "reduce costs" somehow (so-so quality food, not-so-attentive staff, and slightly smaller than average portions), but it's still a solid bang-for-your-buck kinda place.On top of this, I can be in and out quickly since everything is already prepared, perfect for those quick 30 min lunch breaks.  All that's required is for you to grab it off the conveyor (depending on whether or not all the items you want are on the conveyor at the time). I've never had issues with seating, but do not make a point to go during peak hours and usually go with a small party (2-other people).For those claiming to be "left to fend for themselves" due to an inattentive staff, most of your sushi-related inquiries can be answered by this thing called "the menu" that sits on the counters.  See, this miraculous piece of technology contains things referred to as "descriptions" on them that help to inform you about the sushi going round-and-round before you.  Furthermore, there's even a pricing guide based on the color code of the plates to assist you further! WOW! Lol wtf do people expect for $1-other plates of sushi?  Someone to hold your hand? LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL DIAFAnd the cherry on top? $other large japanese beers and $other sake bombs! HELL YEAH!
other Food is good.  Service is pretty good.Its a restaurant that definitely reminds you of LA, as it is very loud in there.Definitely will go back.
other took mom here for a visit on friday.  overall I like queen creek olive mill. I like that you can enjoy a meal or snack outside.  I like the stuffed olives and even though i didn't do the tour this time, i think that it is a great idea.  so, i have to say in general I'm a fan. with that said.... mom and I had lunch already but the food I did see did not look promising but we did enjoy two small gelatos ( $5.00).  I wish they offered some complimentary bread to sample the olive oils with.  Its a little difficult to find but very cute place to take your mom or friend or anyone who likes olive oil!
other They have anything from salads, pitas, wraps, burgers, and wood fired pizzas.  Although this isn't a 100% plant-based restaurant they pride themselves on having many vegan options.  Not only are there options, but upon visiting their site I found a table of what items are vegan, what aren't, and what makes them non-vegan (which is always nice to know). Great to have so many vegan options that are spelled out on their website.  We expected a counter-service experience but were pleasantly surprised when we entered to find it was an actual sit-down restaurant.  The vibe was a classy yet laid back, youthful feel.  Most of the servers were high school or college age and wore regular street clothes (think Urban Outfitters style).  I loved the laid back atmosphere of the servers even though it's a sit-down experience and really enjoyed the color scheme and tin plated ceiling.The food was absolutely FANTASTIC.  Oh my. For an appetizer we selected the garlic dip with two pitas.  The garlic dip is a mix of olive oil, lemon juice, fresh garlic, and smashed potatoes.  If you love garlic, you'll love this.My husband chose the Falafel Pita which was topped with cilantro and spices, mixed greens, tomatoes, onions, pickles and tahini.  He was very happy with his choice, although next time he'd ask for no onions.I went with the Veggie Garden Wrap that included zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower, eggplant, yellow squash, carrots, onions, tomatoes, brown rice, mixed beans, ginger, herbs and garlic.One thing we quickly found was that our entrees were HUGE.  This is not a complaint in anyway.  However, next go around we may share an entree.  Either way, this visit, we had leftovers to take home for lunch the next day. Will definitely return.
other I love Fez. I have been coming here for years. The food is always good and there is something for everyone on their menu. One negative: the service is mediocre. It can be quite hit or miss, and sometimes the servers are just plain slow. One suggestion: the menu could use an update. The dining options have been pretty much the same for years, and it would be fun to mix things up a little. One more thing, I have ordered take out for groups of about 20 before...the staff and chef were GREAT to work with and extremely accommodating. This is a nice asset on the Central corridor.
other Good water pressure.  $other = 6 min. Cons- "water pressure gun" rubber tips come OFF -can scratch car paint. Had to back out since a car blocked me forward-then a hose (which I put back) caught my car. Hispanc guy gets angry/curses. The ceiling 360 degress brush holder gets jammed. other is bent. Stalls get muddy.  Vacuums not strong.
other After driving by this place about a million times I finally remembered it when the old "Where shall we go to eat" question came up and I am now definitely a fan. I asked the server (Chico - he was great and seemed to really love working there) about his recommendations and tried the Salmon Spinach Enchilada which will be difficult to move on from when I go back. It was absolutely amazing and I tried my hardest to finish my plate. Only reason I did not give this place five stars is that the ambiance in the back room was a bit lacking. It was more cafeteria-styled and just not very warm and inviting.Regardless, I know that I will be back and definitely introduce this place to out of town guests!
other All I have to say is wow.  The auto picks and portrait pick that MelonFishPhoto did for me blew my mind.  I felt pretty confident after seeing some of the photos he had done, but my expectations were far exceeded.  He has a creative eye that caught much more than just the personality of the car.  The picture brought tons of people to my sites asking who shot the pics.  The portraits were truly great and fun to do.  I actually saw myself in a new light that I never saw before.  I loved it.  Anyone can take a picture, but very few people can take pictures that draw people in and seem to almost have an active emotion behind them.  I strongly recommend MelonFishPhoto to anyone for any photography need.
other These guys helped me out with my rear windshield wiper.  They could have just shrugged their shoulders and said they didn't have the part, but they worked with me and tried a couple of different options until we found a solution.  Everyone I encountered was great.
other The greatest community that I've ever been a part of!  Gilbert Crossfit isn't just a place where you can get in the best shape of your life... it is a community of friends that share the same outlook on life, support eachother in everything they do and truly care about one another.  Getting in shape and doing things you never thought possible is just the added benefit of being part of this group. If you are looking to get in shape, live a long healthy life, and have fun with a great group of people... come by Gilbert Crossfit.. You'll never go back to a Globo Gym again!
other One of the best lunches I've had in Phoenix.I'm still thinking about the fried egg sandwich and fries. A fried egg- yolk just barely runny. Barely. Two thick-ass slabs of good-ass, smoky-ass bacon. Arugula and aioli on a really tasty ass bun. Damn, son. Good as hell. The french fries were so damn good, too, and you have to dip those in the remoulade to really enjoy them all the way. I would come back for this sammich every day if I lived next door. Don't be afraid of it being called a fried egg sammich, because it's a whole nother level.
other If your going to see the Phoenix Coyotes at Jobing.com arena.....or the Arizona Cardinals at the University of Phoenix stadium....then you you can't really miss the experience that is the Westgate City Center. Now it is not a spectacular mall by any means...and the parking is a bit confusing...but it does have it's own flair and style. During the summer months it is the perfect place to go after a game or event at the stadiums...because you can grab some dinner....a drink...take a nice walk....or just hang out and watch the stars in the beautiful skies over Glendale Arizona.  The best part about all of this along with the close proximity to the stadiums.....is the parking is FREE....can't beat that. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!
other Best BBQ ever.  Go here and thank me later.
other Good food at a good price.
other Very consistent food. Definitely a second best to P.F. Chang's.
other Owner Daniel M. is one of my most favorite restaurateurs in Phoenix. His stamina and passion for the business of serving fine cuisine is a rare find. Daniel is from South America but you wouldn't know it; his knowledge of the secret kitchens of Tuscany, Umbria and Amalfi is uncanny. I know this because I traveled with him and his chef one year on their odyssey through Italy.Daniel takes special pride in personally choosing a very select few bottles of wine to fit any budget. OK, it's not Etienne's Different Point of View's list of 4000, but know that any choice you make is going to be a good one. If you're not sure, just ask for Daniel and tell him what you have in mind -- likely he has (with a wink) a special bottle in the back.When we traveled through the Italian countryside I was constantly astonished by the warm greetings and special invitations we had from local proprietors who shared with us exquisite homemade wines and dishes made with pride from the finest vegetables and livestock. We frequently stayed long past closing with the owners and into the night sampling rare port and grappa. At one restaurant in Orvieto the owner took us deep into the dank recesses of the wine cellar for a special sampling  of cheese and wine. Talk about knowing people? One afternoon while drinking our 5th bottle of wine, who walks by but Jan D'Atri! Wow. (That's another review.) And speaking of reviewers, I also ran into Phoenix Magazine's Nikki Buchanan (also extremely nice).When Daniel first opened in this location with that little stone oven in the corner, it was a pizzeria and guests could belly up to long tables in a casual environment that was made easy by his banter with the heavy Italian accented waitress (name?) who made a comeback some years later. For quite some time the restaurant was Il Forno; that is until corporate giant Il Fornaio entered the fray and sued him to change the name. After much rigmarole he changed to aqua e sale -- and notice Il Fornaio has since closed its doors? LOL. Again after much hoopla, he made it Daniel's. The current wood-paneled decor makes me think of a city club in San Fran or London. Very posh, yet understated. Selections of sculpture and art from his travels dot the restaurant's three small dining rooms.The menu is a very difficult one. I say that because it has all of your favorites and it is difficult to make your final selection. Great for steak, ravioli, the best carpaccio in the city, best buffala mozzarella, mmm.... I could go on and on. So does the menu, page after page.Some might call the preparations simplistic. This is the Tuscan way. Simple ingredients and simple preparation. Let the ingredients make their own magic. Grilled rack of lamb is not drowned in some Smucker's lime jelly, but gently brushed with rosemary and garlic, tickled with salt and pepper and finished with a squeeze spray of lemon.Unfortunately the artful one-of-a-kind plates and bowls handmade in Vietri chipped at the edges over the years and the health department made him throw them away -- UGH!! -- they were a beautiful motivation to make you lick your plate clean to see the painted pictures beneath your scrumptious dinner. Not that you needed an excuse to dab every last bit of sauce with the wonderful mini loaves of bread cooked right there in the hearth that started it all.Daniel himself is a wonderful host. He loves to give his guests a wonderful experience. There are many choices for Italian food in Phoenix. Most of it is just American Italian. Daniel's is a unique touch of the simple yet elegant. Enjoy.P.S. [post edit] OMG. How could I forget the Tiramisu? It's a generous portion, so you can share with your guest, but after your first bite you may not want to. Light and airy, yet fantastically flavorful, the quality of the coffee really makes this dish a reason to go back again and again. I'm not going to tell you the secret ingredient. You'll have to ask Daniel.
3 Bacon madness! Huge french toast! Cute little piggies decorating the orange walls!Oink is a friendly, peppy place to go for breakfast. The food is pretty good, the place is happy, all-in-all I would say this is the perfect place to wake up in the morning!The only irksome quality was our server, who seemed very nervous, checked on us at weird times, and said "you're welcome" too often (I didn't know that was possible, but it was). I enjoyed the jalapeno (!) bacon and the oink french toast. The cinnamon rolls were also tasty, but my group was disappointed by the eggs benedict. I would say the food could be better, but it's just awesome to have a local breakfast place somewhere in my neighborhood now!
other Went here for the first time today.  Loved it.  Becca was fun/professional and did a great job.I have been looking for a place to get a "big boy haircut" since I moved in the area a few months ago, so far Canyon Falls has impressed me. Normally I just settle for whats cheap and quick from an $1other haircut place. Yes, I paid more for my cut at Canyon Falls... but it was worth it.  The place is clean, the employees are clean, I was greeted right away when I came in and I left FEELING like I got a good cut.  I was only in for a cut/shampoo so I cant comment on any of the other services they offer but,  I think I might have found a my new place to get my hair cut...at last.  Thanks Becca.
other I've ordered pizza and wings three times and the have consistently created perfection, seriously.
other What can I say...Maharaja Palace was my midday getaway while living out in Phoenix, and I miss it dearly.  I visit as often as I can (up to three times a year, traveling from Hawaii) and when I do, I am always astounded by the flavors and array of choices this buffet provides.  The tiki marsala happens to be my favorite dish and I find the staff to be accomodating and attentive, especially when ensuring I've got enough na'an to sop up my plate's delightful curries.  I can't wait to return.  This is THE SPOT for Indian Food in the PHX Metro Area, hands down!
other This place would have gotten other stars for the food, but I deducted for the decor. In my humble opinion you have as close to authentic as your going to get. The place is close to being considered a "DIVE" but hey, you don't eat the building and furnishings. I like the fact they give generous portions and you can buy their home made tortillas and other items in quantities to take home and prepare it to fool your guests....did I say that out loud? LOL.... when I was in Nursing school (not far from there) I ate there a lot...gain a ton, but enjoyed every delicious minute of it!
other yeah, this is the place where pseudo sushi afficienandos go to feel like their really exotic food experts. if it's got cream cheese in it, it ain't sushi, and this place has cc is just about every roll.happy hour is LOUD in the bar. not fun loud, but "let's crank the bad early 90s alt rock and top 40 emo rock as loud as possible" seemingly as catch all for the only demographics who will like this place- early 20s and late 40s and 50s who want to seem like they still know how to get down with the younger generation.because it's ahwatukee (a "sleepy bedroom" community that is pretty affluent all in all and likes to be reminded), the crowd can be obnoxious, even more than this bar already is.again, i recommend it as a place to go and be rowdy, not to eat great sushi.
3 It serves the purpose.  That's about it.Raging Waters it is not. A smaller water park attached to a mini golf course it is.Slides are fun. Night splash is great--no sun, bearable temperatures and no sun burn. I definitely would never go during the day. I couldn't imagine standing in line for other hour+ with no shade, 110+ temps and broken misters (I didn't see a functioning mister in the entire park). Park could use a bit maintenance. Staff could use a bit of training.  Lines were very disorganized. Staff didn't have much of a clue as to what was going on. Ex:  spent our last 4other minutes waiting for the wave pool, getting into the wave pool and waiting about 15-20 minutes only for the wave pool to never come on and for the park to close.  Losing almost a full hour out of the other that night splash is open was a bit disappointing.I'd probably still return.  But only because there's nothing better in the valley.
other They do small engine repair here, so I took my lawn mower in.  It needed some attention -- a new carburetor, spark plug, bulb, and gasket.  Dropped it off in the morning and picked it up in the evening, very reasonable price.
other We arrived at 7:00, had a party of six, and were able to be seated within 1other minutes. Fabulous, considering the number of hungry people coming into the restaurant that evening, but we have always had good luck getting right into Grimaldi's, regardless of the location.The new Scottsdale Quarter location has great ambience and service going for it, but I was sorely disappointed by the quality of the pizza. One of the reasons my partner and I keep going back to the Old Town location is for the consistently tasty crust: crisp and thin, yet chewy and moist as well. Our pizza last night had a thicker crust and too well done, by comparison. Maybe the QC will improve as time goes on--I'm sure we'll be back to see.
other There is a Leinenkugel beer stand on the east side of the first floor heading toward Fatburger! SO so so excited to discover that! They only take cash though!
other Our waiter was Vincent. Very polite, helpful, accommodating, and knowledgeable about the menu and the taste of each item. Service was A+!  The food was fantastic. No errors, was tasteful, unique, and fresh! I will definitely come here again.
other Concept is great.  Stores are cool, but expensive.  Lunch was a bummer!  Ordered chicken salad sandwich and the tiny sandwich on a great roll with the tiniest amount of chicken salad was disappointing.  For that money I expected at least a regular sized sandwich.  Glad we tried it, but won't eat there again.
other I'm giving this place other stars because it just doesn't have it.  First off, the energy in this place is lacking.....the food isn't anything to write home about and seriously, I could of made better in my own kitchen.  The SPINACH CON QUESO DIP was ok, but the chips that came with it were stale and the CHICKEN AVOCADO SANDWICH was dry and came out like a burger not a sandwich......The Skinny Margarita's are horrible and lack tequila and the bartender doesn't know how to make a good martini to save his life!As for the staff?  Well our first waitress was a little too friendly and just about sat in my husbands lap....oh, I know that a little flirting comes with the job and is what you do to get a better tip, but come on honey, how did you know that I was not paying for that dinner?  If I was, the only tip you would of gotten would of been a 'back off a little on the whole, I have daddy issues in flirting'!  I have to admit though, once we changed seats after our dinner and went into the lounge area of the Bungalow, our waitress knew exactly what she was doing when it came to her job and her flirting was exceptional.....she knew how to work it while still being a classy lady, and I respect that! As for the clientele of this place, it's a younger crowd full of loud drunk guys at the bar watching the football game.  What you expect in a sports bar.....Outside the crowds quieter and more tolerable.All in all, I won't be back and I won't be recommending this place to any of my family or friends!
other Great at first, then the bartender ignored me and my friends for a good 20-30 minutes, put everyones bill on my tab. I opened a tab so this wouldn't happen then they made us wait another 1other for them just to ask us who had what. Then they over charged us by quit a bit. We had to flag someone f=down from napkins and plates and it took a few try's for a water. And to make matters worse my friend got a parking ticket because they took so long. There were three bartenders for what I handle myself at a bar on a daily basis. No sorry from any of them and not even a drip of regret from the manager. He pretty much told us to chill out after this whole 4other min waiting or deal, just to close a check. Kind of a joke really.
other My man took me to Fuego for a pre-birthday meal on a Wednesday night. I was surprised to see how many diners were there a. Because it's a Wednesday and b. Because it's in such an odd spot!! Once you get past the randomness of it's location, you will see how quaint and homey feeling it is. The two servers working the front of the house were friendly multi-taskers who welcomed, advised and fetched drinks while we decided on, then waited for our meal. We started with the scallop app and agreed that it was great, although small (3 scallops/$13). How bout one more tasty morsel? Apparently, it was small to save room for the hulking entrees we graciously received next! Wow! I had the seared ahi-a huge portion of it spicily seasoned, lightly seared, and great tasting! The man had the stuffed chicken breast, and inhaled it. It looked great as well. Also in the "great" category were the side dishes! Omg, the cheddar massed potatoes were so freaking scrumptious I could die! I also had the jalapeño creamed corn, that I mixed with the potatoes to make a combo from heaven! Man got the green chile cornbread casserole, which sounded meh, but tasted incredible! Such a fantastic meal! Stuffed with amazing food, and pampered by attentive servers, I was disappointed that I couldn't give Fuego other stars. But it wouldn't be prudent. Why, you ask? Because the sangria sucked. I had both the white, that tasted like watered down kool-aid, and the red, that tasted like old, cheap red wine mixed with coke a cola. They both sucked. Not good. Hopefully it was an off night, beverage-wise and I just happened to be there for it. Everything else was spot-on!
3 Stopped by to see what's new after the summer reopen.  New merchandising is really cool with the mixed textures with the textiles,  Some really great stuff and pretty good prices.  I've been in this store numerous times and though I like to be left alone to wander, when I do make - or try to make a purchase the owner and her staff are borderline rude.  There are many other great places where the staff is welcoming and anxious to help.  I've decided not to include this store on my regular rounds.
other Great bagels & bialeys!  Service was great, food was fresh, bagels & bialeys were like NY! I'll be a regular here! Also check for specials on Tues & Fridays
other INCREDIBLE food, relaxed/great atmosphere, perfect to bring kids/family...the cheeseburger, shredded bbq pork sandwich, sweet potatoes- too die for! Must try! Worth the drive!
other Good place to meet a group, watch a game or grab a quick bite. We found this place on St. Patrick's Day after a long, frustrating day of apartment searching. No wait, quick/good/friendly service, good food and lots of good beer. I like the segmented areas and because it is so big, even when there is a huge crowd, you never feel like you have lost your personal space. Have walked over many times since and will definitely continue to.
other Did you know that Malee's on Main offers cooking classes!?  They offer them twice a month during tourist season and once per month during the rest of the year.  I attended two weeks ago, and it was OUTSTANDING!  Not only did we learn to cook Thai (which, incidentally, it was significant to learn that Thai gets its flavor by layering is sauces), but we were given the recipes for some of the signature dishes, served tastings, a meal, and wine pairings, and we were even given goody bags.  It was a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon with another foodie!
other Where else can you get fresh lemon grass, fresh pork uterus, and avocado ice cream?  Asian markets are the bomb, but Lee Lee's is the BOMB DIGGETY since they have EVERYTHING.  Jamaican, Cuban, Vietnamese, Korean, Indian, Lebanese---you name it.If you love to cook (and I do, I really do!) you can seriously spend hours here.  ONE CAVEAT:  The seafood is fresher and better at 99 Ranch on 44th St. in Phoenix.Last week, they were giving a 10% discount off of your grocery bill and a free bottle of fish sauce or soy sauce.  If you spent over a certain amount, you got a big bag of rice.Go!  Now!And have lunch in the Vietnamese restaurant attached.
other Don't be confused by the Yelp definition, "Yay, I'm a fan",  Lowes gets other stars because they have great employees that get me out of there fast!  I'm not one that would typically be classified as "Handy", so the fact that I can go into Lowe's, and get someone to give me DIY instructions in about other minutes, makes me happy.  I've been to several Lowe's/Home Depot's in the past, but I feel compelled to review this location, because after 10+ trips (mostly on the weekends), I have never had to wait for assistance or behind more than one customer in line.  Also, they get bonus points for not only allowing my pups in the building, but complementing them on their cuteness =).
other no chip manicure: no drilling, no filing, no damage, no dry time! we offer over 100 colors form opi , shellac, gelish, Experienced Tech, Professional service and Satisfaction guaranteed.
other Mojo's was my favorite till I tried Menchies..much better flavors like Chocolate Covered Banana and even Pumpkin (awesome) for their seasonal!  Lots of flavor, very rich, clean & priced at about what they charge at mojos..maybe a little more but Im not sure!
other Best place around for sweet and sour chicken! The kids meals rock as they come with fried rice, a choice of meat and beef skewers. Did I mention their only 5-6 bucks? Little outdoor seating patio. The only thing we've found on the menu none of my family likes it the egg rolls.  Good prices and food.
other As far as indie record stores, this is truly as good as it gets in the valley.It is a breath of fresh air because it is a REAL record store, and you can sample CD's along the wall to get your music fix.I love how they have a list of recommended new releases. I definitely refer to them if my music is getting stale.Recently, my husband and I have bought albums from Beirut, Andrew Bird and Iron & Wine. They have everything your heart desires- so go and get you some!OH- and I just found out you can buy concert tickets there, and they usually give out a free "Magnet" magazine with each purchase. Woohoo!
other I have a serious Banana Republic problem. Rewind time to about three years ago when I bought my first dress from BR. I had just gotten my first full time "real job" after finishing college and I needed a wardrobe to match my new position. It is now three years later and I have probably close to twenty dresses from BR. The only issue I have is they leave me pretty darn broke, so when I heard BR had a factory store I was stoked! So last weekend I dragged my husband, sister and niece down to Anthem to check this place out.It was crowded, but the prices of the items definitely make up for it. That is, when you find something worth buying. The selection of items is a little weird, and you have to fight with many other women to get into the racks with the good stuff. But I managed to find two 100% cotton dresses that are both casual and work appropriate at the same time. Priced originally at $80 with a markdown to $40 on the rack, they also had a 25% off sale on these particular items that day. So I scored two dresses originally totaled for $160 for $60. Sounds like a good deal to me. I wish they had more colors, except that would have been bad for my credit card cause I am sure I would have ended up buying them all. My husband also scored two pairs of jeans, two cotton shirts, and three pairs of boxers for under $100. I can see myself making the 50 minute drive down here at least four times a year to see what new stuff comes in. My dress collection is going to get larger this year, I can tell you that. Also, if you sign up online for the factory store you can get coupons for extra % off your total purchase. So your super discounted items just got even more discounted.
other The pizza is incredible, they use really high quality ingredients and the prices are great. I would recommend cooking it on the bottom rack of your oven for a slightly better texture on the crust.I want someone to mark that this post is funny, so I will add a joke:Mushroom walks into a bar... Bartender says, "sorry, we don't serve your type here." Mushroom says "why not? I'm a fungi (fun guy)."
other The first couple of times I ate here I wasn't sure why people were always so crazy for this place. It's been about two years since my last visit and in the past couple of months I've already been here like three times and wanted to go back more. I've decided that it's all about what you order; for example the first time I went I probably felt overwhelmed with all the choices and decided to go for something really plain like turkey with hardly any toppings, have fun! Their menu has a wide variety of yummy sandwiches and lots of new tastes to try. Also, don't be afraid to speak up. I was a little disappointed by the lack of lettuce and veggies on one of my veggie sandwiches but I also didn't pay attention. Now I ask for lots of lettuce and they're happy to make it the way I like. They make their breads fresh and they have garlic-herb bread that has lots of flavor. I won't order a sandwich from there without a side of ranch dressing. I am a picky ranch eater...I hate mayonnaise so I am always super careful that ranch doesn't taste or resemble mayo. I usually like restaurant mayo that is a little more runny in consistency with lots of flavor. They have the best home made ranch dressing here! Pair it with the garlic-herb bread and your sandwich is going to be booming in flavor. OMG! Wipe...sorry I just started to drool a bit. Service is good...everyone runs at the same chill pace which seems to go well with the theme of this restaurant. My current favorite is the Humboldt sandwich...I get the Pinner (8") but I swear some days I am so hungry I think I'm going to order the Blunt (12")...maybe someday soon. All sandwiches get toasted. Okay so toppings: Guacamole, sprouts, lettuce/spring mix, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, black olives (I get mine w/o), cucumbers, pickles, your choice of cheese (I get Swiss), with their house goodies (EVOO, vinegar, herb mixture on top). Now that I found my sandwich, I crave it all the time and can't wait for my next visit. Oh, be sure to check their daily specials too! If you're lucky enough to be in their delivery area...well, darn you then! :-)
other This is my favorite spa in the world! Hopefully, I'll make it to others...but if I could only get to the Camelback Inn, I'd be in heaven. Here's the rundown of how I enjoy the place: Early morning appointment for massage - Rose does fantastic hot stone - I like her the best. Then I shower and get into the eucalyptus steam room. Next I head out to the pool and savor the view of Camelback Mountain and the amazing desert landscaping they've procured. I drink some water and as I lounge there, I order a small, healthy and very tasty meal (usually breakfast). I swim a little, lounge a lot - regardless of the time of year.  If I have planned it, I then head back into the showers and clean up for my next treatment. I spend hours there and if I feel like I might be pressed for time, I reschedule.
other Food is great.  Best Thai in West Valley.  Always get takeout so not sure about the service, but takeout is always ready when they say it will be ready.  The atmosphere is quiet and cozy - about a dozen to fifteen tables or so.  Place always seems clean when I pick my food up and has the type of decor you'd expect to see in a Thai restaurant.  I usually get red chicken or beef curry hot, and my wife gets green curry mild.  The food is excellent.  Their egg rolls aren't very greasy like most places.  Spring rolls are also made fresh to order with fresh veggies.  The only thing is, sometimes the spiciness of the curry will be spicier some days and not as spicy others.  Other than that, this place is great.
other Being from NJ I am always on the prowl for my hometown pizza and Italian food. They have absolutely the best cannolis like my grandmothers!  The pizza droops like Ray's Pizza in NY. I'm not a big fan of sauce that has any sugar in it which most do so to many their sauce is awesome. I prefer unsweetened everything.The service is great and they are from New Jersey!  It's a great place to grab their special other slices and a coke for $4! YUM!
3 The food...delicious. The atmosphere...relaxing. The service...pretty spot-on. The pricing...ehhh, not my thing here. The only way I was able to eat here was because a family friend treated my family out. But if you're looking to spoil yourself or anyone you know, with food, this is the place to do it. I ordered the Chicken Romano (pan-seared with a blend of romano cheese & panko breadcrumbs, with lemon shallot butter, tomatoes, asparagus & yukon gold mashed potatoes). The chicken pan-seared with bread crumbs was great to eat, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.The asparagus... I've had better, but the yukon gold mashed potatoes were silky, buttery and made perfectly. They went well with the chicken romano.My dad ordered the NY Strip, and they were kind of enough to cut it up for him since he was handicapped. They checked up on us frequently. THE ONLY THING I WOULD COMPLAIN ABOUT WAS THEY ACTUALLY CAME UP AND ASKED IF I WAS DONE (ALREADY GRABBING AT MY PLATE) WHEN THE FORK WAS STILL IN MY MOUTH BECAUSE APPARENTLY I WAS STILL EATING. Since that ruined my entire experience thus far, I just told them to take it.In addition, the entire table got an order of the unlimited salad bar. The salad bar was great, but nothing like the choices offered at Souplantation. Also, because I ate the salad beforehand, I wasn't able to finish off the main entree I ordered. Will I be back? Probably not.
other In my opinion, this is one of the best restaurants on and/or near Baseline Rd in Tempe.Their service is great! You will be greeted from the time that you step a foot through their door. Unfortunately, per today's so-called standards this is not a very common courtesy. If you a first time customer or a returning customer, you can ask the person behind a counter to recommend a meal for you or you can ask for a minute or five. As a very indecisive person when it comes to choosing an item from a menu... I really, REALLY appreciate it when I do not feel rushed when it comes to making such an important decision in my overwhelmed life. :PI haven't tried too many things from their menu because I usually stick to my favorite: Award Winning Gyro Lunch/ Dinner. A plate of delicious slices of beef and lamb, carved off the rotisserie, served with fresh toasted pita.Lunch is served with your choice of the sides... Oh, and did I mentioned that their prices are extremely affordable! $5-$13 price range!!So, enjoy your meal and make sure that you do get a chance to turn around as you are walking out because they WILL thank you for coming!Kudos to you... my dear My Big Fat Greek Express owners and employees for making my oh-so-many dining experiences pleasant! I shall forever cherish thee!!
other Food was alright, nothing special, a bit bland. The water tasted so bad though, bad enough that you could still taste it through iced tea or tap water, do they not have a filter!?
other I split the veggie platter with a friend and we only got just over half way through it.  Got the rest to go.  I couldn't wait until I had room to eat again so I could eat the leftovers.  Sooo much good stuff.  I'm usually not a glutton, but there are a precious few places where I lose all self control and beach myself and this is apparently one of them.We were there for an hour and half and asked all sorts of questions about how things were made and what they were.  The lady that waited on us may have been the owner.  She was cheerful and happily indulged our questions.It's a large restaurant with plenty of seating for large groups, but it also seems to be an authentic family outfit.  They have a few beers in bottles and apparently authentic music.I'm sad that I'm moving out of this neighborhood right as this moved in!  If I weren't leaving, I'd probably give up cooking entirely and just eat here every day, or try to get take-out.If you're downtown or on the east side of Phoenix, it's worth the trip.  Really good ethnic places outside of the Italian/Chinese/Mexican/American mold are a treasure here in Phoenix.  If you're from somewhere more metropolitan, you know what I'm talking about.   West Bring friends, dates, clients, and employees here and impress them.
other Food is yummy!!!! I have never been to a other Guys, so I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered a burger, unaware that it is actually a double burger, which was HUGE! Hubby and I shared a large fry. We could have easily split a burger and a small fry. Love that fact that "everything" includes grilled mushrooms and onions. So much food. This location was messy. I am not sure of the peanuts are a great idea because there are shells and dust everywhere.
other Go from brunch and get the breakfast nachos. OMG. They were to die for. red chile sauce, two cheeses, baked chips, chorizo eggs. Got sour cream on the side and left of the pico. Came with sausage gravy that was not the artery cloggin' kind. These were so yummy.It was a little dark inside (full out front) and they don't have sweet & low. Nice ambience. Totally cool for the kids, too, but no paper kids menu.
other After reading the great reviews and getting plenty of recommendations to try Fez, I had the awesome opportunity to test it out last night at my first Yelp event and I am in love!  From the bright decor to the delicious food to the amazing service (I mean everyone who works there actually looks like they enjoy their job and are having a good time!) this place is other star.  I love the cozy lounge feel and could easily see myself enjoying several hours of delicious cocktails and conversation with friends.  This would be a great spot for dinner, drinks, or even an event (another Yelp event please!).Highlights:Tasty drink menuFabulous wicker tables and trendy IKEAish styleGreat part of townSexy servers...dangImpress someone: Take them to FEZ!
other had the place to ourselves on a thurs nite (5/19) so...service great, mgr came over and asked if we had eaten here before "nope" so he said he wanted to buy dessert, "great, thank you" oreo cheesecake was good... now.... pizza...pricey by 2-other bucks but was very good. can't go wrong with your toppings but the riccotta was not my cup of tea (wife liked it on her pizza). definetly going back to try it again... great crust
3 Solid. We hit up the happy hour which features 50% off booze and tacos for $1.50. I had the duck, shrimp, and cochinita pibil (pork). They were tinier than most street-style tacos I've had (and boy howdy, have I eaten a lot of those from Cali to NY) and  even a little soggy. The duck was my least favorite as it had a rubbery taste and texture. The shrimp was A-OK but for my money, the cochinita was really where it's at with his super-porkey deliciousness. We also split the queso fundido (rich with cream cheesey chunks, whaaaat???). It was way tasty but it could probably double for spackle in a pinch. The most successful item of the night was the churros with goat cheese caramel. Between my 3 buddies and myself, we made quick work of that dish. Each of us had their house margarita which was strong (just like I like it), but I'm not entirely sure I'd order that drink for non-happy hour prices. One of the big drawbacks, however, was that our server was really rushed and we had a hard time getting his attention. On the whole, I think I'd be back to try some other items. The chicken mole torta looked really appealing. Be forewarned though, it IS a spendy joint. Expect to pay $1other - $20 for most entrees. On a post-grad shoestring budget, it is certainly a splurge. We did love the mural outback and the groovy art inside.
other My house has never been this clean EVER!!! I am thrilled with the level of service and professionalism expressed by the women who cleaned my house today! I bought a Living Social coupon, and I am so glad I found this company. other women arrived and fully cleaned my house in 4other minutes. The women were friendly to me and especially my dog, which is the sign of a wonderful company, if you ask me. I am hoping I am able to use this service on a monthly basis. Angela scheduled my appointment immediately when I let her know I had company coming in town, and the cleaners arrived during the scheduled time. I am thrilled with the results!
other Way overpriced. Wide selection. Good to browse, not to buy. Check out your local mexican market.
other I can dig!  Food here is very good.  I believe everything here is made from scratch the soup to the sauce cause they taste wonderful.  I go for lunch every now and then and I've seen this place slowly pickup business.  It has that deli-sport restaurant feel, but the food brings it home.  I appreciate the usage of real plates instead of paper or styrofoam plates -- very environmental friendly!  I would definitely recommend this place for lunch - 1/other sand, their pastafagioli soup = Yum! & drink.
other I found some great t-shirts for friends here, including one from a local PHX artist with a grinning skull.  If you're a hipster or looking to buy gifts for one, then this is the place to go. Plus, the clerk was using a Mac (not that I would expect anything different, but bonus verisimilitude points for fitting in with your surroundings Mr. Clerk).
other Funny how progress sometimes catches you off guard!  My local Fry's is going through a revamp and now I have no idea where anything is. It's just momentary inconvenience- I will find my bearings again and appreciate the improvements!
other Stayed here on Feb 10/11/1other was over all good experience.Was judging horse show, so, hours a bit strange.  Desk staff very polite & helpful.  Due to injury, used small suite w/disabled capacity  $10 more.  Very comfortable, good bed/pillows/amenities.  Clock radio wouldn't allow wake up.  Lots of TV channels.  Following afternoon, was shy coffee, shampoo, soap, etc., went to desk & resolved(housekeeping problem).Breakfast was OK on first day-not really different than most good hotels.  Second day, Biscuits & gravy good.  Lady taking care of breakfast room OUTSTANDING.  If this hotel wants to host horse show folks, they might consider animals, and taking a security deposit.  As a judge, I do not bring animals.  In normal travel I do.Would certainly come here again.
other Pleasant restaurant with a variety of rooms. Farm fresh food is always better than frozen. Great place to relax and talk with your table mate.
other NO BETTER BREAKFAST IN AZ. From scrambled eggs to their blueberry pancakes. Top end. Yes, you pay for it. But it's special, like Valentines Day. Just pay out and enjoy the treat. Lunch is also nice, especially if you get a seat outside so you can people watch. Great wraps and sandwiches. Haven't tried anything later here yet. But I saw their happy hour specials and it is on my TO DO list.
other In one word...excellent!  My fiancee and I had an amazing time here last summer, when we were upgraded to a Spa Casita Suite because the hotel had found out about our engagement, which happened right before we left for our trip.  The room was huge, the grounds were beautiful, the pool was awesome, and everything there was so peaceful.  The concierge helped us with directions to anywhere we wanted to go and the location was great as well...not far from the main drag, but somewhat hidden from the outside world.  We are hoping to return soon.
other Excuse me. How in the world have I lived walking distance from Cornish Pasty Company for over a month and have only barely heard of this gem?! Thats what I want to know.A friend introduced us to Cornish Pasty saying it is "the best restaurant ever". I best give it a try then right? The Tempe location is smaller than the Mesa location but I LOVE its vibe. A small narrow walking space between people sitting at a counter behind the kitchen and people sitting at teeny tiny tables, dim lit lighting and candles and for the most part, pretty good music. My man and I ordered the Mexican Pasty and the Rosemary Chicken Pasty. They were unbelievable! SO GOOD. The Mexican Pasty was definitely the better of the two but I'd order both of them again any day. A little heavy dinner action to make a girl feel full and happy. I respect restaurants that have a plethora of vegetarian options. What generation are you living in if you don't offer veggie options these days? Get with the program all you other restaurants. You know who you are! I loved the entire experience and can't wait for our next trip.
other "Fine dining" is not just a setting.  it isn't just good food.  It is many things that add up to an attitude. I have had the opportunity to find it in different cities. I found it the other night at the Stockyards.We were seated by a host who took us to our table and when we were properly seated gave us menus.  Our server came to the table and introduced herself and said she would return shortly.  It was nice to have a moment to chat before we had to think about ordering.  When she did return,  our glasses were filled-not something we should have  to wait for her to do when the service is right.  She knew the selections on the menu and all available options and could make sensible comments concerning them.  Our salads were served promptly by two additional people and were as fresh as I could ask for.  When my friend was finished with hers they asked if they could take her plate.  I was pleased when they didn't ask me if I was finished with my salad and could they take my plate.  If I'd been finished I could have told them.  We were able to continue our conversation uninterrupted as I finished my salad.  The salad plate was removed  when it was appropriate and we had a few minutes before the entrees were served.  All was in keeping with a relaxed dining.  At no time did I have to think about having drinks refilled, it just happened quietly.After a few minutes our dinners were served by the two gentlemen and our server appeared to make sure they were to our satisfaction before we started.  There was no room for error there that couldn't be resolved before we started.  My friend had ordered a small steak. My friend is  quite elderly and Kathy, our server, discretely asked her if she'd like it cut for her.  A potato also was served with her dish.  I asked my friend which of the condiments she would like it prepared with.  She look at me and said "Prepared with?" She didn't understand what I was getting at but Kathy did and was already reaching for the potato.   She opened the potato and smiled while my friend said a bit of everything.  One doesn't go to a restaurant like the stockyards to have to deal with opening a hot potato and preparing it.   When serving is done properly, these things don't have to be discussed.  Kudos to, Kathy!!!.  That is part of the fine dining experience.I had a full rack of ribs which were so tender the meat fell of them.  The sauce had spice to it but not so strong the flavor of the meat was concealed.  I also can tell you that unless you are a big eater, half a rack would fill most people.  My friend said, "Yummy!"  and I agreed.  I am used to getting a finger bowl for clean up after eating, but I can't complain about the two extra napkins and several ways of cleaning my fingers that accompanied my ribs.  My friend let them know we were celebrating the 17th anniversary of my 39th birthday so they served me a free desert.  I can assure you the pecan pie is a delight!  Warm and laced with brandy, it was perfect way to finish our dinner.The stockyards, I might mention, is not inexpensive, but what an enjoyable way to spend your money. They do offer two dinner specials you won't find at most other places.  They do have a luncheon menu that has lower prices.   Don't expect chrome and music that is a bit to loud as many of the new places offer.  Instead, just enjoy a time and place where they pamper you as you should be when you go to the Stockyards.I don't consider the stockyards to be a place you where shorts and Nike's, but of course there are always a few.  I would say a nice shirt and slacks at least.
other The people at this title company are as good as it gets.They are eager to do a really good job for the agents that usethem.  Bill Risser and Paul Guenther are techno pros regardingthe Social Media techniques and readily share their expertiseand time to teach the skills of Twitter, Facebook, Hootsuite, and other aspects of Social Media which agents can utilize to serve their clients in a diligent and efficacious manner.  The buyers and sellers of  property will really gain by using them because their handling of the transaction will be efficiently and quickly finished.
other What can I say - I love this place!  I was introduced to it by a group of 20 something friends so I was a bit worried going there (I'm no longer of that age group.)  Turns out I had nothing to fear!  Roosevelt is perfect for a glass of wine with the hubby or post dinner cocktails with a group of friends.  Still have a the munchies after dinner - there is a great food menu selection as well.
other I've been going to La Canasta for as long as I can recall. I live in Tempe and can't go as often as I'd  like but I go at least once a month. I love this Canasta because they have a green chile salsa and menudo every day! Always quick and fresh. I either get the ground beef tacos (yummy), the red chile burrito (watch out), or the menudo (got a hangover?). It is very consistent and prices, well it adds up, but it is worth it. I have yet to have a bad experience after 28 years!
other The consummate beer bar.  Great selection, knowledgeable bartenders and eclectic patrons.  What more can you want from a drinking establishment?  The food is good too.
other One of my fave spots when I'm hitting up the late night in Scottsdale. And yes, the Old Town location is SO much better than the one in North Scottsdale. Get there early for 2-for-other martinis - they have a ton to choose from, if you're a frilly martini drinker - but also make a mean dirty martini with olives, which is my own personal indulgence. Multiple rooms for multiple scenes - a dance floor, a more chill bar room and an outdoor loungey space - so whatever you're looking for you can find it here. Just make sure you've got cab cash to get home - three of these martinis can definitely get the best of you!
other Treachery! Seek it out:Let me begin this review by saying that mine is not an indictment on this particular location but on every single P.F. Chang's I've had the misfortune of being dragged to.P.F. Chang's is effectively the Cheesecake Factory of bad Chinese food, with the disadvantage of not being as capable of delivering passable food. They bill themselves as a "gourmet" Asian experience, which is a bit of a laugh when they turn around and sell you their equally horrible frozen entrées right from the convenience of your local Wal-Mart. Everything is bland, overcooked, and ridiculously priced. Once you've paid nearly $1other for their "orange peel chicken", you may privately hope to yourself that they might have the audacity to include some fried rice. This is your second mistake. Sadly, the bistro calls you on your bullshit. You get white or brown--fried rice is several dollars extra and not at all worth it.Everything seems to be cooked just wrong--things that shouldn't be are too crispy, things that should be sauced are too dry, things that should taste good make you question the will of the gods, all the while you find there's no way to escape the treachery.Things get more and more frustrating as you dig deeper: P.F. Changs, while sounding vaguely Asian, is a wholly American creation. It was founded by Paul Fleming (in Scottsdale, actually) with SOMEone with some Asian influence to spice it up a bit, named Philip Chiang. (They literally cut out the poor bastard's "i" so that it would "fit on the signs better," or, as I like to believe, not scare away the flyover-states-white-folk so.) It's highly Americanized (and yes, I've had Chinese food in China, but I've also enjoyed great "American Chinese" food here) to the point of regrettable blandness and it is SO VERY EXPENSIVE you may find your credit score taking a ding after eating a plate of "wok charred beef", listed as one of the saltiest foods in America.The decoration is clumsy and their famous inclusion of terra cotta warriors are literally symbols of death. From Jennifer 8 Lee's Fortune Cookie Chronicles:'But not everyone finds the terra-cotta warriors charming. "Chinese people would never put that in a restuarant," Jim told me, pointing at the statues. "It's not lucky. It's something you put at a burial site! But in America, they think it's a Chinese thing." From a Chinese perspective, P.F. Changs is decorated with death.'Which is just fine, because everything there tastes like death anyway.
3 PPP was decent. The white chocolate beer was delicious. I will be back for some more of that. I cannot wait to go back for happy hour. Steak is steak to me. It was not out of this world, but it was good. The sides were fair, beans and bread. The beans lacked flavor, but I might just be biased, my dad makes a mean pot of cowboy beans. The whole restaurant is very kitschy. Everything revolves around the cowboy theme. This place would be great to take tourists. -other for undercooked steak -other for tasteless beans
other i have other words for you: passive. active. dividing the dog park into sections based on tempermant isn't smart, it's f'n brilliant. other gates upon entrance and exit safe it up so i have no worries that my shelter dog will hit the streets again. this dog park is clean, the people are friendly and so are the dogs. finally, a place where we can all get along.
other Walked in during late lunch hour. Did not get acknowledged for about other mins. When I finally got sat down, and served my salad, I found a hair in it. Got no apology. Just a sigh firm the waitress when she took it away. You can't pay me to go back here. The waiters are rude.
other This is seriously one of my favorite restaurants of all time. I've been many times and it's always fabulous. I LOVE their Mahi Mahi Tacos - they are so good! I also highly recommend the Pork Osco Bucco, Smoked Red Chile Pork Roast, and the Cowboy Beef Stew. The nightly specials are often very creative and delicious. This place is also good for Sunday brunch. Good bartender too - drinks are never too weak.
other Over-priced, over-crowded and every time I have been there...it has confirmed that they pour the worst martini!But if you are looking to 'people watch' this is the place - the interior permits a great open ambiance  with an open area overlooking the bar. I think the exhaust-system isnt strong enough for the Teppan tables because I smell like heavy fried food when I leave!!
other "So Jimmy, tell the class what you saw at Sweeties!""OK, well, I saw lots of candy. Old-timey candy and cool candy and neat candy. Lots of it. Real lots.""And I saw people walking around with baskets and talking about candy. And talking about candy when they were little.  And talking about what candy they should get for their kids.""Oh, and I saw Turkish Taffy, Maple Bun Bars, Fruit Stripe Gum, Moon Pies, Cherry Mash, Mary Janes, Valomilk Candy Bars,Sen Sen Packs, Goo Goo Clusters, Squirrel Nut Zippers, Flipstick Lipstick, Licorice Pipes, Zero Bars, Twin Bings, Look Bars, Abba-Zabba Bars and U-No Bars.  And that was only a little of it.  And lots of other stuff.""Teach?""Yes Jimmy?""The coolest teacher ever would take her class to Sweeties.""Would they?""Yes."
other I've been here a few times with my mom because she really likes it, but overall I wasn't impressed.  The food was tasty, but the service was atrocious.It was busy the last time we went, but we stood around inside the door for probably 10 minutes before an employee even noticed us.  There were other parties waiting, too.  You just had to stand around and wait for someone to bother seating you in one of the open booths.Everyone was satisfied with their meal.  I've had the spinach tacos, which were very tasty, and I appreciate having a veggie option that wasn't a run-of-the-mill bean and cheese or chile relleno.  (I've had their chile relleno and wasn't impressed by it.)  But no one refilled our drinks the whole time or checked on us.  Not even once. Maybe this is better when you go at a less busy time, but the food isn't mindblowing enough to make it worth the lousy service on a Friday night.
other Delish!!!!!! x 100!!Love, love, love this place. This is the place that made me a Vietnamese fan for sure. My friend brought me here and I was blown away but the tastiness of their food. Their spring rolls are so yummy! The chicken noodle soup flavor is a winner in my book! Everything on the menu is delicious, though I haven't tried is all, I'm sure it is!
other Love this place. Actually, today was awesome, because they usually only offer the "express dozen" through the drive thru, and the kids didn't want to go in, so the dude behind the speaker actually fulfilled my order as I wanted.The only thing that bugs the hell out of me is that they charge for other donuts when you get a long john. :-(
3 Wow, what a blast from the past!  I hadn't eaten at a Sizzler since it was popular in '80s, so when we saw that they opened up again where Taco Tote used to be, we had to go and check it out!When we walked in, it was like reliving my childhood, when we went to Sizzler as a special dinner, to gorge on the salad buffet and the unlimited fried shrimp.  Seeing that the salad bar itself was $8.99, and that for only a dollar more I could get a half dozen of fried shrimp, I figured I might as well!  The shrimp comes with your choice of side: either some incarnation of potato (fries, baked, etc.) or veggie (Such as steamed broccoli).  The shrimp looked just how they did in the '80s, pounded then battered and fried.  They were decent, nothing too special, but not bad.The salad bar has various salad greens, toppings, and dressings to choose from.  There's also an area with cold shrimp and halved avocados.  I was excited to see that they had such high quality items, but unfortunately the execution was something left to be desired.  The shrimp was deheaded, but whole, so if you wanted de-veined shrimp you had to de-vein them on your own.  The shrimp was also overcooked, and a bit tough as a result.  The avocado was a nice touch, but unfortunately many of them were slightly under ripe, so they tasted a little sponge-like rather than creamy.The hot foods section along the corner area of the buffet has items such as buffalo wings, meatballs in marinara sauce, and a taco bar.  There are also desserts here, like brownies, bread pudding, and soft serve ice cream with various toppings to choose from.  The taco bar was probably the best part of the hot bar.  There are various outer shells to choose from (Tostada, hard taco shell, soft tortilla, taco salad bowls), other meats (Ground beef and carnitas), and veggies (Such as pico de gallo, jalapenos, guacamole, cheese, lettuce).  There's also gooey nacho cheese and refried beans at the counter.  The carnitas was probably the best out of all the taco toppings.  It was slow cooked, and had a rich, deep smoky flavor.  Service was good, drinks were refilled and dirty plates were removed as needed.  One thing to note is that you cannot add tip to your receipt since you pay for your meal first, and then sit down, so cash will help for tipping your waiter!
other I really enjoy That's A Wrap... all of the food I've ordered here has been really enjoyable, plus it's all a really good value for the money. My favorite wrap here is the Prince of Thai, sin pollo con tofu. The Veggie Bowl is also another good option and I'm pleased they can make anything vegetarian. Worth a stop for lunch, however, the parking lot is tight and I have been here more than once when it was full.
other I cant get enough of the Chicken Pesto with Feta sandwich here.  This place has a great sandwich for a reasonable price.My only complaint is that they literally put mushrooms on EVERYTHING, but, if you are a mushroom fan, live it up. On another not, if you like fresh lemonade, you must get a glass of it here.  It goes great with any sandwich.If you are in a Pasta mood, The chicken pesto pasta is excellent.
other Jamba is definitely as good as it gets when it comes to chain smoothie places. We are big fans of the Acai antioxidant smoothie, which is unlike the other smoothies that we've tried there. It is super healthy and has a distinct flavor to it which we like because it's not as sweet as their traditional smoothies are. I like going to Jamba because they are always reliable, fast and friendly when we have visited, even if the smoothies are a tad pricey. But, you get what you pay for, and I would much rather pay a little extra for a consistently good smoothie that I know will be delicious than take my chances on an unknown place that most likely won't deliver the goods.
other After unsuccessfully attempting a walk in gel at the posh looking "Sundrops" nail salon with my two year old in tow, I was drawn to a half deserted strip mall just down the street and a small space in the center labeled Andy's Nails. I Yelped the place and saw the decent reviews so I walked in and was immediately attended to by the friendliest faces I've seen in a while. Despite the fact that I was short one babysitter, they began work on my nails right away and when my toddler got restless, one of the very nice owners picked her up and carried her around for 20 minutes!  Not only do they now offer Gelish gel manicures but they offer more colors than many other Arcadia/Biltmore/Camelback Corridor nail salons AND they're cheaper by anywhere from $5-$20! I'm definitely going back and going back soon! My toes are lonely...
3 This store is a average. It has a six month wall. This place does not bag and board new issues unless asked. The store specializes in new stuff only and has almost no back stock. The store has tournaments for card gaming on weekends. The staff doesn't talk to new customers much or ask them if they need assistance. Note for true comic fans...This store is good for new comics on Wednesdays and supplies but that is about it. Dime-a-dozen store... nothing special.
3 Food was good. I had the Choppino Fruittas de Mare. Apparently the serving is large as the server hinted that it may be too large for me, but the serving was typical for a Fruits de Mare type plate that I've had at other restaurants. Sauce was nice: spicy and good flavor. Pasta was cooked well and the right portion size, I think people add too much pasta to make the dish look larger. Other than the imitation crab (a disappointment but not a deal breaker) the seafood was cooked nicely between the calamari, mussels, etc. Kid's spaghetti was very good. I taste all the kid's spaghetti since I have 3 kids and invariably someone doesn't finish or even start their bowl. The pasta was cooked well, the meatball was decent, but the sauce was shick and chunky (not watery which I hate) and covered all the pasta (which for some reason other restaurants can't seem to do). There isn't a specific kid's menu but the server said they make kid's portion size of anything on the menu but the price isn't available to be seen so you have to trust they aren't going to bend you over on those, which they didn't. Bread, of course, was available prior to meals. The butter used is very tasty, some type of garlic I think. Bread was warm, soft, and not overcooked.Now I would have given other stars except for a few exceptions: the decor and slower service. Decor was dreadful, sorry. Old and dated. I think their target demographics is 50 years old or greater as the chairs, pictures, and everything inside screams 1970's. The chairs remind me of an old conference hall. The lighting is on the dark side. I guess if I was out on a date or with other retired couples, it would be a nicer decor, but with 8 adults and other kids it just doesn't fit quite right.Kid friendly not quite, but kid accomidating is more like it. Since the ambience is darker and softer volume on conversations, having loud and obnoxious kids is not the right place for them.Overall, the food is good, servers friendly but not the family friendly place I usually prefer.
other Pure Bliss - I haven't had a quality meal experience like this in a very very long time.  The full other course dinner was stupendous and well worth every cent. You MUST try the Yin & Yang Martini!  It was  a very creative and well presented drink  that had me all smiles.  I had the Smores & Chocolate desert and it was hands down my favorite (I've tried at least other others).
other I joined a friend for a two hour evening ride at CCO. We were the only two riders, may be because it was a Sunday eve and all the tourists were drinking their mimosas by their hotel pools.The horses looked very well taken care of. Mine was 17 year old Sundance, a beautiful brown male. I've never ridden before, and he was easy to control. Our guide Ed was patient, funny and awesome company. He showed me the basics and was always there with a word of encouragement and a tip or two.Tip for the guys, if you plan to trot, wear tight jeans, you will be thankful at the end of the day. The city slicker that I am,I left my phone in my shirt pocket, ended up dropping it while on the ride and Ed helped us go look for it. The desert, sun set over the mountains and the sandstorm about 30 miles away all made this a very memorable evening.I highly recommend CCO.
other I went to Wildflower looking for a lunch spot that had wifi. I arrived at 11:30, and noticed every table in the small place was full. It was my first time there, it seemed a lot like Paradise Bakery (which is a good thing), so I ordered, hoping a table would open up. Price was about the same as Paradise. By the time my food got there, no tables opened, so I got the food to go. I got home, opened the food, and much to my dismay, it was quite a bit worse than Paradise. Also, no delicious cookie. Next time I'll just drive up the street a couple miles.
other Ahh what a nice place to let your four legged friend run free! This park is huge, spacious, lots of trees, benches (for the two legged friends) and trash cans. One of the best  bark parks in the Valley. Not too many complaints other than the jerks who refuse to pick up after the doggies. People please, they have pooper scoopers, baggies, and trash cans, it couldn't be easier. Oh, and if you have an aggressive dog, maybe take him for a walk outside instead of letting killer on the loose in the park. My Golden is notorious for being over friendly and ran up to a huuuuge bull mastiff (I shall not name names, but it rhymes with bing!) grabbed my golden by the neck and pinned him down till we removed the mastiff off. Anyway, point it... it's a dog friendly park... let's keep it that way. Oh and another reason to keep the kiddies out, I think there's even a sign posted up there. I see kids running up to dogs over petting, grabbing tails, etc... not a good idea. Read the signs parents, it's for your own benefit. So bring your dogs here, they'll have a blast playing, running, smelling this and that, good times.
3 I have never actually been to a pawn shop for any reason. I can't honestly even tell you what they are used for. I have never seen Pawn Stars. I don't watch television. I really enjoy this signage. On an almost daily basis. Savy, that is all it is. Love of a little morning chuckle.
other I had eaten breakfast twice at the Chandler Chompies and loved it so I wanted my husband to try them.  However, we went to the Tempe location instead.  Much older restaurant (pretty worn) and it took some time for me not to be grossed out by the nasty overall smell of the place.  My breakfast wasn't half as good this time and my husband didn't like his either - just boring and not repeatable.  Hoping he'll give me another shot and we'll make the drive out to Chandler next time.
other I don't think I've ever been to this place when it's not been crazy busy. It's just a small little eatery, but it's always busy. They have some great food and the peanut butter pie is delicious. Just a place to hang out and enjoy some breakfast, lunch, dinner or snacks at. Parking isn't the best and that is a problem, but if you live close and can walk, its ideal.
other I am glad I found this place but it is a bit far from where I am staying at in Phoenix. Their dumplings are really good, spicy cold potato salad was super good and refreshing but their green onion cake was a bit thick and starchy for me. I prefer Taiwan's thin and crispy green onion cake. Really clean inside and it is fresh, full of Asians!
other This place is so cooli was startled to find that Tempe has something like thisIt reminded me of the C.A.T. in Eugene.There are soo many bike parts, and tools, frames of all kindsfrom what i've learned is that you can pay a small sum and build your own bicycle here, or offer to volunteer and have your bike for free by working off the debti came here a while back to see if they had anything of interest, and wouldnt you know it that on my way a nut and bolt fell off of my stirrup so i thought perfect, now i can get anotherthe dude running the operation didnt charge me a thingso i left like a $other in the tip jarit's such a priveledge to have something like this for the community, i just hope enough ppl reinvest their time into it so it can exist for generations of cyclists to come.
other I used to be a HUGE fan of the breakfast club, even when I had to wait in the 100 degree heat with a hangover and now I am not. I have had the eggs Benedict, the breakfast burrito, and the Greek omelet and they are all bland and quite frankly taste the same, even with the red and green sauces on the burrito. I ate there again last weekend (because my boyfriend wanted to) and I had the lox and bagel, which was down right gross. The salmon was the nastiest color and tasted almost as bad. The bagel, was well, a bagel, but not even a good one at that. Next time I am in Scottsdale I will be going elsewhere for breakfast, I'll skip the wait and the bad food.
3 It was maybe two months after this place opened that I decided to give it a try.  I didn't go to the restaurant, opting instead to use their delivery.  I placed a large order for two (~$80) and the food was ready and delivered withing 30-4other minutes.  The food was of decent restaurant quality and definitely a good place to get steaks, but it was no where near the quality you would get from Texas Roadhouse or Outback and neither is the price.  I'd definitely recommend trying them if you are looking for a cheat, good steak fix.
other ...The best Pad Thai I've ever tasted!!!  Crab Wontons melt in your mouth!!! Excellent service... GO !!!
other "One, two Feddys coming for you!" "Three, four better lock your door!" "Five, six pick up a crucifix!" "Seven, eight better stay up late!" "Nine, ten if Freddy Kruger went to Lush he'd have had great skin!"Dude, this place is AMAZING! All of their products are all natural, freshly made without preservatives, and are just incredible.  My best friend and  went here after a four martini lunch plus shopping, and we had a had treatment done with their Ocean Salt Cleaner and exfoliator.  It is made with sea salt and smells just like a margarita!  his was followed by using their dream cream, and now I am hooked!  And it's not just the martinis!  I have very sensitive skin, and I have never had a reaction.  They also have a great men's line as well.  I have been using the Ambrosia Shaving Cream for men as well on my face, and I have no razor burn.  It is like a light cream that moisturizes while I shave.  Wow!  I have never felt good after a shave!Anyway, I could gush all day about this place, but the bottom line is it has incredible products that are all natural, and many are vegan,  the staff is amazingly helpful and not at all phony, and even though it may seem expensive the products last for a long time, so the cost is really not that high.  Get thee to Lush!
other went here for breakfast with some friends. it was pretty busy and only had to wait maybe 10-1other mins to be seated. not too bad. quick service, we had coffee almost immediately. the food was delicious. standard breakfast food in my opinion. i got the corn beef hash meal. everything was good, and cooked the way i like. i would definitely come back here if i was in the area!
other Another new great place in the Arcadia neighborhood  to grab some great food and select a drink from the extensive beer and wine list.  I think there were over 60 beers and 40 wines to choose from.  I thoroughly enjoyed the tomato and candied pancetta bruschetta and the lamb kefta...yummy!  Definitely check this place out when the weather is cooler and you can enjoy the view of Camelback Mountain from the patio.
other Worth the drive and more!!  This absolute gem in the west valley is exactly what we need to have and support.  a family owned business that is TOP NOTCH!!  The food was exquisite and the service responsive and attentive.  I am a HUGE fan.
3 Hidden House has some things you expect in a neighborhood bar: lots of pool tables, giant circular bar, tagged restroom, friendly locals (somehow curious or maybe protective), cheap cocktails and specials on pitchers of beer. Then there's a few things different about this place: an usual mix of suits and sweat pant, old and young, some talented pool players and a really smooth bartender. Located in the "new" downtown and within walking distance from my hotel. The walk there and back was actually as much fun as sitting in the lounge, some parts of downtown are stunning especially at night when the lights are on and nobody's "home".
3 Went here before the Jason Mraz concert and the Rock Shrimp appetizer, beers and cocktails were very good, however the service was a little slow. I ordered the angus cheeseburger and it came with a 1000 island dressing and pickles, a glorified Bigmac, what a disappointment.
other Service at this location is superb and worth the wait when they are busy. Price and selection are awesome too!
other I have been dining at this Indian restaurant for a few years now.  It was introduced to me by a close friend.  I have taken my co-workers, members of my ward, my mother and brothers and finally I get a chance to review it online.I don't mind going in for dinner, but the buffet is to die for.  Their consistency has never failed.  This place is great!
other The pork chop & eggs w/ home fries is out of control.  I feel the same way about this place as I do Roscoe's.... you don't go for an egg white omelet, you go to just enjoy yourself & eat some food that your grandparents used to make the old school way, butter & grease.  Just too darn good to pass up.
other PBR. Mad Dog 20/20. What??!! I was a witness to someone drinking Milwaukee's Best Light. Damn son. I guess if youre going to do it, do it cheap.Get there early if you're going on Saturday morning for the game, it fills up quick. All in all, it is was it is. An Ohio bar, watching football, peeps getting sliggity sloppt. Most are still drunk from the night before. Makes for good people watching practice. Make friends with your neighbors when you find a seat. They could be from Ohio and a new person to be "besties" with.Nice!! Thanks Mickey's, you rock... and roll.
other we come here about once a week. the soup in a bread bowl is yummy- i usually get a wildflower salad with the pesto vinegarette, which is amazing! their grain mustard is also amazing and the service is usually very good. the clientele can be interesting so it is a good place to people watch :)
other This place has apparently been open for about 2-3 weeks.  I headed here with some co-workers for a late Friday "meeting".  Otherwise known as happy hour! They have a good selection of beer on draft and bottle.  I had a New Belgium Super IPA that they had on draft and one of their sausages(Chicken and Apple) topped with some sauerkraut and mustard.  It was quite a good combination and was recommended by our server.If you're looking for food, then you may be disappointed in the small amount of options, however, when you realize that their kitchen is the size of a small closet, it kind of makes sense. With the cooler weather right on the horizon here in the valley, their very large patio area should come in quite handy.I will definitely try them out again.
other I visit this Subway several times a week. Staff are very friendly. Good customer service. Ingredients seem pretty consistently fresh. It's a standard Subway but differentiated by friendly staff and good service.
other This place is the best place I've found so far for sushi in the Phoenix area.  The wait staff is always attentive, the sushi isn't overpriced and  their specialty sushis are actually good.  They stick to the basics, and don't veer too much into the west for their ideas.  The plates and silverware are clean, which is more than I was able to say at a different place I'd tried.  The sushi prices are similar to other places I've seen - except you get 3 pieces, not 2.  They don't stick too much rice in the rolls.  The pieces can sometimes push the limit, but most are manageable.  All in all, this is a great place that I will come back to time and again.
other I had the Crispy Steelhead, and it was delicious! The sweet pea risotto and roasted tomato-chanterelle ragout were a great addition. If you're looking for a great restaurant with an original menu, this is the place to go! Friendly staff and they were quick to seat us.
other 3 syllables for this place. A-MAZ-ING!The best Phoenix has to offer.
other My wife and I absolutely love this place.  Yes, it's a bit pricier... but yu get what you pay for: excellent food and service!  The patio is even cigar-friendly, which is a huge plus for us!  We visit often!
other I tried to give full marks to Lolo's having heard all the hype. Realize that I am coming from Louisiana and also New York City where one can obtain the namesake specialty rather easily and in variations.Instead of telling you all the cliche things that you will need to know about Lolo's, I am going to tell you why ultimately I did not "drink the kool-aid on a  other star rating.  Better pricing is the missing star.  I found the place to be on the expensive side for what you get.  It is perhaps a part of my relationship towards this home cooking that makes me feel this way.  But please note:  Service was great...but don't plan on being in and out for a quick lunch unless to do a to go order... Also, these waffles are wonderfully flavored.  I detected a nice hint of vanilla and a touch of cinnamon.  The chicken is nicely seasoned...nothing greasy about this batch.  I will also say that if you are not used to Kool-Aid, or if you are like me and used to be able to water that thing down until the original colour had faded by simply adding batches and batches of sugar to it.... You will be in for a diabetic shock! Here's what to do: Ask for a side glass of water and then inject some of the kool-aid into the water.  My favorite is grape drink!!!  I am hoping to get back to Lolo's to try their gizzards.  I had the basics on this trip and it is really worth the return trip.  Bring your friends and go and eat late there on Friday night!
other One of favorite happy hour places in town. If you get the wings here it shouldn't matter if you get anything else. Great location and nothing else needs to be said. Maybe a renovation on the parking lot.
other Do not bother going anywhere else. This is the place to go for laser. No contracts, easy to get appointments, very reasonable. The staff is fantastic, every one of them. I usually go to Kristen, but all others are as equally friendly and competent. Location is very convenient also. I have looked, and I have received many groupon and living social offers from other places, but I never bothered. This is the one.
other Well, I've been to Liberty Market several times now and it's time to add my two cents. Yes, I know, there are already 250+ Reviews, what more could I add? Don't worry, I'll stick to the facts; consider this the cliff-notes version.Take the first parking spot you can find or drive the the lot west of the building. Walk in, grab a menu, and get in line.  With all of the goodness on the menu, try to make your decision before you get to the register.  A few of my favorites1. CORTADITO - coffee drinkers, do NOT miss this one!  Cuban miro-latte, on the sweeter side, served in a pair of espresso shots or a bowl, perfection!2. Rancher Salad - steak, caramelized onions, blue cheese, arugula, do I have to keep going?3. Sweet Potato Salad - a unique salad, SO much better than your average potato salad4. Cinnamon Rolls the size of a human face, if you're into to that kind of thing, share with a friend, or four.there are more, but I promised to keep it short.Back to the line. As you're making up your mind, be ready to answer the number of people in your party so they can set you up with a table.  Try to resist the incredible looking, super-sized pastries and desserts in the case, or not, what the heck, just get it!.  Pay the friendly cashier, proceed to the fountain drink station to fill your glasses, and maneuver the maze of tables to find the one with your number.Just a few tips.  One, it can get a little noisy in there, so may not be the best place if you're planning a discussion over your meal. Two, LM gets busy and the staff is always trying to find a table for the guests in line by the time they finish at the register.  So, while the dining room attendants are friendly and attentive, they are definitely trying to turn the table as soon as you'll let them.And now you know what to expect.  If you don't like lines or loud places, this might not be your favorite place. Overall, delicious, fresh food and shinny, happy people to bring it to you.  Let's just say LM is enough to get me out of my five mile Ahwatukee radius, and that is hard to do! Now you know the scoop . . . I'm out!  Enjoy!
other Had the pleasure of enjoying House of Tricks last night, for the second time in the past twelve months.With a party of six, I was excited to get to see a range of dishes and try out most of the menu via my dining companions choices.  The restaurant, found in Tempe near ASU, is not hard to find and houses both indoor and outdoor seating.  The outdoor seating is where we ended up last night and between the fire pit in the middle of the grounds and the abundance of trees/greenery, the setting works quite well.  Our party was seated immediately and without problem, the night was off to a solid start.  Our waitress, Jamie, was both friendly and courteous.  Jamie had a great understanding of the menu, the specials and especially the wine.  Her recommendations for multiple members of the party worked out perfectly.  Each person in our party ordered an appetizer and off we went.I had the pork belly, on Jamie's suggestion. Other choices within our party included the salmon cake, sweetbreads two ways, and the scallops.  I thought the pork belly was great. It had a pea puree as a base sauce and some baby carrots that just killed.  The scallops were tasty and cooked perfectly.  The sweetbreads two ways were a bit of a letdown.  As a lover of sweetbreads, I have had the pleasure of tasting some of the best variations of there preparation. These were just not that great.  They weren't cooked properly and the seasoning was lacking.  This would be the only lacking dish of the evening.For the entree, I had the pork osso bucco.  This was a real treat, cooked evenly, tender and tasty.  Other entree selections around the table included the ahi tuna, the salmon, and the duck.  The tuna was the standard seared variety on a bed of mashed potatoes.  Both diners who chose this selection were quite satisfied.  My companion had the duck and while she certainly enjoyed the dish, she found the duck slightly fatty.  All around, the entrees were solid and plates were cleaned.  With little room left for dessert, we ordered three selections for the table to share.  All were good and once again our plates were cleaned off.  The dessert best was agreed upon to be the homemade smore the restaurant produces.  All in all, this is a solid restaurant with a good atmosphere and good service.  I would eat here again and recommend you to do the same.
other Because sometimes you just want to flip the bird at calorie counting and healthy living.  This valley landmark is the place for satisfying that once in awhile sinful urge to screw up your carefully laid out dietary plans.
other This is hands down the best place for bagels...but more importantly... after all my travels it has the BEST Bialy ever.I just wish they would open on in Greenville.Oh it is soooo good, a poppy seed bialy toasted with cream cheese...I guess I can only hope they are always open when I visit Scottsdale....n
other Had just gotten off a long flight and wondered into Aunt Chiladas for the first time.  Loved the food and the margaritas !!  Will go back again.
other My boyfriend and I decided to try Boulders out last night because we wanted some good beer and it's within walking distance of my condo. Good choice on our behalf! We arrived around 10:30 pm, so we took advantage of reverse happy hour ($other off most pints on draft). They were also having half price pizza night, but we had already eaten pizza earlier in the evening, so we did not get a chance to try the pizza. Had we been hungry, it seemed like a great deal.I was VERY impressed by their beer list! They had the biggest beer selection I've seen anywhere. When I was shopping at a specialty store last week, I noticed a "Maui Brewing Co. Coconut Porter" that l was very curious to try - but I passed it up because it was $10 for a 4-pack (ouch). I asked the bartender at Boulders (Rob) if they happened to have that specific beer - and to my utter surprise they did! I was happy I was able to try it out before shelling out ten bucks to buy a four pack at the store. Two thumbs up! Speaking of Rob the bartender, he was great. Very fast to take care of all the customers around us as well as my boyfriend and I. Made sure we had everything we needed without being intrusive. Overall, I had a really good first experience at Boulders on Broadway, and I will definitely be back. I dug the old-school ambiance with the wood paneled bar, we received very good service, and the selection of beer was amazing - truly something for everyone. If you live in the area, I'd recommend checking it out!I plan to get some friends together and go back for one of their "team trivia nights" soon - sounds like a blast.
other Tradition at it's most... er.... um.... traditional. Every time i eat here i feel like i have been transported to any number of old family owned steakhouses on the North Shore of Long Island, or Brooklyn. The plush red velvet, the dark wood and button tufted leather... The place just screams STUFFY BUSINESS LUNCH. My first experience here was with a bunch of lawyer friends who were dying for meatloaf or a steak with creamed spinach... The entrance is through the kitchen. That may seem a little odd, but I'd bet it sells dinners. Who can resist the wonderful aroma. By the time you reach your table, you crave rare beef, as red as the decor. It's the kind of place where you forgo the trendy drinks and have a Scotch with a splash,or a Rob Roy before dinner. The steaks are perfectly prepared, the garlic mashed potatoes are wonderful. I love the place. It isn't cheap, and admittedly, i have never paid for my own meal there. It has always been a treat from some friend who wears a suit to work, or some more traditional back easterner who wants to share their bit of meat and potato lovers heaven.
3 Dropping down to three stars ... On a recent visit, I saw TWO roaches on the main floor of the restaurant. No one seemed to care, so I got up and stepped on one.  I pointed out the other, and one of the staff killed it, but they didn't seem surprised.  I know that roaches are hard to control, but having two of them wandering about in a busy restaurant just isn't a good thing. Also, our waiter was an overly chatty guy who seems to think we are interested in his voice.  They had some good staff in the past, but I suspect the owner, who likes to get drunk and hang out on the patio, gives me the impression of a guy who would be difficult to work for! The food is still decent and better than anything else I've found, but I'm looking for alternatives ...
other Absolutely sensational food.  We had the evening buffett. I will be driving 40min one way to eat here again.  Wow I just really enjoyed my meal.
other "trendy, loud-music, ok-sushi!" - 2/5When we lived right across the street from the Sushi Brokers, J and I used to go there at least once a month for its happy hour. We probably had been there at least 8 times with friends and family. I have to say that the quality was good for the start but went downhill since then. The price was right if you go during the happy hour. Other time, kinda expensive with the quality and service. It was a seen-to-be-seen place with ok-quality sushi.
other OMG I love this place!!! Im from Canada and this is "continentally" good
other Always fresh and perfectly prepared. This is the only place my husband will take Japanese visitors from out of town. Enough said.
other When a man falls in love, it's a special thing. Not because his calloused hands and heart are finally softening. Not even because he has found something that completes his very living soul. It's special because he is simply, and utterly....happy.Ladies and Gentleman of Yelp....I have found the pizza that makes me happy.I heard all the hype..."best pizza in the country", "Oprah says it's the best", "The Food Network hypes it up", "Chris Bianco learned how to make pizza from Jesus". Ok, I made up the last one.My friend and pizza aficionado, Lance has been known to drive in from Los Angeles...just for this pizza, and then he would drive home. Sometimes, he'd even fly in. It had to be good, right? Tonight, I chose Pizzeria Bianco for my birthday dinner because of the hype. I had made a pathetic attempt to dine here once, but myself and the individual I was with, we both were intimidated by the 3 hour wait. Is any pizza worth three hours? That's a personal judgment call. That night, I ended up dining at Nobuo, across the path....and it was a nice meal.I digress. I've been preparing for this trip. I read up on various press articles, and discovered that as of last week, they are open for lunch AND Mondays! Perfect. Tonight, I dined with my parents. My favorite dining companions. We sat down in the very intimate dining space. No wait at all. Perhaps, people don't know that they are open on Mondays. Fine by me.The decor is nice. Simple, with a classic cucina feel. The brick oven is the star of this place. Clearly.We ordered some bread to get started. It came with a little cup of high end olive oil. Fantastic! The crust was crisp, and the bread was chewy to the point where you can't help but smile when you eat this.The pizza is phenomenal. We ordered two pizzas (for three people). One was half Rosa and half Margherita, the other was the Biancoverde.  This way we were able to try three different kinds of pizza .All three styles were phenomenal. The winner of the three was the Margherita. The tomato sauce doesn't overpower, the mozzarella melts like a dream, and a hint of basil. The Rosa was unique, and also delicious. The Arizona pistachios take some getting used to, but pairs well with the red onion. The Biancoverde was much more complex. Definitely a hearty pizza because of the ricotta cheese. Very tasty. It's topped with arugala, so you will get a nice earthy, and loud flavor. Usually when I eat pizza, I take a bite of the crust, and then I leave the rest. Not here. I went through the entire pizza slice because it's perfect. Chewy, crispy, and full of happy!Take it from me....this place is worth the hype. Look at the reviews from other Yelpers. Even the picky ones love this place.Maybe it's true. Maybe Chris Bianco did learn how to make pizza from Jesus. Sure as hell tastes like it.Now if you are wondering about the other stuff, it was also a five star experience: staff friendly and attentive, and the bathrooms are spotless.Worth the 3 hour wait? YES. Bring all your friends here? YES. Will I guarantee the awesome? YES.#300
3 Went to this place for the first time the other night.. Biggest plus for the place is that it has its own parking with some one checking to make sure you are there for the restaurant, the one thing I hate about downtown is parking. On to the food, a basic dinner of Pork fried rice, chicken chow mien, and Kung Pao chicken... It was okay. The Pork fried rice was basic and the chow mien was too slimy. The Kung Pao chicken was alright, kind of disappointed in its lack of sauce but the veggies and almonds that came where good. Pretty much, this place is good for quick and cheap food.The staff was helpful and kind and the restaurant had a cute downtown vibe to it with a random birdcage in the middle. Overall I would try it again, but will try something different on the menu.
other I was a regular at Mia's first location in Wrigleyville/Chicago. Scott (the original founder/chef and present owner) is the reason Mia Francesca is what it is. Not sure if us folks up here in Scottsdale know how lucky we are he landed on our door step. Food, service, vibe...if I could give it six stars I would.
other Blue 3other has a really great atmosphere and terrific menu.  The menu has everything from soup and salads to sandwiches to pasta.  There is a great beer selection, and happy hour/reverse happy hour in the bar.  They even serve a late night menu in the bar when many places are closed during the week. For late night last night we had nachos, spinach dip (soooo good), veggie platter and wings.  The beer was cold and the food was hot. The server was nice and the bathrooms were clean.
other This is my boyfriends regular spot.  When I was approaching Bailey's for the first time, I was oh hell here goes a crumbly dive bar complete with raggedy cougars, mustaches and beer guts all along the bar.  To my surprise, it is a pretty cool neighborhood spot to get some drinks on the cheap, the margaritas by Clay are great, stiff but not too strong.  Friendly bar staff, wait staff could be quicker, more outgoing, they're "aiight" thoough, lol.  The crowd varies with the day and time, yes there are the beer belly's and the nascar hats being proudly worn, but some evenings they play top 40's and the crowd is younger, and a notch or two better looking.  At this come as you are bar, people seem to have a good time shooting pool and having some belly laughs with friends.  Again, drinks are way cheap and that helps a ton for a fridays night out or pre-drinking on a sat night to get the party started.  It feels like going to Mulligans in Scottsdale, but for a lesser dime and a mile less pretentious.
other Found this place online and we checked it out on Saturday night. It was empty when we got there around 6pm so we were a bit nervous, but the hostess told us it was a late crowd usually and the place was pretty full by the time we left.The food was superb. One of the reasons we chose to dine here was because they offer grass fed organic meats and we split a burger that was very tasty (in fact, neither my wife or I had eaten beef in almost two years!). We also split a great salad with a well cooked Ahi steak and had the bruschetta as well. The whole menu was interesting and we'll definitely be back.The real surprise was the beer selection. Wow. I had a tough time choosing, and then the waitress told me about the special and it sounded so good I couldn't pass it up. It was an agave wheat beer from Breckenridge and it was very tasty. Great little neighborhood place and we'll definitely be back. Hope it sticks around as the spot has had poor luck with restaurants.
other The pizza's very good! Unusual in that you have to order and pay first but they different combo pizzas are good. My favorite so far is the spicy chicken.
other This is the best buffet in Az. HUGE variety from veggie dishes, fish, shrimp, mussels, and even sushi. The quality of food is very good too. One thing I have learned is when looking for good Asian food, look inside! This place is always full of beautiful asian folks so you know its good. Just sayin'. For a buffett, they have a really nice staff. There is a shrimp dish with a sweet cream sauce that is amazing. It is more pricey than most asian buffets but well worth the extra few bucks. I eat here at least once every couple weeks.
other I had a great burger experience here and intend to return the next time I am craving a Fuddburger. I also got to introduce a friend to Fuddrucker's for the first time, so it was a cherry-poppin' adventure. Not only are the burgers here tasty, but I love the fact that you get to pick and choose the toppings from their self-serve produce and condiment bars. One of my favorite things on french fries is Heinz 57 sauce and Fuddrucker's is truly awesome for including that amongst its vast condiment selection.As a professed condiment whore, I was thrilled to discover a new flavor of Tabasco I have never encountered before... and I like to think I really know my Tabasco products, having lived in Louisiana for years. This Fuddruckers special-orders the Sweet & Spicy variety of Tabasco which is not only great on a burger, but would work as an egg-roll dipping sauce. Knowing that I must have it for home use, my dining partner graciously approached the manager who arranged to allow him to purchase a bottle. This was just one example of how efficient, helpful, and friendly the staff here are. Next visit, I will demand to meet the one who refers to himself only as "Mr. Crusty Baker" (see photos).The restaurant also has a lot of shiny fun decor evoking shameless Americana and Route 66 roadside culture. The bright colors and the overindulgence in fast food goodness contributes to a heightened state of arousal that can only be described as a "Burger Party Contact High". You can just feel the burger love... the afterglow punctuated by the difficult click of the seat belt as you strap in for a ride back to a somber, less-gluttonous reality.
3 I am not going to complain about the quality of my manicure! They did a fabulous job...On the other hand their customer service was a little off. Very unorganized and they could just not get it together. It took them forever to assist us since we didn't have an appointment and are not regulars.
other Went here tonight with the padres and husband.  This place is the whole Joes BBQ/Joes Farm Grill owners.  We saw that it was the highest rated here on Yelp for restaurants in Gilbert. Paper menus are available near the counter where you order your meal.  We started with the Hummus + olives appetizer.  Mom and I shared the Apricot Chicken with mashed sweet potatoes, Dad had some steak sandwich with horseradish that was very tasty, husband had the Salmon BLT with avacado.  I tasted everything and ALL the food was delicious!! There were also very interesting and unique beer and wine offerings.  There is an espresso bar that sells various coffees, as well as some sweet stuff.  There is still a little market in the back selling local olive oil from Queen Creek Olive Oil Mill, as well as pasta, pure vanilla extract and other items.I highly recommend a trip to Liberty Market for a fresh, home-cooked meal.
other After 6 years of searching I have finally found Laura!  My brows have never really been "bad" per se, but not great either...I have been searching for someone to show me the hidden potential of my natural arches, and Laura did just that.  After only two visits she has groomed my brows into perfect shape and balance. Its funny how such a small change can make such a big difference! I also enjoy the quiet and private suite with the pretty chandelier to look at during my appointments...and she always has great music playing in the background too!Thanks Laura!
other Don't usually give other stars, but this is good sushi. At first, I was a little skeptic of all the macadamia nuts on their sushi, but it is a great compliment.The rolls are original and all very good. The Climax('s) and the Elliot are my favorite.
other What's up with the premium gas in this state being only 9other grade?  Where's the 93? Anyhoo, this is a very busy gas station at the corner of 16th and Highland. When the pumps are full of cars, it's hard to maneuver in and around the parking lot. The store looks a bit short on supplies, but then again I just went inside to pay. I may give it another try, we'll see.  But I'll look elsewhere first.
other I dont understand how a second restaurant was opened on Tatum . My husband and gave these place too many chances and wach time the food was not impressive. The margaritas come from a stolen recipe from La Pinata Nueva , but too bad they didnt bring the recipes with them. I hope they get it " that maybe if you put alittle quality in the food people will come back".
other As mentioned earlier, the best thing about this place is the super cheap, but super delicious lunch bentos.  You get a main dish, rice, salad, and an orange for under $4. If that's not enough, you can get double meat for a buck or two more.  I highly recommend the ginger pork or the katsu.  My friend I normally go with is a big fan of the white fish (fried or grilled).  The sushi here isn't bad.  It's nothing super special, but I don't come here for the sushi so it's not a big knock against the place.As they would say on ebay: A+++ Great Seller! Would eat here again!!!
other not clean, worst gel manicure ever and ruined my nails--Jimmy finished it --his wife started it.  Nails sanded too thin and they talk to other people and look away while they'e filing, sanding and cutting.  They cut two times now into the side of my thumb nail, which causes it to catch and tear off the same day, or soon.  Their 10 or 12-yr old daughter brought the colors to pick (she is much too precocous to be customer focused--she's narcisstic and I want an adult waiting on me).  They have to open bottles to look at gel color--no samples.  Gel drying machine is sitting on a priority mail box on top of chair in customer wait area.   Pedicure okay.  Won't come back.  This place like many with Vietnamese want your money, they don't understand service (or cleanliness in this one) and why we really come to these places.  They also try and nickle and dime you on price, for instance give you a deal to take off gel from previous manicure, when you're getting a new gel manicure.  They want to use the dremel to sand your nails down to the quick.  How about healthy nails and return visit.  This place I'm surprised stays in business.  Sadly it's not in a category by itself although the others are cleaner.  Jimmy should stay away from nails and customers, and just keep quiet.  The girl might be cute to some customers but I am not coming to have a 12-year old wait on me.  No thank you.
other Good service but the food was horrific. The pollo fundido was dry & no flavor.  Could not eat the tamale it was so bad. Will not go back. I had better Mexican off the neighborhood roach coach.
other This place is GREAT! I must have passed it a million times without knowing that it was tucked away in the complex. The sushi was awesome, the drinks were very reasonabally priced, we loved the decor and the atmosphere was very nice, kinda romantic if you are seated in the back away from the sushi bar. The service was great! We will definitely be going back.
other I love this Gelato! My favorite combination is the panna cotta with the mint chocolate chip. Weird but wonderful. I am rarely down this way, especially since I've moved, but I still fantasize about digging in to this deliciousness!  I only ever had great service, and fantastic product here. So far it is the best Gelato I've had, although I hear Arlecchino's is pretty fantastic as well. I miss visiting Angel Sweet, I will have to go back soon.
3 I've returned to this place other more times after my last review. Wait service was still inconsistent, especially with the dimwitted waitress.The restaurant was plagued with "out of foods" often. A few months ago, the dimwitted waitress didn't tell us the appetizer was out till the end when I initiated the inquiry. Apparently she has already removed the "out" item from our bill.The wait service for my last meal with a group of friends was better at 6:30 PM on a Saturday. We've got service from 3 different wait staffs. They were serving everybody else too. Not just us.The food came out fast and the taste was right on this time. They were out of egg plant. We didn't tell them that 99 Ranch Supermarket was other doors down.So diners, I still consider this place a good choice for authentic foods. I will give 3.other stars this time.
other Definitely going to make this a normal visit instead of waiting 3 years to try it.  Kool Aid in a Mason Jar was all I needed to see to know this was not going to be a typical dining experience and something to remember.  Food was amazing, the staff was friendly and the prices for the portions were more than fair.  Only the off beat location prevents me from making this a other star review.
other We went here for the fabulous UYE. As the restaurant is often empty, Julia though it would be good to give them some business...but in the end it was our group that ended up being given the business. The words highway robbery come to mind, but I guess we weren't really on the highway. The prices listed on the menu really didn't seem that out of line, a bit on the pricey side but nothing alarming. Our waitress slyly sold us a kazillion dollars worth of appetizers that were not on the menu. We got other plates which consisted of other individual sauces with some stuff in them...one had shrimp, one had chicken, one had pork, and one had chihuahua. Oh wait, I think that was the cheese on top. Anyway, the plate with other tablespoons of sauce was not worth the $25...oh wait, we got other of them. The waitress also managed to slip two orders of guacamole in on us for $1other a piece. As far as the entrees are concerned, the portions were small and the food was kind of meh. The mole was way too sweet for my taste. The biggest bummer of all was NO BOOZE! The $120 worth of appetizers would have gone over much better if they were washed down with some frosty margaritas. A couple of pitchers and they could have slipped us some $100 flan.Regardless of the price and the mediocre food, it was well worth going for the amazing company of the awesome Phoenix Yelpers. I don't think I would go back for the food though.
other Went for drinks and appetizers to help benefit Friends of Animal Control and Care and was not disappointed! I am not a big fan of alcoholic beverages but this place made them fantastically. Got the Dr. Funk while my companions got Zombie and Hurricane. All were very tasty especially the Dr. Funk. MmmMMm. The appetizers were well portioned, I got the sweet potato fries and the others got calamri and other fishy foods that I don't eat. No complaints from them so definitely a good sign. Service was great, even though we were doing the special we still received plenty of attention.I will be back but this time to try some food!
other I've been going to Unique since I was little.... when it was called Chic n' Cheap. I always find at least one decent thing at Unique. Granted it doesn't have tons of great stuff, but it is a great stop on a shopping day. And this isnt a psudeo thrift store that more of a vintage store and therefore can charge non-thrift prices. I'm talking shirts under a dollar. yeah.
other When I bought my house, my realtor recommended these guys for the termite inspection.  They found a couple shelter tubes (old & inactive), so I paid them to treat the house and bought a other year "warranty".  Included in the "warranty" is a free annual inspection and any follow-up treatments necessary.  Sounded good.First, the good part: the treatment appears to have worked just fine as I have not seen any new evidence of creepy crawlies munching mi casa.  That's good for three stars, I suppose.  But here's where I have a gripe.  Last fall (other yr in to the new house), it occurred to me in passing that I'd been here a year and that I should be expecting some sort of contact from the termite people to schedule the annual inspection.  A call.  A letter.  Something saying 'Hey, you're due.'  (I don't think this is unreasonable to expect from a service-oriented company.  Shoot, it's been well over a decade since I bought my car, and the original dealership still sends me letters saying 'Hey, you're due for your 150k service!')I hear... nothing.  And pretty much forget about it.  Until...Another year goes by.  I receive a letter from them, "Hey! Your warranty is up for renewal!" I don't recall if the first letter contains (paraphrased) "By the way, we'd love to schedule your free annual inspection!" or if that came in the 2nd letter... or the 1st or 2nd call.  Or maybe it was the 3rd letter and the 3rd call... It certainly was in the 'Hey, your warranty lapsed but if you respond right away we'll re-instate it for you AND schedule your free annual inspection' letter, though.Which, frankly, irritates me.  A lot.  I will not be renewing my "warranty" with this company as my experience has shown that I'd be paying for nothing.  Summary: Treatment? Fine. It was effective.  I have no more signs of bugs.  Service? Awful.  They'll ignore you unless they want money from you."Warranty"? I'm not saying it's a scam, but... um.... I certainly did not receive ANY value for the money I paid them.
other Everyone I've talked to that likes this place says the same thing, "I've been going there for years."  Yes - and perhaps years ago it didn't feel like a dive restaurant in constant jeopardy of being shut down for health code violations.  But now...The food is completely, unmistakably mediocre.  As is the service.  Maybe it's not filthy - maybe it's just the lighting and decor that makes it look like that way.  But I'm pretty sure the roach I saw dart up the wall was real.(Okay - that's a cheap shot - there are probably roaches in many places I've gone and I just haven't seen them.  Fair point.)Nothing about this place makes it a can't miss.  I get the history, the nostalgia, and the fact that some famous people have dined there, but you can find better Mexican food all over the Valley and some just a short drive away.
other I was very disappointed in my encounter with them today.  I have been going there for years and thought they have done a good job.  Today I picked up my Tori Burch purse that I brought in to have a shoulder strap repaired.  The thread they used for the repair was a light cream color.  The purse and the stitching is a mustard yellow color.  It looks terrible!!!  They tried putting some cream colored shoe polish on the tread, no improvement.  Now the thread just looked dirty.  I told them that I was not at all happy with the repair.  They just kept saying in thick accent.  "It's good, I fixed it good".  They would not refund the amount I prepaid,  (prepay only store), or redo it with the correct color thread.  Just kept saying.  "I fixed it good".  Looks like I'll be finding a new shoe repair place.
other Scuzy waiter. Scuzy manager. Overall just a bad experience. The food was pretty awful too. I don't understand how this place is so successful! The food was either waaaay over-seasoned of severely under-seasoned. A hole in the wall Chinese restaurant can produce better Chinese food. And at cheaper prices. Search around. It'll be well worth it.
other I live a stone's throw from this Safeway and never end up here for groceries. Based on experience, if I cart my lazy ass down to the Fry's at Thomas and 44th, I end up spending about 1/other less on my shopping trip than I do at this Safeway. Everything is ridiculously expensive, even after the "club card" savings. I have no idea why. Is it because it's in Arcadia? Is it the added expense of upkeep involved in over-stocking the wine section, or the fancy olive bar, or the gourmand cheese selection? Or maybe it's the added cost of employing cashiers by not installing self-check out lanes. Do I really have to stand in line for ten minutes behind a suburbanite with 2.other screaming childes just to buy a couple sticks of buttah? And I understand carding, but do you really have to whip out the book to copy down my info and then make me sign my name like three times because my 16-year old self's signature doesn't match my 27 year-old scrawl? Come on, now. That's excessive. I appreciate that you think I'm looking foxy young for my age, but I'd rather hit up the crack pipe-selling liquor paloozas along McDowell than deal with this nonsense.Unless I am in desperate need of an ingredient *stat* or require something special like their amazing Mediterranean olive selection, I'm staying far, far away.
other Good God, where has this been hiding? My bf and I just made our periodic trip to Phoenix and discovered this little gem. From his kids, no less. We went during the 8pm-10pm Happy Hour...on a Friday night. We got a table in about 20 minutes for 6 of us. Our server was super friendly and took our drink order right away. The cosmos and appletinis were $other and the sake bombs (with Kirin or Sapporo) were $other and numerous rolls were $other each; how do you beat that? The food was spectacular. We ordered off of the regular menu (other orders or tuna tataki, other orders of heart attacks, and a dragon roll) and the happy hour menu (crispy spicy tuna, philadelphia roll, calamari roll, shrimp tempura roll and a couple of others that I can't seem to remember). OMG, one slice of that tuna tataki and I was SOLD. This was some seriously great sushi...Bravo Yen Sushi! Our bill for 6 peeps was $96, that's with the tip included, no less...YAY! I will definitely be back.
other Other than the ambiance of being a  Rock & Roll restauarnt, this place isn't good.  The food sucks.I came in for a birthday party with 6 people, and not one of us actually enjoyed our food.  We had called ahead (other weeks) to reserve a table before a game.  When we got there, the table had not even been set up.  We were 20 minutes later than planned getting to our table, and we missed other entire 1st inning and the top of the 2nd because it took so long to get our food.
other White tank is still an excellent place to hike. I hadn't been here in about 8 years. I was really shocked to see all the new construction near the entrance. A shame really. The flowers were in bloom, so that was a bonus for sure.
3 The best example North Scottsdale has of traditional Phoenix sonoran mexican food.  Los Olivos restaurants have been around forever - at least since the '60's.  The food is great if not fancy, and the place is pretty free of gimmicks.  You can get your fix of cheese crisps (aka quesadillas for you CA transplants), deep fried tacos, chimichangas, combination plates with so much sauce and cheese you can't tell what's underneath but it all works together to taste so good.  Los Olivos still plops down the free chips and salsa right when you sit down so you're good an full when that combo plate comes and glad for it.  The atmosphere is more like a nice mexican diner than mexican cantina and service is solid. They often have mariachis playing on weekend nights.  Margaritas aren't great, but the beer is cold.  Don't bother with dessert.  Cheap eats for all the food, especially since you won't be hungry for another 2other hours.  If you're in North Scottsdale and in the mood for traditional Phoenix style mexican food, Los Olivos is a great choice.
other The food here is generally pretty good.  Drink selection is great.  Service is normally above average.  The only thing stopping it from getting other stars is that it's a bit expensive relative to comparable quality places.
other While visiting Arizona we were told we must try Macayo's. The margaritas (fruit flavored and blended) were a bit on the sweet side- to the extent that I was worried I might get a tooth ache. The prices here are very reasonable. I had the fajita quesadilla, delicious- I cant stop thinking about it. The service was friendly and somewhat efficient. This isn't a place you go for decor and ambiance- but they do have outside seating, always a plus in my book.
other I used to go all the time when I was in HS and last trip I noticed some change over of the stores from what I remember. The food court has okay variety, but not a whole lot. I think that the management company neglected this place for too long, it definitely needs its facelift. It's great for its convenience if you need to pick something up real quick but I wouldn't be spending all day there.
3 Meh.
other Great Bellini, loved the Seared Ahi, Portabella and Beef Tenderloin Flatbread and Spinach and Artichoke dip! I highly recommend you select the same on happy hour! 3-6pm 7 days a week!
other I still really like the Studio Movie Grill, but sat in the "General Admission" seats last night for the first time, and found that they were not nearly as comfortable as the "Reserved" seats with their own little tables.  Unfortunately.The GA seats are also quite tightly shoved together, so if it is a full house you are bumping up against your neighbor, and it is distracting.Best bet:  Go to a un-crowded movie and sit in one of the reserved seats that is not pre-reserved (not pre-sold, and doesn't have the little "reserved" sign on it) to enjoy the reserved seats at the GA price.
other Pure Fitness as a whole I like. No contracts, the people going there are actually there to work out and not to be seen, (ex. LA Fitness). Plus you get complimentary training sessions. However, this location I will NEVER return to and its all because of their new GM Adam. I had a free pass and he was the one that I had been assigned to for my fitness test and 1st training session. I had already explained that I planned to join but he wouldn't stop the full court press of selling which I didnt like at all. I wanted to use my weeks free pass THEN join. He wanted me to give him money right then and there when he hadnt so much as given me a tour yet! Anyway, I told him I wanted to wait and then he starts asking when I get paid, is it a money situation, etc..if made me VERY uncomfortable. I went ahead with the training session and he knew in advance that Im not inactive but going to the gym is not something Ive done on a consistent basis in a very long time. Now I enjoyed the workout but from what others have told me..he pushed me way to hard for my first time out of the gate. My arms weren't sore, I know sore, Im okay with sore but they became weak for FIVE days, that I had trouble sleeping they had that irritable and restless feeling, and it hurt to use a freakin' date stamp at work! But the reason Im not going back..I was surfing them online and saw how easy it was to sign up online so I did. That way I wouldnt have to worry about remembering voided checks etc.  Well I called Adam to let him know and he went off on me.. just short of yelling. "Great, now I lose the commission the gym loses the points.. you can understand why Im upset right." and he went on for about other minutes. I was stunned at how unprofessional he was and he's the GM??? If they work on commission they should give you a heads up "hey I know its easy to sign up online but we work on commission so I would appreciate it if you went through me if and when you choose to sign up". I would have respected that. OR if when you sign up online it allows you to put in the name of the person you have been working with so it doesn't circumvent them. But I was floored and pissed that he came at me like that. Ps. Of all the Pure Fitness this one is the smallest, visually unappealing and has the worst customer service. I did sign up and I love the one I go to now...but this one I will never step foot in again
other My favorite Starbucks in Mesa. It's not even the closest one to my home, but worth the experience. GREAT staff.
other I absolutely love this little spot! It's a great little known boutique with incredibly unique gift items that I don't have to drive clear out to Scottsdale to find. I've been shopping at Vignettes for about 8 years. Whenever I am in a quandary about what to get someone, this is the first place that I head to. Mostly it is because of the wide range of specialty items that they have on hand. Whether it's something for the garden, a gift for the new bride or baby, a unique piece of art, or heavenly scented candles - you will not be disappointed.The owners / staff are super friendly and have always been more than willing to help find something within a price range or based on occasion / need. And they do the most amazing wrap jobs, making gift giving even easier.The final bonus is their annual Clearance sale. For three days each year they basically blow out their stock to make way for new finds. Ask to be put on their mailing list to ensure your have a heads up and get there early because long time customers like myself never miss it. : )
other Charming cafe and it doesn't matter what you order. Breakfast - Lunch - you can't miss.
other The Saguro is a bright, happy place in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale and I, for one, am a big fan of bright, happy places (people, too but that's a story for another time.)It is set up more like an apartment and less like a hotel with lots of buildings scattered about, all surrounding a pool. (There is actually more than one pool to make this happen.) It definitely has more of a party vibe than some hotels, which is just fine by me. I can imagine during the summa, summa, summertime these pools are hopping. And, even though the feel of the place is fun, the staff of the place is nothing less than professional. Every single person I interacted with was beyond kind, helpful, and happy.Whether you need a hotel room for a night or a full trip, a place to hang out poolside, a happy hour cocktail, a casual meeting place, or breakfast or lunch I think The Saguaro just might have you covered. And all with a smile. What's not to like about that?
other Like this location, fairly close to my house and open late. Whenever I'm in the mood for some fresh dogs, I jet over here. Highly  recommend their  ALL BEEF mustard and chili dogs. Check out the fries too, super salty, always fresh and leave you wanting more! Not a big fan of their pretzel or corn dogs- expect a little bit of wait, perfect hot dogs don't take minutes to make!
other So I finally made it to The Grind.  A friend and I went for a late lunch (after 2pm) and had the place pretty much to ourselves so the service was spot on.  We sat at the bar and drank bottled Kiltlifter...I've only had it on tap or from the can so that was a nice surprise.  She had a burger topped with some sort of fried veggies and watercress...I know she loved every bite 'cause she refused to share with me.  I had The Crisp Pork Sandwich.  It was topped with swiss, pickles and iceburg and what I believed to be a house made BBQ suace.  I gotta say I don't know where the "Crisp" part came in and the sauce was good but it didn't blow my face off with wows.  To make things more (or less) forgettable it was room temp, at best.  All that nay-saying aside...I killed the sandwich.  It was a good sandwich.  We shared the sweet potato fritters.  I think I would've liked them more if I wasn't expecting something completely different...something with a "no shit?" factor.  Admittedly, my bad.  But everyone else should know they are pretty much sweet potato mash shaped into coins or pucks, breaded with mild seasonings and fried (possibly baked?).  That's all.  No hating...just saying.  The sweet potato fritters at The Grind are sweet potato fritters....don't get all excited like my buddy and me did before ordering them.  The room was tidy and clean.  The music was the right kinda 2pm vibe.  The bartender was attentive.  The food was thoughtful but possibly not executed to it's highest potential.  They have Kiltlifter in a bottle.  If I were you...I'd go to the grind.  Represent local talent, Phoenix.  Chef McLinn and his colleagues...waiters, FOH managers, dishwashers and prep cooks are the Gin Blossoms or the R. Kline and the Peacemakers, the Jimmy Eat World or Eastonashe, the Headroom of the food and beverage, scene and attraction in this town.  If it weren't for guys like Comer Smith, Jarrod Porter, Jay Bogsinski, Pattrick Fagan, Matt Carter, Payton Curry, Aaron Chamberlin, Chris Curtis, Beau Macmillan, and Matt McLinn we'd have no music-food to listen-eat.  You might not love every single song the band is playing...but just knowing that they're what we got should be enough to get us to invest in understanding their talents and appreciate what they're doing for us.  I can't make a pulled pork sandwich...but I know someone who can.  You should go try these guys out...they sound-taste as good as any sandwich joint could.  All they need is a few more groupies to spread the word and before you know it, The Grind is gonna be a classic.
other Cesar Chavez park is the best that the SW Valley has to offer! Located at 35th Ave & Baseline at the base of South Mountain, it's a great location for the residents of South Phoenix and Laveen. I've seen it very busy, but it also seems to be one of the best kept secrets in SW Phoenix!There is ample seating throughout the park, including ramadas and benches. A 1.other mile trail wraps around the lakes in the center of the park, making it perfect for runners and walkers. There is a small tot lot and playground on the east side of the park that families will enjoy. No matter what time of day you visit the park, you will find people around the lakes fishing. Be careful- a friend once tripped on a fishing line that a careless fisherman didn't remove from the sidewalk and broke his elbow!Drawbacks: this park is always dirty, as no one seems to clean up their trash after visiting and it is not safe in early morning or evening hours. Otherwise, enjoy one of the better city parks!
3 If you have to travel to Phoenix (Yay!) then chances are you have to travel through Sky Harbor (Boo!). There's also a decent chance you'll consider traveling on Southwest (Boo!) but as airlines (Boo!) in Sky Harbor (Boo!) go, you can do worse than Southwest.I'm not a huge fan of Southwest, although I'll give credit where credit is due, and that bags fly free thing is genius. Combine one of my least favorite carriers with what is probably my least favorite airport and you've got a recipe for disaster, but somehow it works out in Southwest's benefit. The gates are just as hard to reach for SWest as other carriers, and you're not banished to the edge of the universe for check-in or for baggage claim. They've got a decent presence here, so you may actually find a human who can help should you have a problem.Yes, they may leave you stranded on the runway for a while in 100 degree plus weather (check) or force you to dash across the airport with late arriving flights (check) but every once in a while it's a painless operation.
other I cannot believe I am about to say this:AIRPORT FOOD IS GOOD.For any of you who eat in airports on a regular basis, you've surely come to accept the fact that airport food just sucks.  It doesn't matter how much you spend:  the bread is stale or soggy, meats are dry and tasteless, and forget fresh veggies and fruits of any quality.I was just shocked when I visited the Roadhouse at Sky Harbor recently.  I had an hour before my flight so I ordered a Stella Artois and a french dip.  I wish I'd had a camera to catch my expression when I bit into my sandwich.  The bread was soft and warm.  The meat was tender and tasty.  The cheese was really good; no joke this was real cheese.  And HOT au jus?  OMFG I almost freaked out it was so good!  I couldn't wait to tell my server how pleasantly surprised I was.  She kinda laughed at me and said they get compliments on their food all the time.  AT AN AIRPORT?  Folks, this is the best kept secret at Sky Harbor.  I will make it a point to go out of my way to eat there in the future, even if my gate is in another termial!!This place is in the low B gates - try it and you won't regret it!
other My review is only for the purchase of a non-disposable diaper at this swim school. As soon as I entered, I was promptly greeted and asked how they could help me. I explained that I was looking for a non-disposable diaper for my lil'un and they asked about weight etc and found the perfect one for her. The lady explained to me that the non-disposable diapers are so good that even if for some reason there is an accidental Code Brown, if you know what I mean, they will not charge their patrons. They really believe in the product that they sell. Their swimming pool looks nice and clean and this could really be a fun place for little kids. I know they do parent and child classes here also.
other There food is pretty good here but they have a lot of different brews, I tried a pumpkin beer witch was very good. This place used to be real quite and unnotice now it's always busy and very crowded. It is located away from mill ave by about 3 miles so if your trying to bar hop make sure you have a dd and stop by this place.
other It's been a few months since I've been here, and what a change, not for the better. I usually get the same thing to start with, ceviche and pollo asado. Both are usually quite delicious, not this time.The ceviche had absolutely no flavor to it. As if the chef tried to make it as flavorless as possible. I did not finish it as it was not enjoyable in the least. Now for the tacos. Stale taco shells, dried and overcooked chicken, slopped on guac and no pico de gallo. The tacos were so bad I tried to rescue them by asking for pico de gallo, since they did not put any on, and then I was charged $1.00 extra. Of course, no manager was anywhere in sight. This place simply doesn't care. On the bright side, the margaritas and salsa are still good, but the chips were stale.Not only will I not return, but I can no longer recommend this place to businessmen from out of town. I see dozens of new business people every day who stay in Scottsdale and they always ask for Mexican food, and I've always said Cien Agaves. No more.
other Best food, super friendly staff, and great prices. Love it!
other The wash ain't bad....but the process to get it done is pathetic.  The ticket writers at the entrance move in slow motion. They try to upsell at every opportunity.  Four cars backed up waiting to order their service...and the crew is standing around with no cars going thru.I'd rather drive my car dirty then endure the agony of incompetent management.
other Last night on my way home from work I figured I would pick up some dinner for me and my wife who is taking care of our newborn all day and has little time to cook for us. I ordered chicken limone the menu says serves two to three and we don't eat a lot so I figured it would fill us up. The price was 18.99 but I figured in a family style Italian place and we should have plenty of food. I was handed my bag and I was sure it was the wrong order because it was so light so I checked it in the car and was shocked. I see three small pieces of chicken in a big container with a small piece of bread and that's it! So I figured they just forgot the pasta and went back in and asked the hostess and she said yes it comes with it then said no after thinking about it. So how can they justify that price? It was so small there was no way it would feed other people so I had to cook pasta at home and then reheat our chicken in the microwave.I worked in the service industry for years and this place is a joke! FYI just because there's people with money who live near your restaurant doesn't mean you can tailor your food prices to their income level without delivering value.........if you sell crap in the worst neighborhood that same crap should be priced the same in a affluent neighborhood....same crap different place.No value means lost customers ....
other Bring an extra sleeve of balls when you play here for all the water hazards! I showed up today (Sunday) and was a little thrown off by all the people at the bag drop wearing football jerseys. Especially when the people wearing jerseys were the ones grabbing my clubs and putting them in a cart. Thought I was at Buffalo Wild Wings! I thought this was a very nice course but the reason it didn't get other stars was because it just didn't have that top notch feel that other Troon managed properties have. The greens were very inconsistent; some really fast, some really slow, and some were bumpy. The grass on gold was extremely long and it was very easy to lose your ball in the rough because the grass was so deep. Blue was cut much better but I had a couple complaints with holes 7 and 9. If you're playing the blue course in the late afternoon, you might as well close your eyes while teeing off at 7 and 9 because the architect made the course so you look directly into the sun. I sneaked on today for $4other bucks and was very satisfied with what I got for the price. If I didn't live 1other miles away, and could always get on for $40 I'd probably golf here a lot more. If the green fees are above $50, I just couldn't justify it with all the other nice options around the valley. On a final note, I was EXTREMELY impressed by the staff and how friendly they were. I was not only asked how my round of golf went, I was also told how glad they were that I came out, and finally that they really hope to see me again. Definitely don't get that kind of service too often!
3 Live very close to this theater so I go there whenever I can. Went to one of the grand opening movies "Avengers". The movie was great but when using the restrooms they are very small for the amount of people going there (other stalls) there was no toilet paper, one was out of order, long waiting lines and one soap dispenser didn't work . Went to get popcorn and watched one of the wait staff take one cup, pour something into another cup then replace the used cup back with the unused ones. The seats in the theater do make you sore after about a hour. They don't rock back and the seats are starting to bow in from constant use so you feel like you are arching forward.
other Very excited to have a neighborhood grocery downtown!  I've been in twice now and was surprised how many people were in there considering they just opened on Thursday.  They have a really nice wine selection without the usual suspects, the cheese case has many nice, reasonably priced offerings and the pastry case looked delicious too!They still have a few bugs to work out, but that is to be expected from a new business.  I definitely recommend enjoying a glass of wine at the bar with some cheese...yummy!
other The food is EXCELLENT!  We have been other times now, and everything we have had has been delicious!  We will continue to dine w Bill and IL Bosco!  The Caprese is AWESOME!
other Thai Basil is just delicious! I love Thai food but i try not t drag the bf along too much since he has not yet found a Thai place that has a dish he really loves but that changes since bringing him here ! WHOOP WHOOP!   Really good and quick service for either eating in or taking to go ( we have done both). He is in love right now with their chow mein and i as always am a big fan of Pad Thai.  their pad Thai is not as spicy as other places i have been which is ok considering i can spice it up myself if necessary. only downfall for me is i am not a fan t all of their sweet and sour pork which is a big deal for me, since next to Pad Thai that is definitely a second.  Their chicken sa tay and spring rolls are really good as well!Cheap!
other I feel bad giving this other stars but I'm basing it on other burger joints in the area. I recently Had a fab experience at Zinburger so this is why they are only getting other stars. Sat at the bar and ordered the cowboy Burger and adult choc milkshake ($14) pretty pricey and tasted just like a reg choc shake?? The burger bun on the bottom was extremely mushy and was not eaten. Overall I just have had better. All the burgers are $16, luckily we said "happy birthday" which is a deal thru today May 4th 3-6 PM that makes one burger free. Prob wont go back.
other I went to Blanco Tacos + Tequila in Scottsdale with my family for my birthday dinner. This is another one of Sam Fox's restaurants, and it serves up modern Mexican fare. Our party of five all got a ton of food that definitely required to-go boxes throughout the meal.The atmosphere at Blanco totally didn't surprise me, considering it's a Fox eatery. There was the open kitchen, huge hanging lights, centrally located bar and airy feel. It was chic and dimly lit with candlelight, but there were televisions throughout broadcasting football games. It was a great mix of casual and fancy, making it the type of place where it's perfectly acceptable to go and just down a couple margaritas, or have a fun dinner date.I started with the Blood Orange Margarita ($9), which you should get with salt even though it's a little sweet. It was a strong drink, and the sweetness wasn't overpowering.For my meal, I started with the housemade guacamole to go with our tasty chips and spicy salsa, then had cheese enchiladas and finished with a Tres Leche cake. The guacamole was so amazing, other people at the table were also inspired to order it for their starter. I really liked the cheese enchiladas, but, as my mom pointed out, they're more modern in that they're not smothered and dripping with cheese. Instead, they're covered in an interesting creamy ancho sauce. I guess I prefer traditional cheese enchiladas, but there was still a ton of cheese inside the tortillas that made me happy.The cake was really interesting. Someone compared it to a bread pudding, since it was really crumbly and wet because it was drenched in a milky sauce. I liked it, but it was too rich to finish.Altogether, I thought the meal was an excellent deal. I would definitely go back for the lively ambiance and tasty take on Mexican food.
other This location has other businesses. A bar and a grill. I never entered the bar. I only eat at the grill for breakfast. I love the food though. This is a great, greasy spoon when you don't care about exotic "gourmet" concoctions an upscale location or an eye catching electronic sign. This place serves your standard menu items. Quality food,  reasonable prices and low overhead. Just the way I like it! The other reviewers commented on the owner and her abrasive nature. I agree she is abrasive but only at first glance. She is funny and sweet if you give her a chance.
other Love the carne asada.
other Don't bother with this place.  I had never been here, my husband and I decided to pick up some food to take home.  We ordered a shrimp tempura appetizer, an assorted tempura appetizer, a lobster appetizer, and yakisoba.  When we got home the order was totally wrong. Instead of lobster we were given mussels (which were gross), instead of assorted tempura and shrimp tempura we only got assorted tempura with 2... that's right only other shrimp in the whole mix.  The yakisoba was the only part of the order they got right and it was not that great, pretty bland.  I love Japanese food and I was really excited to find a place near by and while we were waiting for our order we were excitedly planning to come back and have their sushi, but after this complete mix up and poor quality food there is no way I would trust them with anything raw.  Never going back, such a complete disappointment.
3 I know I might some flack for only giving this place 3 stars, but really....it's no different than Chang's.  If I could give half stars, I would give it a 3.5.  Why?  Because I think it's better than Chang's.  It's exactly the same menu (just not as diverse), but cheaper.  If you are at this location, try Tott's instead.  I bet you'll start going there more often than here.
other Their sandwiches are excellent! I like to get the slider trio with bbq chicken, brisket, and pulled pork. Their potato salad is pretty decent but not as good as grandma's ;). Also, their coleslaw is quite nice but just a touch of too much mayo. Now comes the bad part: the ribs. I absolutely love bbq ribs and unfortunately their's were dry with very little meat on the bone. I would not recommend the ribs here to anyone. Stick with the sammy's and you'll be all good.
other Nobody likes going to the auto body shop..period! These guys took a negative situation and absolutely turned it around. They immediately made me feel at home from the moment I approached the front desk; all the way up to the ownership of the shop. It was a professional experience with a family friendly approach. The work they completed on the rear bumper of my car was excellent. I HIGHLY recommend Impact AB for your AB repair needs.Tom Butka was a pleasure to work with. Thanks Impact AB for everything!
other 2.other stars-went to Lolo's for lunch on a Sunday- the place was nice and busy- waited maybe 3 minutes for a table.  Were seated but had to wait an additional 20 minutes for a high chair as the other they had onsite were being used.  Ordered the Te-Te's (other chicken legs and other waffle) along with French Fries and Beans Over Rice.  Food came out with my entree about other minutes before my friend's did.  We were never brought out the fries or beans and rice- reason for it per the server- there was a big party (8ppl) slowing the kitchen up.Food was good, not great, staff was very nice and hospitable. I will go back to give this place another shot- try something different on the menu as the waffles were super heavy and doughy.  Chicken was cooked to perfection- I swear I could have eaten 10 pieces!!
other Introduced to D'lish today by a friend. I'd already had breakfast (although the menu looks great, lots of delicious sounding, healthy options) but he suggested a Chai coffee. I don't usually like Chai Tea, but I thought I'd give the Chai coffee a chance based on his recommendation.When I ordered, the server suggested a "Sexy Dirty Chai", which as lurid as it sounds means adding vanilla. The Sexy Dirty Chai Coffee over ice is hands down now my favorite coffee drink. The place is tiny, has a really cool, funky interior and also has a drive thru- a true local gem. The service is friendly and energetic and I plan to start my day here again soon :)
other I went here the other day, as I had a Deal Chicken for this place. I used to go to a really good Salvadorian restaurant in Seattle, and was excited to see there was one right near where I live now. So the BF and I got here at around 8 at night on a Sunday and it was actually pretty busy. This place is in a tiny strip mall that does not look like it gets much business, and I would have never seen it from the road, so it must be good to still be in business. So I ordered a pollo pupusa, a carne asada pupusa, and a polla tamale, and the BF ordered two bean and cheese pupusas and a carne asada pupusa and we split the pastelitos con papas y queso. Well, the pastelitos were pretty tasty, like fried mashed potatoes, and they came with a spicier cabbage slaw which I liked a lot better than the regular cabbage slaw for the pupusas. All of the pupusas were really good, my real problem was with the sauce. The red sauce that came with them was just kind of flavorless. The place I used to go to had some really good red and green sauces for the pupusas... it was kind of disappointing. Also, about other minutes after we got the pupusas, the waitress came by and said 'oh I forgot to tell you we don't have any tamales.' Well, that kind of sucks, why did it take til we were already in the middle of eating to tell us? Also, it screwed up the amount I was trying to spend (since I had 20$ to spend on the deal chicken) which I guess shows that this place is cheap, which is good, but for this particular trip that wasn't good. So we decided to order a dessert to replace the tamale. We got the empanadas de platano with sweet cream. So this was a big deal for the waitress, she had already totaled out the bill and for some reason it was a huge deal to add a dessert at the end (which I thought was weird, but felt guilty about giving her extra work). Anyway, the empanadas were ok, but I've had better. The sweet cream is in the middle of the plantain and it isn't all that sweet. Oh well, I would definitely come back here for some yummy pupusas and maybe try a different dessert next time, the central american quesadilla looked pretty tasty....
other I have been dying to go here since a coworker's spouse is one of the chefs. We finally went  last night  before the Symphony and it was a very good dining experience. The food came impossibly fast. The shrimp and Sausage Po Boy sliders were heavenly. The bread is this roll type of joy like break back east. Yum. You know the type of bread you can't find in AZ or west of the Rockies as Al Pacino would say-lol!They also served the bread basket with a veggie type of garnish if mixed with butter and put on the bread it had a very pleasing taste to it. Innovative menu- Lobster Potpie and Duck Quesadillas. HMMMMMM! Interesting. I had a side of Mac and cheese which is what I had heard about for so long and a Caprese Salad. My friend had divine Salmon. I am not a Salmon fan but i tasted it and it was yummers. My Ice tea was tasty and my friend had  a Basil Mojito that was mixed well. I don't like them usually because they are so strong mouthwashy tasting, but this had a nice blend to it. The restaurant decor is beautiful.We did not get desert but I want to go back and try those Seasalt sticks. All in all I loved going here. DT was packed last night due to Wrestle-Mania but we were in and out  in an hour at 5ish, so try that time to avoid crowds. Service was great despite other reviews. I know great service and I had it.
3 It is my favorite vietnamese restaurant.It's small but clean. Their soups are great. They serve fresh and tasty foods.Portion is not big enough for me though.I wish they serve bigger size meals.
other food is good ,but they have to re-model those bathrooms they are piss soaked and the smell makes it all the way to the dining room oooff!!!!!
other I am sad that Lucky's is so far from where we live.  I worked near Lucky's last year and just happened to walk in for lunch.  My lunch was so good I took a huge meat lovers pie home, which was so good my husband proposed all over again!The employees were so friendly and explained that their pizza might take a little longer than normal, but they want to make sure it's right.  I loved everything about my visit there, and was able to stop in a couple more times throughout the year.  It's about an hour drive from where I live, but the more I think about it, I think we're going to have to go get some more Lucky's pizza.  Great neighborhood pizza place!
other This place is very cool and laid back.  Apparently Unlce Bear was someone's dog b/c there are dog pics plastered all over this place.  If you are a dog or even a pet lover in general you would appreciate the decor/vibe of this grill/bar.  It is literally a "throw your peanut shells on the floor" joint (they come served in a dog dish) with very cold beer on tap and an eclectic mix of people that dine here.  The Gilbert location is a bit more conservative versus the East Mesa spot.  People in Gilbert seem to think it's ok to bring their small children to bars! I am a huge fan of the BBQ chicken quesadilla (or you can get it served as a pizza).  I really haven't tried much else on the menu b/c I can't seem to stray from my BBQ chicken; It is yummy and when I lived in the east Valley I would dine there about once a week.
other I went for lunch on a weekend recently.Kimchi pancakes, spicy pork bbq lunch special.The seasoning on the pork bbq wasn't what it used to be.It seems like the texture is dried out and the flavor is bland.The sauce is probably watered down.It lost the yummy sauce/ flavor/ seasoning it used to have.The kimchi pancakes weren't that great either.I used to be so loyal to this place but after being let down the past couple times,I think I might as well just cook at home (and deal with the dishes later)
other The best of all the Harkins. Better array of munchies and really friendly staff. Also, I wasn't overly carded on my inexpensive purchases. At the Superstition Springs location, I'm carded four times between the parking lot and my seat. Chances are...if I steal a credit card, I'm not gonna sit in the same spot for three hours awaiting the po-po.
3 The hubs and I stroll through the indoor market when we are down at the farmer's market on the weekends.  They seem to have a good assortment of items, though the prices are quite high.  But I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt because they are a local business.  One morning we were at the farmer's market and decided to grab something for breakfast - its never a good idea to shop hungry :).  I got in line for coffee while the hubs ordered breakfast.  The coffee is fabulous!  I like my food simple - so when the hubs came back with an egg and cheese I wasn't looking for anything fancy (eggs, cheese, maybe a little butter, salt and pepper on some sort of bread product).  I quickly found out that this was some sort of a hipster egg and cheese. Lettuce on an egg and cheese?  Who does that?  There were also tomatoes, mustard and assorted spices.  I'm willing to admit that maybe its just me and my underdeveloped "simple" palette.  So if you are a hipster and you're hankering for an egg and cheese - this is your place. Regardless, be sure to get a cup of coffee, its awesome!
other The only thing you can say critically about the Thai House is the location isn't a home run.  But get past that, and get inside because the food is top shelf and the recepies are authentic making this a fave five spot for my family.  Start with a Thai Iced Tea, try a spicy soup, and don't miss the curry - but beware of the heat index and order according to your ability to enjoy flame in your flavor!  My personal favorite is tradtional Pad Thai - the perfect balance of peanut and chili spice with sticky noodles & chicken...
other Located next to T-Mobile on the Southeast corner, the parking is terrible because of the "always busy" Paradise Bakery. Good prices (about $1-other less than most other places), quick service, good manicure and decent arm/hand massage, clean place.I plan to come back try out their pedicure soon.
other On a mission to find some University of Michigan apparel that fit my pregnant body, I started my search with a phone call to Sports Authority.  I struck out there within minutes as I was told that they only carry AZ team apparel.  Shucks!Luckily for me, Lindsey F overheard my conversation and suggested I call Bischoff's Shades of the West.  She remembered seeing a ton of college apparel during her last visit to this touristy store with all kinds of inventory including Western wear, food products, jewelry, etc... I skeptically called and sure enough, Bischoff's carries UofM apparel as well as all kinds of sports paraphernalia including hats, t-shirts, shorts, keychains, and more from the NCAA, NFL, NBA, NHL, and more!I headed over that afternoon and found what I was looking for... and now I know where to go when on the hunt for all kinds of random items from AZ novelty gifts to college football attire.  Thanks Bischoff's, and "go blue!"
other This place is great to go to for a chill and low key atmosphere.You can play billiards, cornhole, or video blackjack. One thing I didn't like: one of the bartenders told me there is a $10 minimum to use my credit card and I think he was trying to hustle me because when I went back to close my tab (without buying another drink), the other bartender took my credit card.Otherwise, a nice chill place to go.
other Went today for the first time. The quesadillas were the best I've ever had. My husband had the Cuban sandwich, which of course I tried...it was equally delicious! The atmosphere made me feel like I was back in the Bahamas. And not to forget the staff. We sat at the bar, and the bartenders were wonderful and so nice!
3 As far as basic burgers go this is an OK option. The flavor is ok and basic toppings give everyone enough choice. Better than McDonald's yeah and similar to In-n-Out but nothing really special. Price is not cheap for a burger so I would expect a little more, but not more fries because they give you a bucket full and more.
other I love-love-love Green.  The atmosphere is wonderful and the food even better.   The people who work here are lovely sweet and very helpful.   There are far too few vegetarian restaurants in Phoenix metro area and this one gets my full support.
other Was there last night and had a good time.  I learned several things:  1.  Charlie's has a cover charge of $3 if you get there after a certain time, I believe this starts at midnight or other am.  I got there after other am and the place was packed, absolutely packed.  2.  Yes, in Phoenix, some bars can stay open until other am (gasp!).  Yes, I know, it blew me away as well.  3.  The little Mexican food place attached to Charlie's serves really good food late night, but now I understand why they can't sell water or soda through the inside window to Charlie's customers.  That's because Charlie's wants to charge patrons $2.50 for a bottle of water than the Mexican restaurant sells for $other outside.  Other than that, I had a good time.
other I just started taking my car here a few months ago. Someone from their business stopped by my office building with donuts and coupons for a 60,000 mile check up, and that's how they got my business.I brought my car there for a routine oil change, and they did the 60,000 mile check up which was very useful. Of course there was the usual list of things I should fix, but they never made me feel like an idiot or that they were taking advantage of me, which I can't say for most mechanics.The other thing I really like about them is they give me a ride to and from work, so I can get maintenance done on my car without missing work or worrying about how I'm going to get back to the shop.Bill and the other guys that work there are all very friendly and I definitely trust them with my car needs.
other If your day is lacking a good decision, this place will change the course of your life - at least for an hour.I have only ever ordered the Oggie (I'm a one pasty kind of guy), but most of my friends have had their way with the rest of the menu and it doesn't disappoint.Easily one of my favorite spots in Tempe.  It's also a much larger version of its former self so you no longer have to gladly wait an hour for a table.
other The workers here are SO friendly. The minute you walk in the door you'll here a "Hello, welcome to paradise!" and if you stay to eat/study/chat you'll probably hear it every few seconds.I love coming here to study. They have lots of chairs and booths that welcome it and the staff, of course, does not care how long you sit. Food is decent. There are better bakeries in general but I can say that their cookies and salads are worth trying.
other Brookstone is the Sharper Image's older and more laid back cousin.  Yea, it's got a similar feeling, but it's more focused on keeping you relaxed and healthy than on funky electronic toys.  The massaging chairs, pads and other devices are enough motivation to stop in alone.  And if you're with a partner who's less interested than shopping, it's a great place for them to just hang out too!  (Trust me - this works.)
other A nice place to go to catch the blockbuster movie again or catch a movie you didn't feel like paying $10-1other during the first run. I've been here for a handful of movies and I've always had a pleasurable experience. The price is right, $3 per ticket for every show, any time. The price is $other on Tuesdays.I normally don't hit the concession stand, but there is a wide variety of snacks that seem to be a bit cheaper than other movie places. The first time or two you go here, make sure to check out the items in the cases, walls etc. There is a bunch of cool pics, figures etc.Is it just me or does Pollack look like the Lion in the Wizard of Oz?
other Blue Martini hosts "Take The Stage And Be The Lead Singer Of The Band" on Monday Nights. Usually there is a band that sings top 40 but on Monday nights anyone can go up there and sing. My friend loves karaoke and was dying to get up on stage and have her moment so I went for moral support. BTW she rocked! Most bars are dead on a Monday so I was surprised that there was a decent crowd here. No cougars in sight the whole night! The drinks specials aren't that great but you can get $7 specialty martini's or if you go with a group of people you can split a bottle of vodka for $100.
other This is the location I frequent most (it helps it is less than a mile from my home). I have been to a U.S. Egg (this and other locations) more than a dozen times (or two) since moving to AZ in 2010. I love breakfast food and the "specialty" won me over instantly; PROTEIN PANCAKES! As the timeless Tina Turner once said, "Simply the Best!". That describes these pancakes perfectly. Before I go on and on about the pancakes (because I have been known to do so) some background information about atmosphere, staff etc. This location is in a nondescript one story building in front of the offices at Mill Towne Center (or is it Mill Town Centre?). Nothing fancy, but I don't need a "Jacket Required" sort of feel to a place to enjoy my breakfast. The staff is fantastic; hosts/hostesses, waitresses, busboys. I have never had anyone employed here be anything but 100% professional and attentive. To speak to something others have mentioned about getting the check early (while they are still eating); as long as you continue to be my waitress (i.e. refills, requests for jelly, etc.) I don't care if you bring the bill with the food. If I decide I want something else, I doubt any of the folks here would have a problem reprinting a corrected bill. Now on to the food!! The protein pancakes are filled with blueberries, granola, cinnamon and silvered almonds. The ingredients aren't something exotic, but they are perfectly balanced in the mix (not too much or too little of any of them). The thing about any food item you like at a restaurant, it becomes a favorite because they are able to duplicate it time after time. I have had this item many times (more than any other item), and they are always spot on (knock on wood) :). All the other dishes I have had (always breakfast, haven't tried lunch yet) were some combination of eggs and protein, and the eggs are always perfectly cooked to my specification (over medium), and the meat always juicy. I promise to write another review as soon as I don't get the protein pancakes (which will be when they decide to remove them from the menu - NEVER). :) Oh, or if I actually go in later than normal and feel like lunch over breakfast (not good odds :O).
3 I've only eaten the buffet here and it was good but nothing special.  To be fair, most Indian buffets are pretty similar, it's only when you order from the menu that you see if the restaurant is really a stand-out.  So, I will update this review when I've gone there for dinner
other The valet guys were absolutely awesome.  They were the best part of my stay at this hotel.  The grounds were okay - NOT other star quality.  The decor in the rooms seemed old, and the color scheme was dated. Although most of the staff was friendly, we did have a pretty bad encounter with the pool manager.  My husband and I had bought a bag of popcorn at the grocery store and were snacking on it poolside.  The pool manager came up to us and informed us that outside food is not allowed in the pool area.  She told us that we needed to put our food away.  She then left without even offering the opportunity to order some Fairmont approved food.  It was really strange and off-putting.  We had been sitting by the pool for over an hour and not a single person from the wait staff had come up to us to take our drink/food orders.  Also, it seems a bit ridiculous that we can't eat our own bagged popcorn.  It's not like we were chowing down on a big meal and making a mess.  It made the resort seem elitist.  I definitely won't be staying here again.I've stayed at the Hyatt Regency Scottsdale before and would definitely recommend that hotel over the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess.
other I will have to disagree with many of the previous writers here.  I have been to Michael Minna in San Francisco, which is way more famous and crowded but this one is better.  Let's begin with something that impressed me.  When my partner and I sat down, someone came over and immediately handed her a black cloth napkin.  Sounds simple, but it's nice when you have nice black pants on and don't want white crap all over them.  Second, the food was great.  The duck fries were really good (and free)... I had a great corn chowder with cilantro and a small grilled cheese sandwich which was perfect. (I never eat those). My main course was a skirt steak in a fantastic sauce.  My dessert was beignets and creme brulee.  The beignets were great and the creme brulee was good.  (My gf makes it much better)...we each had two drinks, a pear martini which was excellent and an even better white cosmo.  All in all, the food was tasty and the appearance of the place was nice and swanky.  It's about time Scottsdale started opening restaurants that can compete with S.F. and NY.
other This place is cleaner than Lee Lee. In addition, there is an authentic Chinese cafe, Chinese BBQ and Chinese bakery inside the supermarket and their quality is okay. The BBQ session is better than the one in Lee Lee.You can get discount by paying $100 upfront for $110 shopping coupons, that is equivalent to about 10% discount.In addition, this place does sell some luxury food that Lee Lee does not offer.
other i cannot give this place other stars because i went there today at 3:30 and IT WAS CLOSED.  what business closes at 3?  REALLY?  oh phoenix, you're killing me.BUT the food (creative, delicious sandwiches and desserts), speedy service, and reasonable prices really do deserve other stars.  The chicken/asparagus/havarti sandwich almost killed my taste buds with its deliciousness.  i went for carry-out at a peak time (about 12:30) and TOTAL, from joining the 6-person line to walking out the door, I probably spent about 1other minutes there.  very fast service=very happy jenny.i didn't get dessert, but i will be back on a day when i'm feeling either very fit or very depressed.  maybe tomorrow, due to my 3 PM CLOSE TIME funk.  crimeny. :)
other Best Ice cream sandwhich I have ever had
other If you're looking for a good meal with solid service you'll find it here.  The menu has something for everyone, too.  If you like to go out for lunch or brunch, this is a great place to go.  Friendly, fast staff helps make the experience that much better.
other Not very impressed.  Burger was ok, fries Looked great, but mushyTry Smashburger!!  Sooo much better
other Absolutely awful... these guys have NO idea what they are doing!
other Alot of the items is presented neat and fresh. I like how they have fresh spinach and beef cube. Didn't care for the sushi or the mongolian BBQ though. But for $7.9other weekday lunch buffet I think the value, variety and quality is there.
other I had my brows done one month ago.  Heather did an amazing job!  I went back after other weeks for a "no charge" touch up.  I haven't worn brow powder or pencil since, and most importantly my brows look TOTALLY natural.  I give her other stars and would strongly recommend her.  As a matter of fact I am going to go back and have my lips done!
other Great staff without an attitude (which is rare in Scottsdale).  As I was waiting for my party to arrive, I was sitting outside drinking my beer and eating my food.  Without ANY questions and/or hassle, my bill was transferred inside when my party arrived.  Not only that, but our waiter remember exactly what I had and was able to split it without me even asking him to do so.  OK, how great is that?  I am totally sold on the service there an  I will definitely come back.  Very nice unpretentious place.
other Happy hour was hopping today, unlike last week.  Bartender Ryan wasn't there, but no worries, as Stefan was just as able and gracious.  I selected the cab to go with the RF "Big Ass Burger," even though I wanted to try the zin.  Did I choose wrong?  I'll try the zin next time.Since I enjoyed the chile-pistachio bread last week, I asked if I could have the commercially-made burger bun swapped out with the new-recipe chile-pecan bread.  No problem.  Ordered it medium, no pickles.  By the time I had thought to take photos of the burger (I was starving so I dug right in!), the scene was a mess!  From the very first slice, the longhorn cheddar-topped patty crumbled into many pieces- I kept wishing I had a spoon to scoop them up!  No matter, as it was still a wonderful meal- loved the smoked bacon, and the chipotle mayo worked well both as a burger condiment and as a dip for the wonderfully crisp and seasoned fries (see photos).If only there are more happy hour meal selections (only two, excluding the salads) for me to enjoy.  Guess I'll be forced to try the Huckleberry bread pudding with creme anglaise and vanilla bean ice cream next time... woe is me ;)
other So everyone in Old Town has been waiting for a good sports bar forever. When everyone heard Thunder Dan was coming to town the excitement starting buzzing. Well this time Thunder Dan didn't hit this buzzer beater.First off it does get two stars for a reason so lets start there. The atmosphere is great. The venue is super cool and there is tons of tvs. Thats pretty much where it stops. The food isn't great and is relatively slow. I have had a burger, wings, the chicken quesadilla and a couple of other things which didn't impress me. Plus the service was super slow...This kind of reminds me of the Suns-Bulls series super exciting but just misses the mark of greatness. I am sticking with my old faithful two blocks away Zipps.
other Let me tell you about my first crush in Phoenix. It happened to me when I least expected. I was sitting at my small cubicle during my first job. Birthday cake graced the break room practically everyday but today was different. When I walked inside to sing an out of key version of the birthday song to my coworker, I noticed a masterpiece in front of my eyes. A white cake topped with the freshest of fruit and the creamiest of white chocolate morphed into a piece of artwork. One bite into the white cake filled with fresh strawberries and I was in lust. It later turned into love and I've been happy every since. I silently thank the coworker who introduced me to Honey Moon Sweets because I can't imagine life without knowing about this sweet Phoenix treat. Over the years, Honey Moon Sweets has been my go-to bakery for a special occasion. I've purchased the "basic" cake for birthday parties. Let me just note here that a basic cake from Honey Moon Sweets is practically a masterpiece in any other bakery's mind. When planning my sister's baby shower, I knew exactly where to go. I wanted the perfect cake and a work of art to grace the baby shower table. And behold the Honey Moon Sweets baby cake. It was three tiers, blue with rattles, pacifier, building blocks, a crib, a teddy bear...you name it filling the top. Some of the pieces were frosting creations and some were real toys. It was almost too gorgeous to eat, but we couldn't resist it so enjoyed every bite. It was just as good as it looked if not better. Honey Moon Sweets does a fabulous job of using the freshest of ingredients and you can tell upon the first bite. The scariest part of this cake adventure was the travel time from the bakery to the Biltmore for the baby shower. One wrong move and the cake would have been toast so be prepared to move lightly with this cake in hand. As you can imagine, cakes from Honey Moon Sweets are not budget-friendly, but for what you get from the cake, it's reasonably priced. Just save your coins for a special occasion because it's worth it. I promise.
other I've gotta say, Nordy's (as my aunt refers to Nordstom since it's her favorite department store ever) is always a safe bet if you're looking for quality selection, customer service, and a very pleasant shopping experience.  Whether you're looking for shoes, lingerie, cosmetics, apparel, etc... you'll likely find it at Nordy's.I'll have to take Samantha O's and Julia T's advice and remember to go to Nordstom's next time I need a new bra.In the meantime, I've gotten lucky with shoes, all kinds of clothes, accessories, and perfume.  This weekend is a big sale.  I ran in earlier to return something and walked out with a new pair of shoes.  Oops.  Take that as a warning, Nordstrom can be dangerous for shop-a-holics.The only times I have not gotten lucky at Nordstrom are when I've been on a mission for something specific - such as Converse Sneakers in Jared's size 7 or a certain shirt or bathing suit in my size.  But I'll overlook these times and return again and again... Keep up the good customer service and selection, Nordy's - and I'll be a customer for life.
other I went here for dinner last night with a group and we had excellent service. The specialty drinks were yummy and were a deal! My favorite (out of two I had tried) was the ketel-one pineapple martini! My sister had a house salad, the dressing tasted homemade, and the croutons were nice and crunchy! I had the Positano Steak Sandwich which was great, my only complaint it was a little too salty, and the fries (and I love fries) were tasty! Other people had the lasagna and they loved it. My sister had the baby back ribs and loved them. If you're looking for a pub-like restaurant that has good prices, pretty tasty food (with a good variety of items on the menu), and excellent cocktails, Keegan's is your place!
3 Expect to pay $10-1other for a decent burger and fries in a tacky, blue-themed interior in cafeteria-style tables and seats.The happy hours isn't bad, as it boasts some reasonable and fun appetizers along with $2.50 IPA drafts, among other options.The service was decent, but not great, and the ambiance as a whole didn't seem to be worth the prices on the dinner menu.  At least, I can think of several better options.
3 I can understand why everyone loves this place-- who wouldn't, right? With so many choices of cool, creamy gelato? Well, unless I am just very unlucky and visited on a bad day, this Gelato Spot has gone steeply downhill. My husband ordered a strawberry-kiwi flavored and I chocolate peanut butter. We both agreed: the gelato tasted grainy, with noticable ice crystals. And worse, the flavorings tasted like they came from a bottle, not fresh. IMO, this has become more of a place to see-and-be-seen -- not savor good gelato!
other Excellent. Fresh and yummy!
3 i know they're doing their jobs and i can understand that. but we couldn't shake our saleslady. we finally had to say that if she didn't leave us alone, we were going to leave. we absolutely couldn't discuss anything because she was CONSTANTLY THERE! we even said we'll come find you if we need any help. literally any piece we glanced at, touched, or came near, she was on top of us "oh isn't this a great piece. we can set up financing and lock in the sales price, and if you buy 5k worth today with cash, we'll throw in...etc". every single item. they have nice stuff, no question about that. but i know this game. and it's not fun. it makes shopping miserable. and besides, it's too expensive for us. we got 3 of the same, exact pieces (same model, same sku) at pruitts for less than half we would have paid at Ashleys.
other Quick services, a decent selection, and solid customer service.
other My absolute favorite thing about summer in Scottsdale is that restaurants and hotels get SUPER cheap and do every night happy hours. Literally, best Happy Hour in South Scottsdale, by far. I originally wanted to eat at Culinary Drop Out, but the line was long and I was STARVING. Went into Wildfish, because even though I had never eaten there, and was left without my Bible of Yelp, I took a chance since I had eaten at its North Scottsdale, Big Brother location, Eddie V's, dozens of times. The menu is very similar to Eddie V's, but I would say, a bit trendier. Me and my man had appetizers and I had a $other Mojito, and it was delicious. I had ahi tuna tar tar, a green salad with shrimp, shrimp cocktail, and by far, the best calamari I had ever had. It was like, salty, sweet, crunchy, and had cashews on it. I couldn't tell if I was eating calamari, or a dessert! Go for Happy hour FOR SURE. Great atmosphere, too...
other This is a really cute Greek restaurant located in an obscure building.  You'd never know from the exterior that a great Greek restaurant is hiding inside.  The place has a family owned restaurant feeling to it, and you'll find all the Greek classics on the menu.The menu is pretty extensive, and a lot bigger than many of the other Greek restaurants I've been to.  They have gyros, sandwiches, pitas, plates, appetizers- but my favorite is the hummus appetizer and the falafel plate.  They're both soooo good.  They also make a pretty mean spanakopita.  For dessert, get the home-made baklava- you'll be very glad you did.
other Seriously, their happy hour prices can't be beat.  A beer, a spicy tuna roll, calamari and avocado egg roll for under $20 including tip.  Service was attentive and friendly.  We had to lurk around the bar area for awhile to get a table, but that only speaks to how popular this place is.  If you are looking for an inexpensive dinner out that doesn't involve Denny's or Olive Garden this is a great choice.
other DECEMBER 2012:They still have the ANGRY WHOPPER!!!!!Best whopper EVER.Mine goes no lettuce, heavy onion, heavy tomato, and BBQ sauce on the bottom bun.It's THICK.5other year anniversary --- second whopper 5other cents!DEAL!!!Really, have you ever had a BAD whopper? :)
other "Fake" (or rather condescending) service from the "Service Manager"...and he didn't even acknowledge me when I asked the status of my car (uh, more like IGNORE). Ended every sentence with an impolite "No ma'am" or "Yes, ma'am"... ya get the scenario. Basically, the guy was a real JERK.They couldn't even figure out HOW to fix my car, even when I TOLD them what was wrong with it ( had been diagnosed at the Dealership). Two guys were sitting there staring at the computer (as if it was going to magically speak to them). At least they didn't charge me, but what a waste of time waiting for 90 minutes....
other We were here on Wednesday, 12/21/11. We had been at a Rubios in CA recently and was extremely disappointed. Not this time!Jacob was our order taker and was VERY courteous and professional. My husband got two fish tacos that were a good size and yummie. I went with the grilled veggie burrito and man, it was huge and tasty!This is what Rubios is about!
other We had a great first visit here for brunch.  They have a creative brunch menu with traditional breakfast items with a twist, lunch items, and great-sounding desserts.  Our party had the sunflower salad, bacon and eggs, steak and eggs, the hummus platter, and the sweet potato chips.  Everything was quite good and very fresh.  We really enjoyed the sweet potato chips - not greasy at all, just sweet potato flavor with a hint of seasoning.  We'll be back to try some of the other menu items.  Great atmosphere and pretty small dining room which makes it quaint and cozy.  Unfortunately we had the table right next to the kitchen doors which was the only unpleasant part.  Bussers and waiters would come flying out of the kitchen and then stand inches away from me with load trays of food trying to figure out what table they were going to.  The water refiller seemed especially hungover as he literally stood next to my arm for 3 minutes trying to figure out who needed water.  They should put a divider between that table and the kitchen.  Also bar service was slow - 1other minute wait for other mimosas.  Waiter apologized but still...overall a good experience.  Big fan of the atmosphere and menu.  Can step up the service a bit.
other I really wasn't impressed with the service or the food.
3 If I hadn't recently found Yogurtland in Scottsdale I would be raving about this place. Unfortunately it is  4other cents an ounce and the other place is 30 cents. Both have a nice variety of flavors but this place is missing the water cooler. You do get a bit sticky from eating your treat. There is something they have that yogurtland doesn't have. They have marshmallow and peanut butter in squeeze containers which is to die for!!
other They close earlier than most large book retailers, 10pm ... Major bummer for those who like to hit up a bookstore late at night instead if the club! Lol. It seems I usually can't find what I want at this particular location. It's in my area or I'd probably pass on it altogether. This review is location specific. I do love bookstores in general...
other I've been a CVS guy for about 1other years, spanning three cities across the country. Some branches are better than others, some regions are better than others - they're no better or worse than other national chains which also have some good branches and some bad branches. I picked them because they have a great "rewards program" and because they have heavy presences in places where I travel often.So this is a bad branch. There's a couple decent check-out kids, but in general their employees are among the worst trained I've ever seen, in terms of providing polite, timely, friendly customer service. They avoid your eyes when they see you looking for something in an aisle, lest you bother them with a question. They never EVER greet you with a smile and a "good morning" or a "did you find everything you need?" while you check out. They have inconsistent policies about whether or not coupons can be scanned from iPhone or paper copies needed (the manager basically called me a liar when I said checkout people have scanned my iPhone coupons many times in the past).I guess if you sell very profitable liquor and meds, you make money no matter how bad your attitude is. It's not like Walgreens and Rite Aid are setting the world on fire with their customer service either....If you don't travel a lot like I do, pick a nice local independent pharmacist...
other I've been for lunch half a dozen times and usually sit at the bar.  Their beers are great.  I'm a home brewer and am pretty discerning in my beer tastes.  Their HopKnot IPA has a huge nose of hops if you are a hop lover--which I am.  However the 8th Street Pale is probably my favorite.  It is a great balanced English style pale ale--without the bitter edge of an American pale ale like SN.  On a hot day their Kolsch is super refreshing and reminds me of being in Germany.  I've had mostly burgers and fries there and they are good.  The atmosphere is casual and the staff is friendly and attentive.  If you are a craft beer lover it is a nice laid back destination to enjoy a brew...or two.  They also pour growlers and sell cans of Kolsch and Kiltlifter in 1other packs.
3 Wanting to purge my guilt for constantly demanding one of my suburban friends to come downtown whenever we go out, I recently dragged another CenPho friend out to suburbia so we could pay him a visit in his homeland for once. San Tan Brewery was our chosen destination.Will I ever come out here again? No, unless guilt once again consumes me.  Would I come back if I lived in Chandler? Sure. (What choice would I have?) The food (an Aegean Stuffed Burger with fries) was good. The beer was even better. The service was annoyingly slow due either to understaffing or inattentiveness. The crowd was large and the place was packed when we arrived around 9:30, but at 11:30 (on a Friday night) it completely cleared out.
other Nice , big, clean, and lots to chose from. This place has a very nice SCUBA section, and that is hard to find in  the desert. I purchased a gift card for a friend and that is why I showed up. Lots of good stuff and a wonderful staff. I live by Dicks so that is where I usually go, but if in the neighborhood I would hit them up.
other Been here twice and enjoyed both of our experiences. The setting is pretty urban feeling for far east Mesa--grateful for that. The wine list is pretty unusual...lots of wines and grapes you've never heard of since the owner is from...Hungary? Can't remember, but the wine selection benefits from his extensive knowledge of that region. The fried chicken--patented, no less--was really something. Spicy and brined to fall off the bone. The pasta dishes are good as well, with portions expected in a urban restaurant (don't expect Claim Jumper portions). All in all a great place to sit, savor dinner and talk. Waitstaff is on a learning curve, and you benefit, since the restaurant is new and they bend over backwards, service-wise. Highly recommended!
3 Good Chinese food, great value -- especially for lunch.  China Village is one of my regular haunts for Chinese food when I'm in the neighborhood.  The building may look run-down, but the food and service are good.
3 I have a love/hate relationship with Costco. I love to support local businesses, but this is one of a couple of exceptions I make.  It seems they treat their employees fairly as most of the employees at this store seem to have been there for years if not a decade. One thing that gives me comfort in my purchasing is they have a terrific return policy and take about anything back.
other Ok folks, I usually am not a scottsdale girl.  I usually enjoy a dive bar at happy hour or my parents house (love you mom and dad!) But I have to say I had a blast here!! I was there to help with a Jon Ric Fashion Show and had the time of my life.  Our server was so cute! she was always right there to make sure we had ice, our bottle, and mixers.  Plus I don't remember seeing a dirty glass EVER at our table! I'm a server and that is not easy to do.  So good job staff.  The dancers were great and the music was so varied! there really was something for everyone.  I would go back again in a heart beat!
other This is my FAVORITE place to dine out in the greater Phoenix area. The food (I recommend the steaks) is almost as good as the view and the service is impeccable. My boyfriend took me here on a date a year ago, and it was definitely one of the most romantic restaurants we have found in Phoenix yet. The prices are a little high ($2other - $40 per entree), but it's well worth it and you won't leave disappointed. If you like American or French food (who doesn't?) and have a special occasion or just feel like doing something different, I highly recommend Different Pointe of View to everyone!
other The democratic party of Arizona consists of a nice group of  people. I visited their office several years ago with some questions and they were quite helpful.
other Next Door Realty is fantastic!  Daradee Murray handled the short sale of my home recently and the entire transaction went unbelievably smooth.  From start to finish she was an excellent communicator.  She took all of our concerns into account and made the process a breeze for us.  I would highly recommend Next Door to anyone looking to buy or sell a home.  The personal attention you receive is unparalleled!
3 It is a salad bar.
3 Super fast service of OK-tasting subs. I've definitely had better, so the signs hanging all over the place that claim that they're "gourmet" is definitely a bit of marketing puffery. Yes, it's gourmet compared to....actually, I think Subway makes a better sub, so I can't really compare it to being more gourmet than anything really. Maybe it's gourmet because they put a ton of sprouts (and lettuce) in the sub? I will give the place props for the very speedy service. I ordered my sub and it was handed to me within other minute. Another thing I noticed about the place was that it was filled with male patrons. If you're a single lady looking for a manly man, come to Jimmy John's.
other We love this place. We got Miss V washed up with the highest package with an extra leave-in conditioner for her super shedding coat AND she got some hand baked peanut butter doggie treats (all for $22). SO worth it. Plus: all the employees are SO nice! And now that they are starting to carry her dog food (Blue Buffalo), we'll be headed to Wag N' Wash for her chow too.  LOVE.
other At first I was disappointed with Padre's menu.  I usually get tacos, rice, and beans, and they only had soft tacos.  But then I ventured out and got this amazing beef burrito that came with rice and beans.  Really glad I tried it.I was also pleased to see that they had Sol beer on the menu.  It is my favorite Mexican cerveza, and I usually can't find it in restaurants.
other Fantastic venue! The bartenders are nice- the drinks are excellent. The lounge is an amazing place to hang out (best downtown spot?!) even if you aren't going to the show! Cool free shows in the lounge! Now let's talk about the main reason you would go there- THE MUSIC! And the venue itself is awesome! The sound is great! The ROOM IS GREAT! It was designed by someone who knew what concert goers want- an intimate experience with fantastic sound. And so if you have the curse of ALWAYS standing behind the TALLEST DUDES EVER at shows- you can now take advantage of the bleacher seating in the back of the room or benches on the side. THERE IS NOT A BAD SEAT IN THE HOUSE! What is left to say ? GET THERE!
3 This is a quick grab some decent food kind of place.. this is not by any stretch 'THE' place to go for Thai-  It's best for lunch specials... expensive-ish for dinner for what it is.  It's fine.  We go for lunch because they are AMAZINGLY fast (insert premade everything), but when we get tired of the same 'ol same 'ol we head to Thai Hut.  We have had some instances of meals being too hot/spicy for our table, so be sure you mean spicy when you order a spicy dish.
3 Coffee is pretty good, but, well, I wasn't thrilled with the ambiance, or the barista. The first time I went, they were having a shift change and forgot to make our drinks. The second, the Batista was kinda brusque. Also, I agree with H C's comments... I walked in and everyone stopped and stared...not great ambiance,but good coffee.
other On a cold winter day, the craving for hot comfort in a bowl makes a person do strange things. It found me driving to a kind of shady part of Mesa, while braving the cold winds in search of a perfect bowl of phò.My new holy grail of Vietnamese restaurants is Phú Thành, located in a rundown strip mall on Southern and Extension. A good Vietnamese restaurant is usually kind of old, slightly dingy and super cheap, and in this case all the basics were met and exceeded.Phú Thành is a no-frills kind of place. Inside it screams for a makeover. Though clearly from another era, it is clean and functional. The service is friendly and the kitchen is fast.There might be a slight familiarity here the owners of Phú Thành and my favorite central Vietnamese joint Da Vàng are brothers. The menus of the two places are almost identical, and they offer a lot.The No. 50 Chà Giò ($2) is what good Vietnamese cooking is all about. Two golden-brown, crunchy egg rolls filled with shrimp and pork are hands on and interactive. Served with a plate of lettuce leaves and herbs, you wrap the egg roll in lettuce and garnish with mint and cilantro, then dunk them into the house-made n?òc châm, a sweet and spicy dipping sauce. The fresh lettuce and herbs cut through the richness of the egg roll, which on its own might be slightly oily.Applying the same hands-on approach, the No. 5other Bánh Xèo ($3.95) replaces the rolls with a pan-fried rice flour crepe. The exterior is slightly crispy, while the soft interior is filled with shrimp and bean sprouts. Of all the Bánh Xèo I've tried, this version is by far my favorite. It's full of flavor and texture.Phó (pronounced like the bad word) is not only fun to say, but fun to eat. Eight versions of the noodle soup are offered, from traditional beef to chicken. Pay attention to the menu description when ordering since you might wind up with unfamiliar cuts of meat.I'm adventurous and love the textures of beef tendon and tripe, so I was in heaven when my steaming bowl of No. other Phò Phú Thành ($4.95) arrived. The broth was incredibly fragrant with clove and star anise. This really should be made into an air freshener.Along with the condiments at the table, the soup comes with a plateful of basil and bean sprouts. But also include limes and chilis to add texture, flavor and depth to your pho experience.For something hearty and comforting, the No. 7 Mì Bò Kho ($4.75) is a bowl of chewy egg noodles filled with a beef stew. Tender pieces of stewed carrots and beef grace the rich and complex flavors of the dark and tasty brew.If you're carbohydrate loading, order a slab of French bread to absorb all of the bone-warming elixir at the bottom of the bowl.For food like this, a little shady is worth the drive.
3 I liked the tiki theme and torch lights in the patio area. During the past few times that I came here, it was normally packed inside and I always ended up finding a seat outside. Since it was packed the last time I came, getting drinks took a while, but it wasn't too bad. Drinks were cheap and not stingy compared to CA. Music was not the typical main stream songs that you hear on the radio, which wasn't my favorite and the crowd consisted of older professionals. Definitely not a dress up type of lounge, everyone was dressed casually.
other Haven't been to a Vietnamese restaurant since I left Colorado, almost three years ago. But for what it's worth, this is the best, most authentic Vietnamese cuisine I've had so far. =)
3 Average sushi but lots of fun.  I love just taking things off the conveyer belt.  Alcohol is also a bit pricey.
other OK, being from Wisconsin (the land of the "great lakes") I was COMPLETELY surprised to be told that, yes, there are lakes here in the desert of Arizona.  The Lake, Saguaro Lake, is a man made lake originally built as Stewart Mountain Dam...even so, its beauty is equal to those you would see in the glacier regions of the Midwest.  I was amazed, frankly, at how beautiful this tour was.  Sold for $18 for 90 minutes, you get your money's worth.  But that is probably not what you want to hear...The "event" is a combination of 1) the scenery, and also 2) the charm of the paddle boat itself.  The boat is quite large with seating for probably close to 7other people!  It's an event that you could share with family, but I happened to be there with friends.  Currently, it's a pretty mellow type of event (great for Mother's Day!), although I am told that they are hoping to exploit its benefits to include comedy shows, Jazz ensembles, stargazing, and a variety of other events.P.S.  They also advertise that you can rent the paddle boat for company picnics, weddings, and the like.
other I went there for happy hour.  The chips and salsa were good.  I was a little disappointed in the service.  We had to ask for everything.  I sat there with an empty glass for quite some time.  The bartender could have been having an off night so I will give them a try again.
other Delicious barbecue, we had other meats platter that we split with three people.  The pulled chicken is amazing, the brisket tender and juicy, the ribs succulent and flavorful, best barbecue around.  The sides were delicious as well, mac & cheese was great, mashed potatoes did not disappoint, ranch beans aren't anything special but they tasted good.  Service was great, waiter was attentive to our needs and accommodated a last minute switch after already putting in the order. Atmosphere is good, not too noisy/quiet, the lighting could be improved though, a single bulb above the table barely allows you to see what you are eating, though the food wasn't there long enough to be seen:)Highly recommended to someone looking for great barbecue ribs, chicken, brisket, etc.
other I was inspired to visit Casella's after a coworker told me about their authentically Italian goodness. As my tummy growled today, I was in the neighborhood so I knew just where to go. I walked into a simple yet clean deli. Immediately, I was welcomed by the entire staff (I believe they are all related or at least family through friendship). They asked me if it was my first time in and I said yes, so right away they started giving me a history of the shop and the tasty cuisine. Celebrating their 33rd anniversary (congrats!!), I learned that everything is homemade -- from the meatballs to the chicken salad. The owner said he goes through 40 lbs of chicken a week. He gave me a sample and the chicken was chunky and delicious. I'm not surprised he has to prepare so much chicken every week! The meatballs and freshly cut meat for Philly Cheese-steak sandwiches looked great too! The owner mentioned he is from Philly so better be ready for some authentic Philly and Italian style cookin'! While I was there, the owner was slicing some fresh provolone, so I added that to the warmed turkey sandwich I ordered. The turkey was tasty, the provolone was yummy and the sourdough roll tasted like it was fresh from the oven. It was $8 for a sandwich and soda but the sandwich was hefty enough that I saved half for later. As I walked out, everyone said goodbye to me and I felt like I was leaving a family dinner. In summary, here's what made Casella's stand out: - The very friendly staff- It's a local family-owned neighborhood deli celebrating their 33rd anniversary. Gotta support the local businesses! - Clean decor - Tasty, homemade food that's on display for visitors to see - A good family-style atmosphere that greets you the second you walk inside. I'm not sure how it's taken my so long to find this local treat, but now that I've found it, I plan on becoming a regular. Directions: Note that this is hidden in the Basha's strip mall (on the side of Granite Reef) but don't let that fool you!
other the promise of homemade turkey and roast beef drew me in, much to my dismay it's shredded. As Ramsey would say 'like a dog's dinner!'. I got the bobby with roast beef, so i could taste both. The bread was good, the stuffing was cold. The meat was chokingly dry. Dry dry. Sawdust tasting. I'm sure the other non shredded meats are great on that bread, this might as well had just been the stuffing and cranberries on the bread. Plus, the manager was bragging about how he just stands around and does nothing but micro manage. Donkeys! Lol. Make that guy clean the bathrooms!
other Awesome bartender on the patio! Way great drink specials!! Don't come here to have conversations, folks. It's LOUD!! Great DJ spinning crazy dance music. Place gets way crowded so get there early and snag a spot to people watch!!
other Had a fun UYE get-together with Brian S. & Norm R. today to give this little Venezuelan cafe a try.  I had a Carne Esmechada Patacon, which is a sandwich with slices of plantain for the top & bottom, fried crisp.  (A plantain is something like a huge banana.)  Inside was a moderate amount of shredded beef & some other things.  It was good, but it cost $6, & for a full-sized meal you would have to add a couple of other things in the $other range, & end up at about $1other for your lunch!For half the price, I would give it twice as many Stars.
other This address is for the one next to Panda Express, not the one in Walmart.This place sucks and it doesnt even come close to any other McDonalds. How in the world can you have so many employees working and have a line of people waiting for their food? It's like there is retarded people working there and they all have special needs. This one guys was just waiting for a happy meal and had been waiting for 10 minutes before I even got there. It them about 1other minutes for them to give me my food. One mexican kid that was working was to busy flirting with this girl in front of everyone, while her father was asking why the food was taking so long to make. The dining area was dirty after I got my food and sat down. They should fire the manager and everyone that works there. They take no pride in working there and its sad to see this. It shouldnt matter what they are being paid to be there, its still a job and they ARE being paid to be there. I will NOT be returning to this place.......
other Very friendly but need to work on the bathroom
3 Friendly reps, painfully high tire price quote.  Found em for $100 less, per tire while waiting for my car to be pulled up.
other One of our favorite restaurants in the Valley! We go here about once a month. Some of my favorite dishes are the whole fish, salt and pepper shrimp, Pho with everything in it, Spring rolls, Shrimp/Pork over rice noodles, and the Seafood over soft egg noodles. We also have the Vietnamese coffee as our dessert! YUM!
other Dr. Koch and his staff are wonderful! I know that I am in great hands and being given the best care possible. They do a great job at working you in to the schedule if you have a last minute pain that needs some extra attention. I would highly reccomend Arizona Chiropractic to anyone!?
other I had such a nice experience here - Classic Chicken - the first time that I really wanted to go back. Second time, onion strings were so greasy I couldn't eat them, burger was okay. Third time, yesterday? Enough to say we wont go back. Ever. Lovely and I sat in a sticky booth, he ordered 1/3 lb classic, me the bbq grilled chicken - both with a small soda. Soda was disgusting, flat, watery, gross. Upon the lovely's complaint, the bus boy brought him bottled water. I took one bite of my sandwich and was assaulted by hair. Gak. We got up and left our food. Jeff told the manager about the food and the soda, we got our money back with an apology saying they were sorry we 'didn't have a better experience'. Um. A better experience??? Seriously? 1other dollars? Ugh.
other I am so loyal to Durant's that I feel like a heel...but City Hall was divine.  Steaks, sides, drinks...the only thing we didn't have was dessert...but $1100 later, who could afford it?
other This was my first time to Sekong By Night.  I have had Khmer food before, which is ironic, as my wife is from Vietnam, but never had Khmer food from Cambodia.  She has to come to the USA to experience Khmer food!!  I have eaten Khmer food in San Francisco CA, and in Siem Reap.Both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with Sekong By Night.  It looks like a tiny little forgettable restaurant from outside on the street, but once you step inside. you can see the owner put some thought into the decor.  It really looks Asian.  It is as though the owner went on a shopping trip to Phnum Penh and came back with tons of artwork for the place.  The Amok fish is really nice.  Reminded me of a cafe I had dinner at in Siem Reap some 9 years ago when I was seeing Angkor.  The fish was fresh.  My wife wanted to switch with me (she ordered the Katheaw Cha).  The Katheaw Cha is also very good.  I ordered a Coconut Juice as my drink expecting it to be canned.  It was fresh, and smelled fresh (a pleasant surprise!!!)My wife ordered the Grass Jelly drink, and it was also good.  I really wish that this place was in Mesa AZ, as I would go more often.  Maybe so, I will make the drive again to this place from Mesa as appropriate.  This place was a pleasant surprise and I wish the owner great success.  I want this restaurant to succeed.  The only place where the Khmer food was better (for me) was Siem Reap, but then it is perhaps a little unfair to compare a restaurant in the USA to what really is available in Cambodia.
other The best sweet and sour soup ever!  Food is delicious and favorable.  Delivery is pretty good, nice people.
other Disgusting!  Had a Groupon so my daughter and I tried it out.  Very outdated and gaudy 80's style interior made me feel like I was in an episode of Sopranos.  The food itself was pretty bad.  We ordered pretty simple dishes but they just had no flavor at all!  After trying it out I'm positive all the good reviews on here are employees or owners creating them.
other A friend of a friend recommended Lou/Autoplex and I couldn't be happier.  Lou provides honest, fast service and is a pleasure to deal with.  No runaround, no nonsense, honest auto service.  Extremely difficult to find these days... I went to him for a muffler/tailpipe and then later for a catalytic converter and was completely happy with the outcome.  Additionally, he pointed out other things that I should see my previous mechanic about that they needed to fix/finish.  :)
3 This is the place to go in Scottsdale for an Italian beef.  When I visit Chicago I usually go to Al's or Portillo's for Italian beef and having Al's here saves me the trip to the Windy City.The decor here is nice with several motorcycles displayed throughout the restaurant for some reason.  It's neat and clean and plenty of helpful employees provide relatively quick service.I ordered the regular Al's beef with sweet peppers.  I usually don't order my sandwiches "wet" because they come with plenty of juice already.  Good flavor and just the right size.  The fries were thick but a little greasy for my taste.All in all, a good lunch and a place to keep in mind when I'm feeling like a taste of Chicago.
other Decentfood, but horrible service. Both servers walked by me three times while I was sitting inside without acknowledging me at all. I was by myself and felt as though everyone else that came walking in were immediately welcomed.  I wish I would have received the same attention. I was ready to walk out when i was finally approached. Nobody came back to check on me to make sure everything was ok after they delivered my food. Being from Vegas I am not accustomed to such non attentive service staff. I guess that flys here in Scottsdale, but I expected more from the type of clientele that they have. On a positive note, they do have a cozy place that gives the feel of a French coffee shop/bistro. Hopefully this review will be helpfull in giving them insight into making sure that every guest is treated with the same attentiveness to service.
other I'm giving Bobby Q an extra star in this update to my previous review, because although it has its share of hits and misses, it is, in fact, as good as it gets in Phoenix for great barbecue. I love barbecue. It is a hobby of mine. When I get stuck on something and want to know what it should look and taste like, I go to Bobby Q and am almost never disappointed. Most recently, this happened with beef brisket. I'm going to upload a picture I took of Bobby Q's brisket because seriously, if you look at it and don't want to immediately die from desire, then you just don't like barbecue. If I had anything bad at all to say about Bobby Q, it would be that sometimes their meats can be slightly overdone but this is not the norm. Their quality control, considering how much food they must serve to keep up with the demand, is astounding.  Their prices are too high, but of course, you're paying for the almost Disney-esque atmosphere. Their sauce is absolutely delicious (although it should be noted: they don't understand what "spicy" means). All in all I really can't say enough good things about this place. Go look at my brisket photo. Seriously.
other I really love the chicken and how it already comes with pickles o. The sandwich ... Fave.. I also love the buffalo sauce very addicting
other Stopped by one night late, only one guy working, probably the manager/owner based on him being on the phone and looking like he wanted to gtfo dodge attitude and not wearing anything quiznos related like most workers do... Food... subpar... it's a chain... it's hard to fuck up... but he did. There was no care in the making of the sub... I pretty much watched him throw it together, run it through the toaster tossed some lettuce on and wrap it up...I had chips in my hand... wanted a meal... he didn't ask and just rang it up w/o the drink... I asked what size cup to grab and he said "oh you wanted a drink?"  Of course I wanted a fucking drink... I just stared at him like wtf man?  Told him to keep his drink cause he'd have to re run my card...  srsly it's a chain that gives you all the stuff and training to make a sandwich like the other 1000's of quiznos around the country... and you can't do it. If you hate customer service don't buy a franchise sandwich shop.Two stars... lucky it isn't one. I'm out
other realized I rank this a 3, what am I insane??
3 It's true, there is a real bull and a slide. This place has been around forever, I think my parents used to go there back in the 70's. I can't say much about the food since I've only been here for happy hour, which was pretty decent. Their HH  included top shelf for 3 bucks and some cheap beers. They also have appetizers on the HH menu, sliders, quesadillas and potato skins, that sort of stuff.Pretty nice view and going during happy hour you can see all the people sitting in traffic on the 10 and cheers them from the balcony.
3 We visited for the annual Local First Fall Festival. There was no parking available, so we had to go across the street. There were also too many people, so crowding and navigation were problematic. There were a good number of tents offering free samples. It was great to try food from several local places, since we got to discover new places to visit later. Unfortunately, none were selling food, so we couldn't also get lunch on the spot and had to go elsewhere for a full meal. I like this event as a way to try food samples and explore potential places to visit in the future.
other Went to Cracker Barrel twice while vacationing at our home in Litchfield Park.  All the food we ordered were very good and the service was good also.  I highly recommend their pancakes.
other Fun place to get masks for all my robberies.I joke. but really you can get good masks at Easley's.
other Yelpers,  have a question. If menus and prices vary by location, help this CA transplant figure out the best ones to try! Thanks, I've heard such good things about Sonic but have only been to the Anaheim and Hemet, CA ones while visiting.
other I am so not a fan of the dentist.  But Dr. Ito and his staff changed that.  Professional, yet relaxed attitudes.  From the moment you book the appointment to the time you leave you feel like are well cared for and that you aren't just a number or a dollar sign.While in the waiting area I flipped through Dr. Ito's "Smile" book that shows some of his work.  WOW!  He makes teeth look real, not like Chiclets.  He does some fabulous cosmetic work!  I went in to have a crown put on and it was quick and painless. So quick that I didn't get to finish watching the movie!   Each chair has headphones and a flat screen that shows a movie (he keeps a good stock of the latest movies.).  Who'd have thought that going to the dentist would keep me so entertained?I've had to bring my son to each appointment as I haven't had anyone to keep him.  Does that matter? Nope.  Dr. Ito's office is equipped with a children's area in the back where the kids can watch a movie, read a book or play a game.  He thinks of everything.I have been recommending him to everyone I meet.  I can't say enough good things about Dr. Ito and his staff.  You won't regret going to the dentist if Sonoran Hills Dental is your new dental office.
other I have been here multiple times and each time the staff has been superb.  Their selection is also awesome.  I would highly recommend.
other We use yelp.com anytime we are out of town and want a great place to eat. We weren't disappointed again...Ramiro's is great...generous portions, great prices, huge selection...you can even get most everything ala carte. We were visiting my parents and told them about Ramiro's. They said they have driven by many, many times...not any more! I had the biggest, best carnitas chimichanga I have ever seen. Can't wait to come back and have the taco salad. Don't drive by this place!
3 My sis recommend this place for our weekly dinner. We shared on of the large appetizer platters (hummus, baba ganoush, tabouli and dolmades and two pitas). Very good and perfect for a light dinner. I would have to say the best thing was the fresh lemonade...wow! If you like tart you'll love this. I thought overall the service was great. Not only was our waitress extremely attentive but the manager stopped by to make sure we were enjoying our foodI give The Flaming Kabob 3 stars!
other Yoli's has recently been popping up on Yelp's 'Best Of' front page. Many people are mouthing out and as the food whore that I am, I needed to go out and try it for myself.My previous research told me that there were many other stars and 3 stars reviews regarding the ambiance, service and food. It seemed that the place had be 5-stars for a while but trending analysis showed a decline in the late 2011- early 2012. Alright enough nerd talk-  it was a Saturday morning, I was starving and I needed a place to have brunch with my lady friend in town.When it comes to brunch at Yoli's, you really need to leave all your expectations at the door. The neighborhood its in is a little sub-par, the parking situation isn't grand and the interior and patio decor resembles a home that stopped paying for landscaping services a long time ago. The tables outside are all basic basic plastic, they are not squeaky clean (or perfectly leveled) and the seating is pretty limited. If you are coming to Yoli's, you are coming here for the food and nothing else, this ain't no brunch at the Four Seasons.Their menus are strictly breakfast/brunch related but at a 2-sided page list, their breakfast choices do have a large variety of flavors and prices. The food is on the stealthier side with skillet dishes, omelets and diner-style potato sides. My friend and I ordered their most popular dish, the El Monte- Hawaiian french toast sandwich filled with egg whites, turkey, bacon and cheese with a 'spicy orange marmalade'. At about $7, the sandwich was pretty large and filled me up easily after just half of it. The french toast itself was soft and spongy and the bacon had some crisp, but the turkey was very thinly-sliced deli meat so it didn't have a lot of flavor and the spicy marmalade was tasty but not spicy at all.The service was a tad slow but the lady was very very courteous and nice to us, she just didn't stop by very often so we had to wait around for our drinks and our check for quite a while. Overall I wasn't blown away with Yoli's but I would recommend as a place with decent portions and good prices. As of now, a 3.7other stars on my book.I am a big supporter of local restaurants and I love seeing a family-owned business thrive. With a little bit more decor, faster service and a cleaner environment this place can return to be the GEM that people used to talk about. Yoli, if you are reading this- I hope you take this advice, we all want to see you succeed so we hope you can get back on that horse and impress the hell out of us. Good Luck!!
other I met my cousin here for lunch, and we were really happy with the meal.  The place is a less than impressive on the interior, dingy booths, long and narrow.  It's terribly crowded up by the counter, not a lot of room to order and pick up your food.I do question how a place can call itself "Los Taquitos" and then not have taquitos on the menu, but I went for the flautas instead.  They were good, but what set the meal apart were the beans.  The most flavorful beans I have ever had.  If you told me these were magical beans, I would have believed it, but I wouldn't have stopped eating them to plant one and see.Service was quick and friendly and there was plenty of seating, even during the lunch rush.  Looked like a lot of people get orders to go.  I'd like to go back and try a few other items on their menu, if they come with beans of course.
other Recently ordered Spinato's again and just had to update to other stars... as much as I've always loved NYPD, I have to admit that this really is the best pizza I've had in the valley. It's not fair to compare the two, as they're totally different styles, but it's just so good. And they're local. Can't beat it!
other I love their strawberry drink, its not really agua fresca because it's a little on the thicker side, but still tasty.. I've tried their sonoran dog & it wasn't that great. It was too soggy. (Get your ass to Tucson to experience a good sonoran dog). (FYI: El Guero Canelo is amazing!)I've also tried their menudo & carne asada torta. But my favorite is the California Burrito. If your in the area & want Mexican food it's a great place to go.
3 If it would be closer to my area, I could give it one more star. Their special of $other burgers is a good way to call your attention. The best was the service, the lady that took care of us was really friendly and nice. Another time I'll have to try their food.
other Five bucks for a bottle of Miller Lite says pretty much everything you need to know about this place.Also, if you are planning on attending a show here, plan on paying for parking.I have seen some terrible sound guys here, but it's hard to say if that is the fault of the Marquee - a lot of bands that would play here tour with sound people.The majority of the problems here are problems with venues of this size everywhere in the country - the parking, the over-priced shitty beer, the strip-search upon entry, the lack of re-entry.Still, if there was any competition for a venue in that part of the Valley that could handle bands that are as popular as the bands that play at the Marquee, they'd be hard-pressed to do a less-enthusiastic job of it.Also, the sloped floors make it easier to see a band from further away, but they also can KILL your back.
other Great service, I didn't get steak from here (yes, I know...a steakhouse), just got the Zesty Thai Salmon. The salmon was awesome with the chili mayo, baked potato, and asparagus. Can't wait to go back to try their other dishes.Thank you Kathy (owner) for taking the time to send me the name of the dish! Had to update this review and rating because of it :D
other From the outside you wouldn't guess the kind of school it is - its in a strip mall, its small, not very well known - but if you took the chance to come inside and see for yourself you would be very surprised and impressed.  This is by far the best dojo I have ever run across.  You are welcomed when you enter the door, all your questions are asked whether they seem stupid or not. You are treated kindly and with respect from the get go - a very warm place to walk into.  I was so impressed with this place I signed my kids up immediately.  They have so many types of classes and the variety and time schedule they really try and have it work around your family so you have your time as well.  The teachers here are amazing and always do their best to make it the best class you have every time.  I would recommend this dojo to anyone that asks me - and I do.  If you haven't come into this place and tried it or have your kids try it then you should - you are missing out.
other Ohhhh, I like, I like!First of all, if you haven't seen Distrito, scope the photos on the website. High-five to the interior designer. From the gold glittery tables to the gumball wall, this place screams fun, energy, and overall a kick-ass atmosphere.I stayed at the Saguaro for five nights, so I had plenty of time to get my dinner (and breakfast!) on at Distrito. Actually, for dinner, I had room service but Distrito is where it came from. I was absolutely starving after a long plane ride, so I ordered the chicken tacos, guac, and a plantain appetizer, and it only took about 20 minutes to show up. Win.The chicken tacos were really, really good. Little corn tortillas, marinated chicken, slaw, radish, and a perfectly-sized slice of avocado. There were three of them and I could only eat two, but they were so well made. The plantain dish was also impressive, and had some black bean puree underneath that balanced out the sweetness of the plantains. The star of the show, however, was the guacamole. Tons of lime, zing, and flavor. I ate almost all of it and it was definitely worth it. Usually when I have guacamole it's just so-so and I have to add some spice, but this showed up completely perfect.When I had breakfast, things were also on point. They made me an egg white omelet with tons of vegetables inside, and my co-workers seemed to love other menu items like the pancakes and french toast, as well. If I lived in Scottsdale I'd definitely visit this place a time or two more. Consider me a fan!
other WOW.  This places is incredible.  I can honestly say that everything on the menu is wonderful.  It's the perfect date place, since you can order booze to cure the date jitters.  Also, you can satisfy your dieting girlfriend and still order a big plate of "man food".  The best part about their menu is the fact that it is SO TASTY with being HEALTHY.  The extra care in picking ingredients, grilling/cooking with little fats, and unique spice combinations truly makes PJ stand out.  The decor's nod to local artists also helps make the dining room an enjoyable place to be.  For a perfect healthy and satisfying vegetarian lunch I recommend the following:  A small Greek salad with an order of the jalapeño or roasted red pepper hummus (PS:  they'll let you order the hummus half and half!)
other The service at this location was great, until one of the servers managed to incorporate throwing up in into a conversation while I was nursing a hangover. Never a good idea to talk throwing up to a customer that is eating.duh!! This conversation led to more inappropriate words from the employee until he finally left....grrrrr!!!Had the biscuits& gravy special ( $10.9other ), no bueno. I like my gravy simple...just some gravy with a little sausage running through,thats it. Can't stand it when there is onions, peppers, celery, carrot...yuck!! And they served those generic potatoes that are big flavorless cubes that they put in the deep fryer. Should have just had the chicken and waffle, lesson learned.
other Cin Cin pronounced CHIN CHIN which means cheers in Italian!  This is a great little bistro type lounge. It is a posh little lounge with unique little decorations and a small patio great for small groups.The food here is excellent the service is good and this place is never real busy so it is a nice place to enjoy a quick bite before you do the club scene so you don't get extremely wasted on an empty stomach, a great little starter place for you and some friends.The location is great too, right across from the W and and down the street from Axis N Radius, Suede, and PCL. This is definitely a good spot to meet at for before binge drinking in old town. I got a bottle of Pelgrino water and the stuff portabello mushroom, with the vinaigrette spinach. This was excellent probably one of the better portabello mushroom meals I have eaten around the valley.
other Hey Guys, This place is awesome....but I could be jaded because of all the wonderful wines I sampled! From the gris, cabs, sparkling shiraz, riesling to the chardonnay, this shop had what we were looking for and what we weren't looking for! The atmosphere was amazing and quiet for a Thursday night get together. Our hostess was sweet and doted to our every need. The food was amazing. I completely recommend the crocodile pot stickers. For exotic wines and exotic meats appetizers, look up Down Under Wines!
other I got the best KEEN hiking boots on sale here and they have a great selection of dog frisbee and dog boots and dog toys. I like this location, nobody bothers me and I can mill around without anyone bothering me.
other You want to go to Four Peaks. Trust me.
other It does not get much better than this, fellas.BS West is hands down the best gay bar in Phoenix.Friendly bartenders, cheap drinks, good-looking crowd, great music..it's definitely got it all.Best night to check out is the obvious 2-4-other Wednesday. Thursdays and Sundays can also be fun if you're into karaoke. Saturdays are a nice alternative if you don't really dig Forbidden or Amsterdam, it's a different crowd.It definitely has a "Cheers" feeling to it... not pretentious whatsoever. Great patios too, especially the back one with the new video screen they installed.Oh, and their Halloween bash is THE party to be at. 3,000 people attended in 2007.
other We were gifted a Groupon for Fuego and had the pleasure of dining there on Friday night. We did not have a reservation, which would have helped us sit outside, but we were seated inside right away. The host was very pleasant and welcoming. Much has already been praised about this little gem, and I agree with all of the accolades regarding the atmosphere, the service, the food...it was all wonderful. We had the Fuego salad, which was huge and lovely (although I would have liked some diced onions on it; maybe I'll ask next time), the tortilla soup (husband raved about this), the Pulled Pork with cheddar chipotle mashed potatoes and maple-glazed carrots, and the panko-breaded chicken breast with creamed jalapeno corn and maple-glazed carrots. In all it was delectable. The entrees were succulent and nicely plated. I particularly loved the creamed corn, which was perfectly spicy and helped clear by sinuses (I succumbed to a bad cold the next day, so maybe I need some more!).The only thing I would not order again is the carrots. I didn't feel these added anything to our dinners. The maple taste was pretty subtle, to the point of being nonexistent. Also, I think that if you're going to put yourself out there as an upscale restaurant, go the extra mile and use real carrots instead of the bagged "baby carrots" that you can find so readily on cafeteria lines. It will look better. Our waiter forgot to charge us for the soup. I pointed this out, and he comped us anyway. I will definitely continue to patronize an establishment that empowers its staff to make decisions like that without worrying that they're going to get a dock in pay.We'll be back, probably first to try out the amazing-looking Happy Hour!
other Happy Hour Review.We stopped by to try the much ballyhooed Happy Hour and were were pretty damn underwhelmed.    First of all, I guess I'm failing to see what's so happy about a $6.00 spicy tuna roll and $8.00 drink.  Secondly, like other non-japanese sushi joints in this town (cough, cough Ra Sushi), this is sushi for people who don't really like sushi.  Thirdly, seriously attitudinous staff, but one look at the uber-douchy clientele explains that.  Pass.
other So, this will not be my best review, especially when I expected so much more from this place.Lets get this out of the way and on the table first, this ws not a bad place to go, but, it wasnt my favorite by any means.  I went in expecting to pay a lot for the meal, and rightfully expected the best food I have ever had, and that was just NOT the case.  From the high prices to the limited menu, I would expect this place to specialize in the particular menu items, and would hope to have my taste buds dancing while I shout for more.  I didnt.We started the meal with burratta forno cotto mozzarella.  it consists of oven baked burrata mozzarella served with grilled ciabatta, fried eggplant, lemon-truffle vinaigrette and parsley.  There were only two tiny ciabatta slices which was not the first complaint.  the second complaint would be that the fried eggplant could have used a bit more flavor.  (perhaps a little lemon pepper in the batter would have done some good) Lastly, the dish could have satisfied by just having a bit more cheese.  This dish was not bad by any means, just expected a bit more with the $1other price of two miniature slices of ciabatta and two thinly sliced pieces of eggplant.on to the salad.  I dont know about you, but, when I order a salad, I expect a salad.  this was a salad, just not with any lettuce or salad look.  we ordered the caprese di pomodoro.  this dish is made with heirloom tomatoes, preserved lemon, herbs, fresh burrata mozzarella and extra virgin olive oil.  from the description, i assumed, dont ever assume, that this was going to have some spring mix as a salad base, then have the tomatoes witih cheese and basil, and then the lemon with olive oil as a dressing.  WRONG.  it was nothing more than what the description said.  it was two tomatoes cut in half, with a small amount of cheese and a few basil leaves and then the lemon preserve mixed with the olive oil on top.  dont get me wrong, this ws absolutely AMAZING, and I would love to have it again.  It is just not what I expected, so, it would have been nice to know what exactly I was ordering for $10.To make matters worse, our so called salad took about 30 minutes to make its way to the table after putting in the order.  it took so long that the chef actually apologized and told management that he was going to send out a soup for us for the wait.  we were fine and in no rush, but, when we were already having our food take forever and told we were going to get soup, we expected it.  the soup never came.finally, after waiting for and hour and a half for our main entree, we got our food.  it was good, but, nothing to write home about.  my pollo portofino was bland to say the least, and was actually a little dry.  the potatoes were decent, but again, a bit bland.my date got the ravioli di mozzarella con salsa all'arrabbiata.  the ravioli pasta was so thick that you really couldnt taste the filling, and the sauce was to sweet in my and my date's opinion.we however did order a side of the risotto parmigiano, and this was just amazing.  I am very happy that the recipe was on a poast card that came with the bill.  I will be making this at home in the coming week.for dessert, we ordered pistachio gelato.  it was the best gelato I have ever had.when it comes to a decision of returning to Alto, it will not be high on my list due to being over priced for what you get and all around, just not the best first experience.  I will however think of stopping in to get some risotto or gelato to go.when it comes to good Italian, I think I will be sticking with Italian Gratto or Pane e Vino.
other Been wanting to try this place out for some time and finally had the opportunity today.  I didn't expect much of a crowd on a Friday morning, however when we pulled in I was shocked to see about 10 people waiting outside.  Typical for a weekend morning breakfast joint.....but a weekday?  This place must be good.  Suprisingly, the wait was short...they obviously know how to handle a crowd at this place.  Once inside, I was impressed.  Pretty small, but we had plenty of room in our booth.  I ordered the eggs and sausage, which came with toast and potatoes. The food came out quick.  The thing that really set it apart was the meat.... this was no Jimmy Dean.  It was worthy of Abe Frohman, Sausage King of Chicago.  Needless to say, I'm looking forward to going back and trying some more items on the menu.
other This place is super darling. That's right, super. I've only been once and it was to quickly grab some cookies to curb a serious pastry craving. I had never heard of Churn and found them via good old Yelp. I snagged a Chocolate Chocolate Chip cookie and another fabulous cookie that sadly enough I can't remember exactly. It had cranberries and it was heavenly. I love how they have old school candy displayed through out the store! Good to know for when I'm buying goodies for events or holidays. Their ice cream selection is killer and I will be making a special trip out there one of these smoking hot days to enjoy some!
3 Finally tried Sucker Punch Sally's today and I think it has promise.  They are still on the small opening menu so the lunch choices were limited but I had the pork tenderloin sandwich and must say I was impressed.  Obviously made in house and not frozen, nice sized portion and very tasty, almost like a German schnitzel.  The fries were so-so, I don't care much for fresh cut fries as they are usually limp like these were.  Will definitely give them another try for breakfast and when they get the full menu going in a few weeks.  Nice vibe and the waitress was very friendly.  If you live in the area and have been thinking about it, give them a try.
other This place is great!   I've eaten here twice now and both times the food has been wonderful.  I've driven by this place for years and it always looked closed to me.   The windows are very dark.   My husband's barber told him his customers (the barber's) drive all the way from Scottsdale to eat here.    We decided to try it out after hearing this and reading good reviews about it on Yelp.   The first time we went for dinner.  I had the Osso Bucco and my husband had Seafood Paella.   Both were great.  I've had  Osso Bucco in high end restaurants that couldn't compare to this.   The second time we ate here for lunch.   Husband had the Philly Cheesesteak with Peppers, Onions, and Mushrooms.  I had the spaghetti and meatballs.   I had some of his sandwich and we both agreed it was the best Cheesteak we've ever had.  The sandwiches are loaded with fillings and are not salty.   Spaghetti and Meatballs were good but I like Babbo's and Humble Pie's better.    I would have given it five stars but the atmosphere is not the best.   Our first waiter even told us they do have the reputation for being a hole in the wall.   The service is very casual with no sense of urgency.  On our second visit for lunch our waitress told us she had been there over five years and they have quite a few regulars.    Both times we have visited the restaurant was almost full.    Try this place out even though it is a "hole in the wall."
other Food--The fire roasted garlic tomato soup is excellent.  They sprinkle tortilla chips for garnish over a tiny dollop of sour cream.  Mmmmm.  Yummy.  The mixed green salad with albacore tuna is also a delightful choice, as is the turkey wrap and CA Chicken sandwich with pesto mayo.  Drip coffee and espresso drinks are good, too.  Overall, everything tastes great because it's made fresh.  No pre-packaged items here.Seating--Lots of booths and tables inside and out.  They have a cozy little set up with what looks to be 'lounge' chairs that accommodates 6 with swivel tables perfect, for savoring your beverage of choice.  The rest of the dining area looks like it has capacity for about 100 people, if all seats were filled despite a placard declaring the maximum capacity is '311'.Peak times--avoid lunchtime during the weekdays.  It would appear that all of Surprise is feenin for a sandwich or soup/salad special from PB during 11-1PM.  The lines are long and you can forget about getting back to work in under an hour if you factor in commute time, food prep & consumption.  IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.  The only time service has been 'fast' is during breakfast.  I've been there for a breakfast networking event and on a Saturday.  During these times, I received my order promptly and had little trouble locating a table.Free stuff--this would include WiFi, bread samples with tasty spreads, muffin and/or cookie bits.  Bonus points for free stuff!PB is open Mon-Sat 7AM-9PM and Sun 7AM-6PM.
other I've been here twice for lunch. It's okay but I won't be coming back. The portions are small. I had one of the curries and it was good. But I had the pad thai which the menu said contains chicken and shrimp. Not a single shrimp on the plate. Cheap bastards. One of the lower quality Thai restaurants I've been to in Phoenix next to Thai Hut.
other Sadly, I'm giving this place one star and an explanation why it is only getting one star.  The Manger/operator guy.Sure, the food here isn't all that bad.  Probably a half a notch or so higher than most of the hot slop fast food you can get for lunch.  Most of the crew members are pretty attentive, don't seem to be meth addicted, and I see them cleaning the tables on a regular basis.  Looks like the crew changes over quite often, and I know why.My beef is not with the crew members, oh no.  Not with the food or cleanliness of the store.  Nope.  The Manager guy, the guy who looks like a real pussy version of John Leguizamo.  This guy ruins about every trip I have to this joint.  That is my problem with this joint.  Elaboration will proceed now.This guy is without a doubt one of the biggest assholes I have ever encountered in the fast food industry.  Actually, one of the biggest assholes period.  What a douche bag.  Seems like any time I have a coupon, this guy will literally butt in the middle of the order, give me a ration of shit and do about anything possible not to use it.  Seriously, what is it, 30 cents?  I had a store coupon that was on a tray liner a while ago and this nutsack got in the middle of the order, cancelled it and refused to let the coupon be used.  I asked why and he said it was not legit (why was it on the tray liner then fuckhead?) I checked the menu, they would have lost 10 cents.  Lady taking my order after P.J.L. (pussy John Leguizamo) walked away pretty embarassed said "sorry"  Not her fault.  Never saw her working there after then, was probably tired of that guys shit.  I don't blame you.Last trip here, they have promos on their drink cups for free shit.  Awesome.  We all know this is the garbage that costs them nothing but I am a sucker for something free.  On my trip before the last, I got one for a free corndog.  SCORE!  I cash it in on my last trip, and the guy ringing up the order said it would be on a different ticket.  No sweat, I could give a shit less as long as I get my corndog.  Go to get my order, ask where the corndog is.  P.J.L. butts in the middle of the order, says "This is your order, this is what you have" and was a fucking prick about it.  Me, the customer.  Yanks the receipt out of my hand, gives me an attitude about it.  Who the fuck talks to a customer like that, even at a low rent fast food joint?  Fuck you.  Seriously.  The guy who took my order tried to explain the situation and dicknose literally looks at him, puts his hand in front of the guys face, and says "ssssshhhhhh" and snaps his fingers the same way I do to my dogs to keep them barking or eating drywall.  Who degrades their employees like that?  All he was trying to do was explain my free item was on another ticket.  Instead of listening, he made a complete asshat out of himself.  It was a corndog, what does that cost you anyway, about 1other cents in batter, a stick, and a combination of horse eyeballs and badger penis meat?  Dude (cashier guy, tattoo on your arm), tell that guy to get fucked and get a better job.  No one deserves that shit.  I am actually ashamed I didn't say something for you, I truly am.What would have normally gotten a decent review is what it is.  My rant speaks for itself.  One shithead ruins it for the ones working for him.  For the ones working there, I will pray for you.  You need it.  P.J.L., get out of there and become a pimp in Tijuana, they need midget controlling assholes over there.  You would do great at that.
other Great food!!! The French dip is to die for!! Great Service! Clean and fancy especially for the area it's located in!  Def a hidden gem! My husband and I both love going here and can't wait until next time.
other a G Spot is a myth.  and Dr Graffenberg was a mad scientist.So its no surprise that I couldn't find the Gelato Spot either.  Shannon spouts, "I love gelato so much, I would bathe in it".  Hmmm, that's interestingI drove in and around the dirt road... and went up and down Scottsdale ... explored the box... looked south of the landing strip at Scottsdale Airpark... manually googled it... orally asked the passerbysRoad several times and I couldn't find it ANYWHEREMaybe I need to do more research.  Perhaps some field research...Or a targeted focus group*** UPDATE  ***Its on Shea Blvd??  No wonder I couldn't find it-I was looking down the wrong road*** UPDATE  ***Thanks Jake P for "Yeah it is on Shea, in the strip mall area east of scottsdale rd near the Harkins Theater and Pita Jungle and such.... "BUT the point of this review was sarcasm.  i.e. g- spot is hard to find*** UPDATE  ***Now I have a girl, "Shannon W", telling me where g-spot is.  She writes, "It's on 74th St. and Shea, in between Coffee Plantation and Pita Jungle."Shannon W:  The point of this review was sarcasm.  i.e. g-spots are hard to find
other There are so many good things for me to say about this place that I have no idea where to begin.The ambiance is so amazing no matter what time of day you go. The small, intimate bar area (with quite a few pretty men!) is lovely on a sunny day out, while the tables inside are the perfect place for a romantic date. The menu is so great, carrying lots of new age food items (quinoa, black forbidden rice bowl, kale,and lots of dishes carrying local food items). It does make me very sad that they do not have a lot of vegetarian/vegan menu items. One time I tried to order the wood-fired vegetables and the waiter *swore* it was vegan. As soon as I tasted it I knew it had butter on it, and the waiter subsequently learned he had no idea what "vegan" meant. We ended up having to call a manager over.The cocktail menu is so interesting it's hard to decide what to get. My favorite is the Dark and Stormy, which has ginger beer. *the BEST* cocktail around IMO. Do not pass up dessert. The bananas foster is amazing! Not traditional but good in and of its own.
other I went here to try a  new salon and they were very rude when i first walked in like, I was wasting there time, I just wanted to know about there tanning prices and they kept trying to up sell me on there other products even though i kept telling them no thank you, finally when i got a tanning bed they asked how long i wanted to go for, i said the full  time and the lady tells me i should do less time because I'm a red head, I told her that i have been tanning for years now that I'm fine with the full time, she still gave me a hard time saying i should do less, finally i was like whatever and did less time. The only reason I give them two stars is because there beds are really nice and i got good color from them, but it was not worth the hassle for me to want to go back.
other We had a fun, early dinner on the patio here at BoomBozz.  The advertised happy hour specials appeared to be a very good value; my fave was the soft pretzels & cheese.  I also had the wedge salad and it was excellent - they don't skimp on the blue cheese!  My son had the pepperoni pizza and even his discriminating palate was very happy.  A crisp blonde draft (for me) and ice cream (for him) polished us off and we left full & happy.
other Love my Chick-fil-a!  Wow, they have a system and it is super fast in the drive thur.  Amazed and they are always super friendly!  They always get the order right!!!  ++++
3 This place is so cool! The menus are on the walls in sharpie along with signatures from a lot of local athletes. They will not present a bill to you, but rather trust you to tell them what you ordered and pay the correct amount. The food is great, artery clogging, and comes in huge portions. I like the smothered chicken with yams and green beans, and order it every time. I always want to sleep off the rest of the day too. Saturday they do a great rib plate. Good spot for those working or living in the city.
other I went to NOCA about a month after is opened and was wowed. I told all my fellow foodies about my wonderful experience, the innovative menu and all the little extras that made the meal a really special dining experience in Phoenix. I went back with friends twice after in the coming months and was pleased each time. I just went back this past Saturday though, and would have to say I would no longer suggest it for a special night out. It was as if the magic was gone and that the place was showing its age and loosing its "specialness". It was really just ok. The chef's talent shows, but too many other let downs. When we arrived for our 8:30 reservation the place was crowded. The host was friendly and told us that our table would be ready soon and it was. We sat down at our table and that's when things started turning out not as well as expected. Seated in a back corner--which I did not mind---I noticed the walls were filthy---scratched and beat up and dirty. That was my view, so of course its all I could focus on. The waiter did not show up for other min. to take our drink order, and when he did it took 20 min. to get them to us. He apologized, but at 8:4other on a Saturday night that waiting for a first drink is not fun. When then settled down with our menus and picked our choices. It was then we were told that they were out of the veal --which of course other of us had chosen by then, and that there was only one Skate dish--which of course the other other of us had decided on. They were also out of 3 other items. I felt I was back in the old Eleve (located in this same spot)--the food was great there as well---when they did not run out of many items on the menu. They may be ok when you have a larger menu, but with a small menu to begin with this is a real disappointment. Gone were the pop rocks that I thought was so fun as an intermezzo, instead a spoon of something that was not described was set down in front of us. A simple salad--good--was $15---and most starters are at least that much. Good, but not worth the price. Otherwise, entrees were good--not special, but tasty and served with good presentation. The cotton candy is still there--and still an attention getter. And I still love the desert selections---especially the malt that I had with mini doughnuts in with dipping sauces. I think I am able to overlook the fact that its really not an attractive room--the energy from the kitchen and the close tables add noise and excitement to the room, but the art and lighting is ugly and now that its starting to look run down as well--there are too many new, beautiful places in the city with equally good food and equally as pricey that are not in strip mall. And they usually still have most menu selections on a Saturday night.
3 ordered the steak sandwich (medium rare).  Came out cooked medium.  Still very delicious.  French fries were not good, way too salty.  Server seemed as though he did not want to be there, with a grouchy attitude.
other Just dropped off a pre-paid label package.  A young lady was on duty.  Very cheerful.  This was a dead-easy transaction.  Drop off package, get receipt.  Other than having to wait in line (there was one person ahead of me), it was quick and easy.
other My new favorite place.  I love this pizza.  I became a vegetarian in March.  So cheese pizza with mushrooms and olives is very important to me.  And Mamma Mia's is cheap and delicious, my favorite combo.  And my constant companion, my 9 year old daughter born in Philly and a fan of hoagies, loves their turkey subs.  I'm just in it for the pizza.  And if you sit outside you can watch the people going to the liquor store next door and watch the people playing frogger to get across the street to the Vig.  Pretty good people watching.
other I love Stinkweeds.  Owned by local commerce booster Kimber Lanning, Stinkweeds provides better selection and pricing than many national vendors.  The staff are helpful, and if they don't have what you're looking for, they'll happily special order it for you.   The parking lot is smallish, but I've never had a problem finding a space.  The central location is a big plus.  They share the plaza with other locally-owned businesses, so it makes for a fun shopping excursion.  Their listening stations are well-stocked with a variety of music, and the staff loves to talk music, as well.  They also carry a great selection of music mags, as well as some books.
other These guys are great.  I had an old Craftsman mower, probably 8yo, that even sat unused in a basement for a couple years.  It coughed and wheezed, barely even turning over.  I brought it to them and now it works (and even looks) brand new!
other I love how all other Yelpers reviewing this company have discovered the same issues that would never permit me to use their services again. Company is a disaster and should be reported to the BBB.
other Went here for a saturday lunch with a girlfriend. The building is amazing and beautiful, very clean. I'm not generally a "Scottsdale crowd" type of gal, but the place was nice, and the music was good too. The menu looked so delicious that we had a hard time deciding what to get. Our waiter was very kind, didn't try to rush us, and gave us plenty of time to decide. We had a house salad, dirty chips, and an order of sliders. The house salad seemed a bit over priced for what it was, but the dirty chips were really good! The sliders were average, and well priced.I really want to go back and try a happy hour sometime to try more of the small plates, our only regret was that the order of dirty chips was BIG, we could only finish half of it. A half sized portion would have been perfect, though!
3 I really want to rate the place higher. I like what it's all about. Instead of pulling the building down and rebuilding something in that space, it has been converted to a community space.   I went to see one of their cult classics, and the staff was ok. It was completely amateur hour - I guess that's ok for the type of movie, etc. The problem was this was a sold out movie, and the staff brought in folding chairs to sit on to watch - that would have been ok before the movie started, but ithey did it one at a time making noise for the first 30 minutes of the movie - clanging, whispering, etc. Then they kept getting up and down.  They seating was pretty bad. Low seats that reclined - normally that's ok, but there's usually some spring to it. These had no support at all. Halfway through my back was hurting and would have to readjust - but there was no comfortable way to sit in the chairs.
other I have been to Lux a few times now and it has completely won me over with its delicious coffee and mouth watering chocolate croissants . There always seems to be a line but it moves fast. Among the numerous coffee shops in the area, Lux definitely stands out.
other Great Pizza. Great Service.We've been here a few times since it opened. And always look forward to going. We have never had a bad experience. Each time has been great. Our waiter Dave was perfect, always on the ball.
other Great cleaners, open weird hours, always polite to me, anyhoo.
other This place sucks!! I moved to the valley and have yet to find that "go to " chinese spot, sooo I decided to give this spot a try. I called my order in and was assured by the employee that all the food is cooked to order, always fresh. So I picked up my food, and what do you know, I got some old azz fried rice with some microwaved shrimp. WTF??!! I give this place other thumbs down and I would not eat here if I was hungry as a hostage :(
other I really enjoyed my mani/pedi with Trisha!  She took her time and taught me about manicuring my nails from home which I loved.I went in for the Groupon basic mani/pedi deal and left feeling like I got a lot more! It was the most pleasant experience I've had at a nail salon. The conversation was easy and Trish is a great person. I will be coming back to Trish for nails again! The entire staff was friendly and professional. Great Salon!!
other In Phoenix on Spring break vacation, we found Baby Kay's by using the entertainment coupon book we bought to use while out there. They were in the front for fine dining, and had a great coupon deal, along with a sample menu. Everything on the sample menu sounded delish, and we very much like the spice of Cajun cooking. It was a little hard to find, although we were not at all familiar with the area. We had the wings as an app. and used the Louisiana gold hot sauce, something new to us that we are having trouble finding in Ohio since we fell in love with it there. The gumbo was outstanding, and even the alfredo pasta had a spice sprinkled on top for a Cajun style kick... it was unexpected, and awesome! Huge portions - that we both had plenty to take with us for a whole other left over meal. ... the prices were great, especially with the coupon (or actually the entertainment card that they punch for fine dining restaurants). Excellent staff- close to closing for the night, and welcomed us in, and didn't rush us at all - made sure we were happy with everything we ordered, very friendly! Definitely would recommend it for any one who likes a little Cajun kick, and something different from chain restaurants...
3 I went to Susie's for lunch the other day. I got it to go, as I was alone and don't like to eat at restaurants by myself. There was only a few people inside and the food seemed to come pretty fast if you eat in. I probably waited about 20 mins for my to go food. I thought the restaurant was in need of a remodel. But they don't seem like they have the greatest hours, as they close at 5pm. So it is a lunch place, not a dinner place.I got my food and took it home. I live not even a mile from this place. I ordered Sopes. They had shredded beef, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes and salsa. I thought they were very comparable to the ones I have had before, which were homemade. I would like to go back for lunch, but as I'm not home much for lunch it might be difficult! Definitely worth a second chance!
3 Nice restaurant, good food, SLOW SLOW SLOW Service.Went there with a group, and the food was all good but the service wasn't great. I ordered Chicken Katsu before the rest of the group ordered tons of Sushi...the Sushi came out slow, but no one cared. And then I realized we had been there 2.other hours and I still didn't have my Chicken Katsu - I asked the waiter about it and he had totally forgot. I eventually got my food but everyone else was done eating - he was apologetic and we got a free dessert but it just sucked for me since I don't eat sushi...
other I seriously can't get enough of this spicy goodness! All I ever wanna go is SIAM and nowhere else. I've been to so many Thai restaurants in AZ the past month and NOTHING compares to Siam! BEEF MA SA MAN curry is so addictingly amazing and the pad thai is always cooked to perfection. I'm actually craving it as I type this.
other I don't think anyone who gave over a other has ever eaten Italian food in Chicago. I struggled to give other stars, but figured the wings were decent .#1) No celery salt on the Dog#2) No cucumber on the Dog#3) WORST OF ALL the GYRO, was not off a spit it was processed#4) Also, living 30 years in Chicago I have never had a gyro covered in more lettuce than there were onioins. #5) Since when does a Gyro (not in Chicago) have Feta Cheese & almost not Tatziki#6) The PIZZA IS NOT CHICAGO STYLE ITS 100% New York#7) Wings are a 6 out of 10#8) THERE IS NO DEEP DISH PIZZA OFFERED OR THICK CRUST???#9) I apologize they have now gone from other to other star... PLEASE CHANGE YOUR NAME YOU"RE A DISGRACE TO CHICAGO!!!Don't think I will give this place another shot no reason
other Cool place but don't try to arrange a special event. The proprietor was arragont, unflexible and unethical when I held my friend's bachelorette party at The Duce. Be warned!
other I found this place when we needed a place to meet for a business lunch.  I had the smoked BBQ chicken which was good but that seems to be all I get when I go.  I've tried some of the other dishes but haven't really liked them.  My wife loves the fried pickles which I'm not a fan of.  The portions are huge but there does not seem to be anything special I can remember besides really large portions.  I suppose the biscuits topped with sugar smothered in honey butter are good but I also want to live to be at least 50 and they are not worth dying for.  As unimpressed as I am with the food, the service is very good.  I've been there a few times now and have always been pleased with they way they treat us.  Everything from the speed and attentiveness has been good.
other I just thought I'd post an update.  I planned never to go back, but was with a friend who really wanted one of their breakfast items.  I skipped ordering ANY food whatsoever and merely ordered coffee and watched her eat.  As fate would have it, she had a BACK HAIR in her scrambled eggs (we are other for other now).  My gag reflex is going off as I type this.  My husband, friends, and I have renamed this place the Black Hair Diner, and we've decided they have actual black bears cooking in the kitchen, since they can't seem to keep black hairs out of their food.
other This is not a fancy place.  It's address is on Scottsdale Road, but it's easier to get to from Shea, about a block east of Scottsdale.  It's split into two sections.  As you walk in, if you head to the left, there is a bar with a couple of pool tables.  I can't really say that I've spent any time in that section.  We head to the right, where there is a central bar, with booths along the walls.  If you are into Karoake, this is a great place to go.  The DJ has a great voice, and many of the usuals do as well (of course there are quite a few who don't, but that's to be expected).  We've been here dozens of times, and never not had a good time.  It's casual, and very reasonably priced.  The food is way above average for this casual of a bar.  The shrimp are spiced to perfection, and the chili is to die for.
3 Other than at grocery stores, it's becoming more and more difficult to find a simple, decent donut shop. And for some strange reason, there aren't any Dunkin Donuts in Chandler or Gilbert (can someone explain this phenomena to me?).  I know, for donut purists out there, Dunkin Donuts is just another corporate chain.  But I happen to think their donuts and coffee are pretty tasty!  That said, Bosa Donuts is nice alternative.  It's a small shop with a good variety of freshly made donuts.  I especially liked the chocolate frosted cake donuts.  They were really good.  The coffee was ok, let's say... better than "breakroom" coffee.  Located just north of the Downtown Chandler area, Bosa Donuts has both walk-in and drive-thru service 2other hours a day, 7 days a week.
other I was working in the area and craving a healthy salad for lunch. My usual love affair salad place was too far so my colleague and I decided to try Jason's Deli. He'd gone there for sandwiches many times and never tried the salad bar. For about $7.50 after tax you can get a pretty good selection of veggies, dressings, even a few pre-made pasta salad options. They also have crackers and mini muffins. The salad area seemed clean and well stocked. There were enough tables to sit, even during the lunch rush.
other This is a cool venue to catch a show. I actually played a show here and it was good times. They have a large dance floor or an area where people can gather to watch performers. They also have a nice sized Bar which can handle a good sized crowd. We all know that is a must when it comes getting a drink in a crowed venue. I really enjoyed this spot and had a fun time rocking peoples face off!
other I have completed this run (obviously not the 27th annual edition) other times now. The course is always the same - a bit hillier than other Papgo courses as it takes a right along the sidewalk behind the zoo, but the organization is always excellent. The t-shirt is another good draw to this event - a long sleeve shirt that changes color in the sun. There is always food at the end, a raffle, and a great crowd. One of the best events on the racing calendar each year and an excellent way to start the new year off right!
other My gf and I just tried the Oggie bc we werent super hungry.  Even with that, the food was super yummy.  I wonder what would happen to us if we are actually starving.  the sauce that came with the Oggie was excellent too, so I suggested that you shouldnt eat the pasty without the sauce.  The decoration in the store is quite unique: church pews and wall and table deocrations.  It's a must go if you are around the area.
3 E-Z Buffet is a Chinese buffet that recently opened in my neighborhood.  It was about $10 for dinner .  The place had a bunch of tables so seating was easy.   You can also get take out.They have a lot of food to choose from, typical Chinese fare plus sushi, fried chicken wings, roast beef, salad fixings, pudding & fruit.  They also had ice cream for desert, not soft serve but hard ice cream.  I like the General Tso's Chicken, Scallion Pork and their freshly steamed green beans.  I loved their rocky road ice cream. The wait staff was prompt and friendly.  I really liked that.This place is worth trying.  If you go please write a review.  I'd love to know what others think.
other The parking is my beef with this place.  Why does a customer have to pay $1other for each time we park at the garage?  If you move in and out three times, that's $36 for parking.  Yes, my company was paying, but this was just outright stupid and I wouldn't make my company pay for this again.I've been to Phoenix twice since then, and I've avoided this place and stayed at the Marriot.  Much better place.
other 07/09/2008  Just went there last week for the first, and last, time.  I read the good reviews, so I was expecting much more.  I am a first generation American; both my parents were German and came over in their 20's.  I lived there for a few years, have eaten German food all my life, and have been to many German restaurants in many different states over the years.  I really wanted to like this place, as there are not many German establishments around here, but this place was terrible!  We were the only people in the place at 2pm, and still had horrible service.  ???  We were ignored much of the time and then when the waitress did come, she would forget things we had asked her for.  The waitress didn't understand German, as in the German MENU options, so I ordered from the menu using the English translations, and she was still confused. I had to POINT at the options.  YES, there really is CUCUMBER salad on the menu.  The bread was stale, the schnitzel was hard, there was a hair in my cucumber salad and my potato pancakes were just ...disgusting.  They also gave me fries instead of the usual sides????  I am guessing that they just reheated leftovers from the dinner the night before, because that is exactly what it tasted like.  Plus, I actually got charged the wrong prices - like lunch salad was 3.50, but showed up on my bill as 5.00, etc.  I was too frustrated to even bring it up and just left, disappointed.  Waste of time and money, I will not return.  Maybe at dinner time things are better, but DO NOT EVEN TRY THE LUNCH!  Yuck.Oh, and the website is outdated- wrong prices and discontinued menu items.
3 Awesome location, cool place....the Chopped Salad is by far the most amazing salad I have ever had in my life (but way...and I mean way to small)...If it were double the portion for the price I would probably visit more. I had a flight when I was there...it took forever (as I know flights are supposed to)...but this was ridiculous...the buffalo meat is so gross...it reminds me of when a stray dog visits my lawn...The BBQ sauce is good....the staff is just OK. Nothing mind blowing. I think staff in a place with a pricey menu should spoil the guests a bit...Give away a free desert when you know the service and meal is just OK...this may bring your customer base back to visit just because you redeemed yourself at the end.Overall its a cool place. It fits with the downtown Scottsdale lifestyle. But stay away from the buffalo, because it will give doggy bag a whole new meaning....
other In town for business, and came to Pappadeaux's for dinner...what a great experience.  Hostess, wait staff, and servers were all outstanding.  The food was amazing.  Perfectly cooked vegetables to accompany the Costa Rican Mahi.  Ice cold beer on a hot, 10other degree day was a welcome addition!Although we later found out our waiter was in training (it was his first day), he was attentive, professional, and available to answer any questions we had.Highly recommended.
other Please excuse this review as I am writing it as I come to from my food coma. We just moved to Phoenix and at the time of dining we were not familiar with the Fox Restaurant Group. We happened upon CD on accident on a Tuesday night. I must say the place was pretty hoppin' for an early week night. We ordered the pretzels with fondue, the fried chicken and the steak. It was so good we didn't even speak to each other through the entire sitting. It was the kind of meal you don't mind having indigestion after because you get the pleasure of re tasting the deliciousness. Gross, I know, but you know what I'm talking about! The server we had was as good as a ghost. We never wanted for anything but he left us alone. I wasn't super crazy about the monkey bread but my honey ate it like we hadn't had a ridiculously large meal 1other minutes before. I'd kinda like to shave off like a 1/other of a star because the staff was ultra trendy/Indie as were a majority of the patrons. They looked like H&M and Urban Outfitters threw up all over them but if that's the gimmick I'm ok with it since the food was so amazing.
other One of the things I love about my neighborhood is that Cornish Pasty is w/in walking distance.Every pasty Ive had here is awesome. My personal faves include the shepherds pie, the chicken pot pie, and the thanksgiving pasty.Yes its tiny and loud, but it adds to the charm. Also, the smell that you smell right when you walk in the door= heaven.We eat in and get to go. Tip for to go: have a beer or a cider w/ your wait.
other My date and I started in the basement which was super cozy. While waiting, we were distracted by the amazing aroma of food surrounding us from other tables. Once we sat down, we could NOT make a decision about what to order--everything looked so good. Our server was very helpful in aiding us with picking appropriate sized plates (we were starving and nervous we wouldn't have enough haha). We left with a to go box and no room for dessert! Loved it. Can't wait to go back. GREAT date night spot. But we prepared to wait and have a drink, this place is busy for good reason.
other I visited this location a few months ago for the first time, and returned for my second visit the very next day. I got their standard chicken and waffle plate on my first visit, and just chicken and macaroni the next day.Both visits were pleasant and the food was delicious.My only criticism is that the waffles I got were a bit on the thin side. I've had chicken and waffles from many different soul food places all over the US and in comparison LoLo's waffles were just okay. The chicken on the other hand was A+. It was tender and juicy and well fried.I see myself coming back here again.
other I dropped off a ton of things here when I was liquidating my life in this town and it was a terrific experience.Their donation program is quick and easy (just drive around to the back of the store and put it in a bin) and really helps out people by selling things at affordable prices and the profits go to provide assistance to the community.Such great people at this location especially.
other I really love their sourdough bread. I get the veggie on sourdough and really love the taste.Drive through line is a little long and sometimes the bread hurts the top of my mouth, but this is my favorite fast food place.OH.. the pizza is great too! I always get cheese with jalapenos. The bread they use for the crust rules. Indoor and outdoor seating. Staff does not speak English very well, but I have never had an issue with my order. Been there at least ten times.
other NEW LOCATION FOR 2012: Portland Parkway in Downtown Phoenix, Portland St. & Central Ave, right across from the Roosevelt Light Rail Station! Saturday, November 12, 10am-4pmFind more info here: http://www.localfirstaz.com/fall-festival/Bigger location = more fun!
other In a sentance: Four Peaks is DEFINATLY something to write Yelp about! From the moment I realized that there were more reviews about this place than I'd care to read in one sitting, I knew this was going to be good!! I realized it was going to be fantastic when i pulled up with my friend Darius and we had a hard time finding a parking spot at 3pm. We met a friend for lunch and the place was laid back, chill, clean, cozy and yet modern - perfect. I had the French Dip, thinly sliced roast beef on a nice hogie bun. Everything was good not too salty not too greasy, loved it! Darius got the Fish N Chips and it was incredible!! Crispy batter dipped big pieces of fish, iot was crispy and crunchy but soft and delightful on the inside. The chips were also batter dipped and had great flavor. I was in love! this is my best recommendation for a meal at Four Peaks!To my yelpers i say: there is limited parking, so when you pull up and see nothing but cars lining the street, do NOT be alarmed! there will be a table available! Another thing, get the fish n chips! It's duh-vine!
other Love it!!! Wish we still lived in Arizona as Chino is the one thing we miss. Every time I think about Chino Bandido my mouth starts watering. If I am ever in the state again I will drive out of my way just to go to it again. YUMMY!
other Eorth a trip for pasta or their salads. Both are wonderful. And if you like garlic they know what you mean when you say xtra garlic. They actually give you extra. Yummm. Of course you will probably not be kissing anyone that night.
other I needed to grab a bite on a day in the office, so I thought I'd take a little trek over to Sandwich Club. Lots of my former co-workers would tell me that they loved the food here.As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by the owner. A super cool dude. He promptly asked if it was my first time there, and he asked where I was from. I like a little small talk before a sandwich.In any case, I ended up going with a no-mayo tuna salad sandwich.Do you remember that time in junior high when you saw a pretty girl and you never had the guts to go talk to her? But your friends dared you to do it? The no-mayo tuna salad is the pretty girl. I dare you to try it. It's amazing. The capers and lemon juice make this so flavorful. You'll be holding hands with this, and it will grace your lips in no time....unlike that girl from Jr. High who secretly despised you because you were fat. Oh wait.The menu seems quite diverse, with many sandwich options, and they also make crepes.The food tasted great, the service was great. I'd definitely come back for more and try something else.Afterall....who doesn't love a good sandwich!
other Maybe I ate at a different restaurant than the other people, or once they got through the "soft opening"  they gave up, because this place was not good.The service was mediocre at best, they seemed scattered and unfocused, took five minutes to get water.  I gave up on ordering anything else after that.The food?  Bland hamburger, that was cooked perfectly in the center.  Too bad that outside of the center inch it was completely overcooked and dry.  Soggy duck fat fried and average sweet potato fritters.  Let's talk about this "coal oven".  While the burgers are cooked in a coal oven, you could tell by the smoke hanging over the restaurant, they are cooked in an iron skillet i.e. pan fried!  The coal adds absolutely zero to the burger.Overall, if I am going to spend $10 on a burger with no sides, it better be perfect, and this wasn't.  I would also hope $other would get me more than two fritters.
other I struggled a lot on whether to give this a 3 or a 4. Honestly, I'm not happy with my decision and I'm thinking it may deserve a 3. This place is new to me, but I'm no stranger to "Mongolian BBQ" as I've been a long-time fan of YC's. Obviously I'm going to compare the two. I liked that they had fresh meat, but it was a little fatty and since they use thicker chunks as opposed to shaved and frozen, it takes longer to cook your food. They seem to stack up orders on the hot disc. It definitely lacks the flair you get when eating at YC's, but the novelty of that wears off after a few times anyway. Plus, I know it's wrong, but I prefer the frozen shaved meats to these chunks. It's just different though - I wouldn't say frozen is better, just that I prefer it. I would even go so far as to say I preferred a lot of their fixin's outside of the meat. They had a better selection of spicy powders and sauces than YC's, and this place definitely caters to the spicy food lover more. They also had better vegetables. I should also mention they have a better selection of meats including two types of beef and even shrimp and scallops. Even your choices of noodles and rice was more extensive. Come to think of it, they really beat the shit out of YC's hands down in the available food department.And taste? Well, it was delicious I must say. Of course, I assembled the dish, so if it wasn't any good I have to accept at least part of the blame if not all. If I had to compare, I'd say YC's is very reliable and good consistantly because I tend to always create roughly the same dish. GG's I could see having a much broader range of flavors and experiences. The ambiance was okay for a strip-mall restaurant. It was kinda kitschy, but charming enough and fairly comfy. They had attention to detail. I think YC's (depending on which one you go to) is a "no frills" sort of place compared to this. They were piping in some good contemporary alternative music as well... for a minute, I thought someone had lifted my ipod.Service was attentive, but odd since this is a "get your own food" kind of place... They also have menus which is strange considering you basically put your own dish together and since the server explains the process again to you in detail. I felt a bit like a child being explained something so simple and obvious, but my girlfriend had a confused look on her face, so maybe it's a good thing they do that. Regulars probably just get escorted over to the line.I think my main gripe with it was the tiny bowl they gave me for the fixin's... but then again, you aren't putting noodles or rice in there like you do at YC's - they add that as they cook it for you. So I suppose the portions are comparable. Then there's the price. A little high perhaps - maybe higher than YC's (I know they used to be other bucks for a lunch bowl). But you do get a lot for your money if you know how to pack the food in the bowl. So I guess I was right to give it a other instead of a 3... turns out I really liked it. I think this would be a real treat for someone who hasn't had Mongolian BBQ before. I consider this to be a great alternative to YC's... Impressive.
other We went to Milagro Grill for the 2nd time and it was delicious again.  The ambiance and patio are very nice.  The service is fast and friendly.  And the food is fantastic.  This time we had the chips and guac and pb&j appetizer.  Wow, both are wonderful.  We also had the chicken and chorizo mac n cheese-fantastic and filling!  Last time we had tacos with pineapple which was also wonderful.  Can't believe the place isn't packed every night  We live in the area and will go back soon!  You should too.
other Once again, the pizza was delish. They were super busy last time I went, and my gf and I had to wait a while to see a server, but they apologized for the wait, gave us two free sodas and were understanding that we needed our food to go ( Kick-Ass started in like 30 minutes!).  Very cool.
3 Their beef gyro's are delicious!  Great portions for what you pay.  And their falafel is really good too.  Not a great portion it seems for an order of hummus, we got like one piece of pita.  Just didn't seem to be much there.  We always do carryout, and either the bartender is really nice and funny, or just werent very friendly.
other This place has decent, prompt sandwiches, and I'll take it any day over every other sandwich chain in the Valley.
other YUMMMMMM!!!! I was brought to this place by a friend and was so glad to find it! Very clean and unique casual setting. Staff were very friendly, food was hot, fresh and amazingly gooy...definately a 4+ napkin kind of meal. So happy to see they serve Chicken philly -steak as well as the usual philly cheese steak and sweet potatoe fries! Find out where this place is because it could be easily over looked and you would be missing out on some deeee-licous food. This place is a must try!
other I ate here on a Sunday afternoon and was impressed by the food quality, very friendly service, and speed of service. On the strength of other Yelps, I had the gravlux with dill mashed potatoes and tomato basil salad. All excellent as others have said. I had broccoli and cole slaw as my other sides. The broccoli was tender without being overcooked and the slaw was a pleasant vinegar-based, not creamy, variety that complemented the rest of the food nicely. The food filled the plate without being overwhelming and I found room for one of the Beaver cookies, actually two large waffle-wafer cookies with a lightly flavored lemon cream between them. The cookies are kept in a chilled pastry case, probably because of the cream filling. A pleasant meal on a hot summer day.
other I couldn't wait to get home and yelp this place. Five stars, too! After a (raw chicken) bad experience some 13 years ago, I hadn't been to Bandera until tonight. WOW! It was a GREAT experience!!! We started off with a grilled artichoke which was fabulous! Both of us had the Texas Hill Country Ribs which came with cole slaw (not your ordinary cole slaw) and the most delish matchstick fries. Unfortunately, I don't eat seeds and nuts (peanuts in the cole slaw...my husband loved it) but the very polite and wonderful server, Sarah, offered some other sides and I picked the braised red cabbage, which came with a little goat cheese on the top which was to die-for delish!! Home made wonderful braised red cabbage! The entire meal was SUPERB! The service was phenomenal, and we were lucky enough to sit by the kitchen and see all of the dishes come out...they all looked YUMMY! I am so happy that my neighbor suggested Bandera's ribs, and will go back frequently as you can tell this place is run as a tight ship. Everyone is polished, polite and efficient! The food is an experience in perfection, and the service tip top!Next time, I'll take some pictures (if I'm not too hungry)... I don't think it's a shorts and jeans type of place but a dressy/casual type of place, if you know what I mean...REALLY EXCELLENT FOOD!
other Very good. My wife and I stopped by randomly on our way back and had beef pho and veggie pho. I eat large portions and this is the first time ever I didn't finish a bowl of pho. If in the area we will stop again for sure.
other There are few resources in Arizona for dancers, actors and performers, so it's best to order online if you have the time to wait for shipping. Dee's Dancewear is overpriced and because they know they are the only game in town, their customer service (and return policies) have suffered.In an emergency situation, you're better suited going to Mischa's Dancewear on 33rd Ave and Bell or Capezio's in Scottsdale. Otherwise, order online and steer clear of this establishment when possible.
other Drinking + Arcade Games. This should be an obvious winner, right? Wrong.Oh, how wrong. Eating here is like eating in a casino, only less classy and with worse food. Beers are overpriced but absolutely necessary to make it through the event. Those combo deals that include beers and a game card seem like a good idea, until it's 4other minutes later, you're out of points, you're nowhere near drunk and you've already spent $40.If you go late, try not to get syphilis when you walk by San Felipe's.
3 I found myself in Phoenix for a week. I prefer Marriott, but a co-worker insisted on Hilton....and then didn't go on the trip. Nice.Anyway, the stay was a hodgepodge of experiences. Downsides: The room was nondescript on the whole, but the neck of the shower was pulled partly out of the wall and the shower curtain was partly torn and had red (?!?) mold on it. I didn't have a car, so the parking lot didn't bother me, but the area on one side of the hotel was sketchy and had a fair amount of undesirable foot traffic. The nearest station to get on the light rail was 3 blocks either way from the hotel.Upsides: The staff was friendly and super-helpful in recommending EXCELLENT restaurants, including hole-in-wall, genuine Mexican joints. The hotel has a shuttle van that will, if you reserve it or can snag a ridealong, take you anywhere within five miles of the hotel for free, and then pick you up again. Naturally you should tip the driver (also a great guy), but it still beats taking a cab. The driver gets bonus points for letting us jump out and grab a coffee on the way to our destination! It also is only 1.other blocks from Fez, a fantastic restaurant. I was not knocked out by the facility, but the people were great. I'll still probably stay a Marriott user when I return, but I'll sure consider the Garden Inn again.
other I'm so glad I have a nice coffee shop within walking distance of my office! Though the location is a plus, the real reason I have become a regular is that they open earlier than Lux - 6 am - and have free WiFi. During a two month string of early morning test prep, the openers remembered me and asked about my progress on a daily basis.My favorite part about Urban Bean is that ALL of their products are compostable and they run a compost in the back. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because they have yet to add large tables (for two or three people to spread out books to study). Other than that - it's my fave!
other This weekend was my first time back since they have done the huge remodel and under new ownership. This place still has the same comfort feel to it and is cozy. Havent tried the food yet but enjoyed the drinks and the ambience in the bar. Hopefully the food is better than what it used to be.
other I rarely disagree with the average yelp ratings... I tried Blue Adobe based on great reviews but was greatly disappointed.I really can't find a redeeming quality about the night... I had their "killer margarita" which is a cheaper house margarita, it was lousy, i was a bartender for some time myself, there is no reason to make a margarita that bad, you can do better, especially here in AZ we are a mecca of citrus!The bean and cheese dip appetizer was uninspired, nothing special... I saw lobster tamales on the menu and couldn't get past them, i could not think of a way that someone could make a tamale with lobster and make it well, so i was really excited to see how they do it... poorly was how they did it, lobster was over cooked there was very little of it in the tamale and the biggest issue was exactly what i thought it would be, the corn masa just overpowered the little lobster that was in the tamale... they could have put imitation crab in there and saved them self a bunch of money and it would taste the same... it just doesn't work! There was a raspberry chipotle sauce on the side that was very good, but again this too took away from the whole point of the dish: the lobster.  tried a chimmichunga, whatever, not special.  service was no good, our waitress was very frantic, I felt like i was a burden or a bother to her (and no, I'm not. I've spent years in food service, makes you very kind to your server)It seems like snow birds keep this place in business, the restaurant was full of them... they must forget what their experience was like over the summers...
3 What can you say about Beni's - Not bad and not great.I have been to Benihana in several different cities and for a chain teppan restaurant it's ok.  My fave was in San Diego, could have been the company we were with.  I would definately say they are pretty consistant everytime we have been.  The teppan is a little pricey, the sushi is consistantly good (they also offer the all you can eat sushi), and the sake selection is ok (very average).  I do get tired of hearing the birthday song 10 to 1other times while we are dining.
