4 These pants are just as beautiful in person as on the website. the fabric is luxuriously soft. two things to note: they are very lightweight jersey material, and they run a bit small. if you're in between sizes, you might want to size up. it's possible they'll stretch while wearing. i also wish they had pockets, but they just have a one small back pocket that's not sewn down and seems made for perhaps a tissue but nothing else. all of these "flaws" are made up for by the fact that these are abso
4 I liked the top, it is cute, but i didn't keep it as i have similar tops like it and i had better options. however:color: it is true that htere are differentials in the coloring of fabrics in this top, but that is not necessairly a bad thing, it kind of gives t personality.lace part (this is where i have a similr one, tank all alce like that): darker ivory, drkest part of hte shirt. cut to neck is flatetering, and different from the low lunging things we see a lot of.body: true to size, i
1 Really unattractive shirt. nothing good i can say about it. horrible fit. i can't imagine this would look good on anyone.
4 I ordered my normal size large and am sadly returning because it's overly large and long on my frame. the slight dolman sleeves are too long and wide and better suited for longer arms than mine. love the pointelle sleeves. they add a soft feminine vibe. hard to tell from the photos, but the texture is almost fuzzy.  the gray color is beautiful and  its actually made from multi colored beige and gray that looks silver in the light. it doesn't itch or shed. i don't like it enough to try a smaller
4 This is a very unique piece. it seems to be easy to wear and it is very comfy. but i normally wear a medium/size 8 and it was too big. i might size down to a petite medium of just go for small. it seems this might be a trial and error type of outfit.
4 This skirt runs small because of the stitching around the hips. the waist fit fine but the hips were very snug, and i'm relatively slim in the hips.
4 I tried this on in the navy/white combination and loved it, except it is cut rather full or large through the waist especially. if you can size it down so it fits you, you will love it. it is very soft; an easy top to throw on, feel comfy, and look fantastic! i sure wish it was smaller :/
4 I ordered these in eptites, tey were a ltitle long still. also a tiny bit on the loose side. i am not sure i think they are worth as much as they cost, so wil lwait for hte sale. color combination was nice though,a dn the cut relatively flattering, i jsut ahve seen better out there for hte price. nice business/casual pant.
4 Super cute dress for fall. detail is much more intricate than what you are able to see online. not too long and will look perfect with tights and boots.
4 This sweater is heavier and has more of a swing shape to it than i had expected. but it is fitted enough at the top, that it still fit the bill. the pink is woven with a taupey color, and the effect is great. almost a little retro.
4 I love this top! i gave it a four star because i wish it were a tad longer. i am short... 5'-1 and it does work for me, but i do tend to like my tops longer. very cute and airy in the back!
4 Great fit with tight pants, beautiful flower design that goes with everything. favorite tshirt
4 Color and style was pretty but the sleeves were so long i had to return it. cuffing the sleeves wasn't an option because you would lose the cute piping detail and see the inside seam.
1 This sweater is the perfect sweater except for one thing.....it sheds everywhere. i can simply pick up the sweater and shake it in one hand and 40 large pieces of lint go everywhere on the ground and on you. if you like dark jeans- don't purchase. before i walked out of the store- the salesperson had to use a delineator on me- it was hysterical. sheds so much
4 Nice quality material. the green is pretty color. just a good cozy top. i normally wear a large in retailer clothes and the large in this world was very roomy (which was fine with me). if you are short and have smaller shoulders and bust definitely go for a size smaller than you would normally wear.
1 This sweater was not as featured in the picture. the front is completely cropped while the back is regular length. the front barely reached the middle of my stomach. also, the color was not as vibrant as shown in the picture. this sweater will be going back.
4 This top is gorgeous, but the sleeves are all wrong. they're very tight for about 5" at the bottom, right up to the elbow making it tight when i bend my arms. it's also loose in the armpit area, the bottom of the sleeve starts under my chest, and is styled that way, so i'm considering returning. i actually drove an hour to the nearest store to size up, but the sleeve feels even more tight. ugh! i love the quality & looks otherwise, and the front is double layered so no need to layer. the front i
4 I have this in black and red. it's a great and flattering dress that is a worn a bit large. you can wear it out on a date or more casual. the fabric is super comfortable as well.
4 - this really is lovely. the overall design from the arms, front, and back makes this poncho unique. it's not too thick, either, making it a nice everyday sort of thing. however, it just didn't work for me. even though i'm 5'9", ponchos have a tendency to
1 This blouse has too much drapey fabric and it's just not flattering.  in the front part of the blouse the fabric is relatively short, but the sleeves have so much excess fabric it almost looks like a clown suit.  sending back.
1 I wanted to love this dress because the fabric is fun, but i could not find a way to make the drawstring waist look like anything but a potato sack.the model has her hands hiding the lack of a waistline
4 I think i ordered this in an xxs because of the other reviews making it sound like it ran large. and i'm happy with the size and overall look of this tee on me. i'm 5'3" about 105 lbs and 34aa (i generally order xs or xspetite). the cuffs of the sleeves are pretty tight and the v-neck is higher than i'd like but otherwise i really like the loose, casual fit. there's no armhole seam, they're dolman sleeves. the tee i got translates to "the beautiful coast". it does say made in usa on the label. a
4 I purchased this on one of retailer's 40% off sales, and got it for a great price. if you're looking for a pretty, comfortable t-shirt that's a little beyond the basic, this fits the bill. unfortunately the neckline was just a tad wide for me in the xs. i felt like it might show a peek of my bra, and when i adjusted it higher, the soft, stretchy material showed bra lines underneath. that issue, and the fact that the shirt is on the flowy side made it less-than-flattering for my small frame, but i
4 Beautiful! color is true to pictures. no stretch. no liner. looks good with white or nude tank.
4 Ordered my usual size 28 in pilcro jeans but these are on the small side. fit is a little small in the waist area, & don't mean to be crude but the crotch area is on the short side for me. legs fit snug, & i have skinny legs! i'll have size up to a 29. the twisted seam look is really cute. 5'3" abt 118# - too much ice cream lately.
4 This dress is easy and attractive. it's very soft and just slips on, but looks very put together. on my shorter frame, it's a bit long, more midi length, but it's so comfortable and pretty, that i'm fine with it; it looks a little bit 20's that way. recommended.
4 This dress us high quality and feels great, however i am 5'5" and it is too long for me. will definitely need to shorten but love it, not above knee as pictured for a non supermodel!
4 Great soft tee. got the blue and really love the color.
4 Great transition into fall for layering. easy breezy dress up or down-is thin so it does need a cami
4 I tried this top on today because i was really hoping i could get the shorts and robe set. the shirt was softer than i was expecting, but when i tried it on it was an uncomfortable fit. there was some tightness in the armpit area, which is not where i would have expected it to be tight. the rest of it was comfortable and reasonable looseness so i don't think a size up would have been a good option for me. i like the design a lot so i was really disappointed it didn't fit. it is between a lightwe
4 I love my blue dress, i'm a pear shape to the top fit fine on me. i know reviewers complained that the top was too tight, not so on me. it was also not sheer on me because it has a cotton lining underneath. got a lot of compliments!
1 I am petite (5'). even the xsmall petite looked sloppy on me. i also disliked the nude fabric under the lace- it made it look cheap. i wanted this to be the perfect lbd, i  just couldn't make it work on my body.
4 This blazer is gorgeous. the brocade fabric is beautiful. the color is really a blueish purple/indigo. you can wear it with a black skirt/pants and even jeans. the only downside is that it runs about one size smaller than what it says it is.
4 I originally saw the sweater in one of the stores. it really is much nicer in person than online. i decided to try it on while there but was looking for other items, not sweaters then. i normally wear between xs and s depending on the brand. well, even the xs was too big. i thought i'd order it in a petite size since i am short but forgot about it once i got home with some other retailer items. i eventually did search it out but the xs petite was already sold out. i ordered the xxs?this fits but i
4 My daughter loves these, she wears them around the house all day when she doesn't have to go out.
4 Agree with other reviewers that the dress doesn't look like the picture so retailerpligie should really change it out. however i'm keeping the dress since it does look cute on. definitely more yellow in it than you can see.
4 I was very excited to get this piece, but it wasn't quite right for me. very well constructed and nice material, but the open sides were a bit too open toward the front. the top zipper was tough to do on your own.
4 I agree with the previous review that this dress runs large. otherwise, it is a lovely dress, though i added a belt since the tie wasn't defining enough for me. brown leather looks great with it and i get tons of complements.
1 There's a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views. it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse. the print is lovely but the fit is very odd. it's pulls at and is very tight through the bust too. i wear medium or large and ordered size large. if you're less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you. but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide. returned.
4 I just got this tank and love it. it has the perfect amount of swing, but does run a little large. the underlay was more yellow than i expected, but i think it adds a nice amount of brightness to the top. this will be a summer staple.
4 Gorgeous sweater - such a simple design, but really stunning on. seems to be true to size. definitely a nice winter piece that's got a hint of "dressy" to it - maybe for date night. my only wish is that it didn't flair so much at the bottom (wish it was a bit more straight) - but other than that, i love it.i'm approx 5' 5" and about 125 lbs. i purchased the "small".
1 I really wanted to like this dress. the color is perfect, the design and cut are cut (not always the case at retailer). however, the fabric quality was terrible - a shiny acrylic with cheap nylon lace. it looked like something from a discount store and had to go back.
4 I bought this dress for my sister's bridal shower, and it was a hit! i was a little bit surprised when it arrived because i did think it was going to be actual tweed - it is not. it is simply a tweed pattern! i think it makes a little bit more casual, but it was a fun dress for an afternoon bridal brunch! one thing i wish it had - pockets!!
4 I love the pattern and colors of this dress. the quality of the fabric is great. i initially ordered my usual size xs, but found it a bit roomy so i ordered both an xsp and an xxs. the xxs was more fitted and the xsp was too short in my opinion. i am still on the fence about the xs and the xxs. the xxs has a tighter fit, but it is also tight in the bust and i wonder how it will be if i have to reach for something - will it be too tight? even though the xs runs slightly big, i can still work with
4 I love these pants! i got the blue ones. i got a petite 25 and i am 115lbs 5.1.5' - they sit low on waste and hug curves just right. they are little bit long, maybe 1 inch too long. will wear with platform or thick squared heel.
4 This sweater was exactly what i was hoping for. it is true to size. it actually is cozy, which i love in the winter. the color is so pretty. the quality is good. it is fun and stylish. i do recommend it.
4 Wasn't sure whether i would like the top from the online picture, but it is so much more flattering in person. can be worn as a casual piece with denim skinnys or dressed up with a pencil skirt.
4 Cute sweatshirt with fun print. i bought it using retailer discount, and probably would not have paid full price for it. embroidery is a nice touch. i ordered an xs, which fits fine, but the overall design of the shirt is a little short and boxy. i did not realize until it arrived that the back of the shirt is a v neck. it's not a deep v, but it feels a little odd at first.
4 Fit was very tts.  it looks more lightweight in the photo than it is in person, it's a fairly medium weight sweater.  i'm 5'8 and curvy, and it is nowhere near as long on me in the front as it is on the model.  i still liked the look, mostly because of the look from the back of the shirt.
4 Got this today and am really pleased. beautiful detail and i love how the cowl neck hangs. it's not itchy at all. overall, a great find for the colder months ahead. i got a small and probably should have ordered xs  instead. runs a little big on my petite frame.
4 These are *almost* perfect. the fabric feels great, and it's a super cute print. the only downside is that the rise is really long and high. i wish they'd stocked more petities, because the petites are all sold out, and only the super long regulars are left at this time. if you are above 5'7", they'll be awesome on you. if you are below 5'4", you may be getting them altered.
1 This dress was a disappointment. not black, but brown. and it was very oddly made, with a weird, seam right across the belly. on its way back...
4 This vest is beautiful and exactly as shown in the model shot. it is soft, warm, and drapes beautifully...perfect length on my 5'7" frame. the leather detail along the edge is a nice high-quality touch. i will say that it is pretty itchy especially around the neck, but wearing a shirt with a collar like it is shown seems to help that issue. the dark color is navy in the print (not black)...overall i think this is gorgeous, but the full price feels a little ludicrous...i think i may wait until sa
4 This is my new favorite dress! my only complaint is the slip is too small and the dress cannot be worn without it. i can't order a size up as the dress would then be huge. not sure what the solution is but the dress itself is stunning.
4 This is a steal at the sale price. medium is large on me and i'm generally a large at retailer. so soft.
4 Another beautiful retailer top.  i ordered a small (5.4, 112 lbs, broad shoulders, athletic build) and it looked really large when i pulled it out of the package.  it's a bit large, but i wouldn't want it tighter through the bust (34c).  the colors are vibrant and the print is really beautiful.  although it can be hand-washed, i will be taking this to the cleaners to preserve the color! i love retailer because their clothing is so often  unique.
4 Based on other reviews i was hesitant to order, but i loved the colors and design in the blouse. it was on major sale so i took a chance and could not be more pleased. it is very sheer as other reviewers have noted so i was expecting that. i wear a cami under nearly everything so no problem for me. the colors are tdf and i can wear well into fall down here in south ms. there were a few strands of thread hanging from various seams but i gently clipped with scissors. if you are attracted to the to
4 Really interesting, beautiful colors. i found it to be short, even in the regular size (and i'm 5'1 with a short torso). wish the fit was slimmer, but i could see it working with jeans, or being stunning with a black ball skirt.
4 This fits tts.  it is body-hugging as shown on the model.  the knit is thin, soft with tons of stretch.  i bought the "navy" which is the color shown in the photo.  as you can see, it's not really navy.  it's a strange blue that's more like a faded dark mallard blue.  but, it's still blue.the sleeves are long on me. so you taller girls won't have issues.  the ruffles move and are so fun.  the fabric, however, is not finished off.  it's raw cut material, which is why i gave it 4 stars.
1 Cute and very soft, but the elastic wasn't sewn in right. i took them out of the wash and the waistband was a twisted mess. disappointing for more expensive loungewear.
4 Very comfortable and attractive pullover. not too long or bulky, although i find myself rolling the sleeves up to keep them out of the way!but it's a keeper
4 This is all around, a pretty feminine take on the white shirt- very cute! the dot pattern adds some drama without it being too over-board. this fit of this top is fairly generous (on me at least), but it doesn't have a lot of stretch. i could probably be either a s or xs, but took the xs to get more of a silhouette.
4 Lovely color and really nice fabric. not much form to the dress but will be lovely with a belt or jacket.
4 Rompers are usually tough for me. i am petite, especially on top (5'2", 110 lbs, 34a), but have a healthy butt and hips, which can make sizing difficult. in this romper, i tried a regular xs, and found the fit very flattering. the top was blouse-y on me, but not overly so, and the arm holes didn't gape, which is usually an issue for me with non-petite sizing. the elastic waistband is also great, as you can adjust it to hit you in a flattering spot and keep the shorts from being too short (which
1 I ordered the taupe version of this tee, which was a medium brown with black stripes. the fabric felt itchy and rough, and was pretty sheer for not being light colored. i didn't care for the fit, which was extremely boxy and wide; from the picture, i expected an a-line fit, but not a wide drop with webbed underarms. i ordered 2 sizes, and could have worn the smaller if i'd kept this tee. it runs on the larger side. what astounded me most was that both tees i ordered were sewn with completely cro
4 I tried this on, the fit was true to size, as far as no cup size goes (32dd, got xs, was ok). the pattern i like, and was totally fine on my pale skin, but think of it, i would not likely wear this without a tank or shirt... support seemed ok too, i do like the criss-cross detail in the abck. thinking about keeping it, but i jsut don't "need" it right this second... dilemma.caveat: not been tested in a workout, obviously, since i am not sure i will keep it (may chance it on sale).
4 This is a lovely sweater--unique, nicely made, though i found that it ran large for me. i was between a size xs and small, and neither one seemed just right so i ended up returning it. the small had the right length in the arms and torso, but was too wide in the torso and shoulders, and the xs was too short. bummer! also found that every single ivory one had stains or spots on them in my local store, not sure why. if i had been able to settle on the right size i probably would've kept it!
4 I love everything about this dress, but the bust area. the bottom is so light and flowey with the pleating. makes you want to twirl. the color is light but not as light as the photo. it does not wash me out. the problem is the bust. it has pleats that billow out near the armpit area, making you look top heavy. the bottom is slimming, the top make you look buxom. the v neck is also higher than i would like, which again adds to the fullness of the chest area. i am still debating keeping this or re
4 Love this little "throw on and feel comfortable all day" tee shirt
4 I love the layered look of this jacket. i got it in navy which matches everything. i think it's a little on the large side for me. i ordered a small. i'm 5'2" 130 lbs. super comfortable. the inner layer is very soft. once you wash it, the outside is soft too. i've already worn mine several times. happy.
4 This is a beautiful dress! i love the patterns, the beading and the texture. however, i have returned it (size medium - my usual size) and asked for an exchange up to a large (fingers crossed it will be available!) because the shoulders are very narrow. i am fairly tall (5'8") with an athletic build. the body fit was a bit tighter than i expected also but not really an issue. however, the shoulders were obviously tight making it look too small and uncomfortable. yikes! i sooooo love this dress a
1 I ordered this in both an extra small and a small... i found that there was a very big difference in the two sizes- the extra small was true to size and had a great width, but was shorter in length than i would've liked (if it shrunk at all, it would've been unwearable). the small was quite a jump in size and was a little wider than i liked, but i decided to keep that one. the top was very cute and comfortable when i wore it, however i just washed it once on delicate in cold water and when i
4 In both senses, it is pretty and big and pretty big. i ordered the xs as the xxs and xs petite were both out, and it is to big on me. i am usually xs petite or xs, if shorter. i definitely need xxs (petite or not).(115 lbs, 30 dd, 26-27 inch waist)that being said, it is really cute and fun and flirt, but not romantic flirty, just girl next door flirty.the navy and white stripes are classic, so will last over the seasons. the cut is flattering, i really love it, just not on me being that
4 Reference: 100#, 5'1, 32a... ordered size xs.  the suit is pretty.  under the neckline, where the two orange panels meet the white center panel, that corner puckers a bit.  this will not happen if you have a larger chest than my 32a or have a longer/broader torso so that the fabric can stretch out, thus pulling that merging area flat.  the sides (cut out) lays flat when you stand up straight and gapes when your turn/bend to the side.  i think this is expected.  the bottom section, on the back, c
1 Material is strange. triangle top is funky. this is just not awesome in any way.
4 As other reviews noted, this runs large--huge is more like it. it's great quality, but i'm wondering now if the s/m would take me through the third trimester of pregnancy (which is why i ordered a m/l). i'm 5'7", and if i were any less, i don't think this would work for me at all.
4 I ordered these in my typical size, 26, and they fit everywhere perfectly except the butt. for me, i found them to be too tight in that area. i went to the store and tried on the 27 and they were too big in the waist. i do recommend them though. they are well made, i loved the wash and the length was perfect. being 5'3" they came to the lower ankle and that was fine with me. give them a try, hopefully they work better for you.
1 Loved the look, fit and styling of this turtleneck. but dry clean only, you have to be kidding?
4 Love the length, cut, & placement of pockets. the stretch has positive & negative consequences, though. minuses: easily wrinkled, grow 2 sizes within the day. pluses: comfy, bendy, they're designed to be more of an active short, so the wrinkles & give are quite fine (they only stretch in unnoticeable areas). if we're to repurchase, i'd size down--but i love the bright color  & comfort so much i'm keeping these as is. (i'm a 6-8, should have purchased the 27's.)
4 This is a great transition piece. wear with jeans or dress it up with a cute skirt.
4 I ordered these without reading the previous reviews and i would have to agree with everything everyone has already said. these are the cutest cords i've seen in a long time! they're definitely skinny, bridging on way too skinny through the calves but i'm willing to stick it out. the thing that bugs me about them is how stinking short they are?? the description doesn't really mention that they're crops but at this length any ankle bootie is going to be too short. also, they aren't navy. they're
4 I am 5'3" and 115 lbs. i ordered 2 on a whim and i'm so happy i did because they're so flattering.
4 Really liked the color but the style was too cropped and boxy for me. this sweater was short, wide and unflattering. however, i like this designer so i ordered another style with a different silhouette.
4 This dress is quite lovely in person, but it runs very small, particularly in the bust. i'm usually okay with a large in retailer dresses (sometimes medium), but i had a hard time getting into this, and the top was literally about 10" from being able to zip up. granted, i have a larger than average bust, but that's still excessive, and the fabric has no give whatsoever.the online pictures are pretty accurate representations in terms of look and shape. i think it would probably be best for pear s
4 Be aware that this cardigan runs small- as you can see on the model, it's a form-fitting style. it's not the kind of cardigan you would unbutton and take on and off as a layering piece. i would wear it more like a top with a button-up front. it is nice and soft and the black and white scalloped design is attractive. i would recommend it if you are looking for a more fitted top with this design. i'm not wow-ed by it, but it's nice in a 50's kind of way.
4 The fox print is super cute and the reason i ordered the skirt.  sizing was true to me, i'm usually an 8 and the 8 fit fine.  the waist is high and if you try to wear it low the side zipper puckers  out in a weird way.  skirt length is above knee (i'm 5' 6").  skirt is lined but the lining is dark brown/black same as the waist band in the photo of the model wearing it.  the lining does not show at the hem, it's concealed.  overall a fun a-line swingy skirt for late summer that will go into fall
4 This is a beautiful dress, considering it is made from polyester. that being said, the material has a nice finish and looks like it could be silk. it's a flattering cut (other than being a tad short-waisted) and hangs well. it was also a bit tight through the bust. unfortunately, if you are on the taller side, it tends to be high waisted and short in length.my daughter is 5'11" and a size 10. the medium fit best, although because of the length, she is reluctantly returning it. sad, because it ha
4 I saw this top in my local store and almost didn't try it on solely because i hate split-sleeve/cold-shoulder tops. but, the peplum style and pattern were so cute that i took it into the dressing room anyway. after trying on probably 6-8 items, i wound up buying this top and one other. i really like the fit, as i am high-waisted, and it defines my waist really well . the wide neck is also super flattering. and i love the pattern. i went ahead and purchased, despite the fact that i wasn't thrille
4 1. i've been waiting forever for these to finally arrive. i was a bit disappointed.2. i'm 5'5" tall, 145 lbs, and 38-32-40. my normal size 30's fit me perfectly, if a bit loose. they fit a lot like the hyphens.3. the legs are short and wide. they hit me at the ankle, which made them look like high waters on me.4. the legs are very, very wide, and i didn't think that was flattering on me.5. same comfy fabric and fit as the hyphens, except the front seemed to dip low at the waist i
4 I had been eyeballing this for a very long time because i loved the look of the skirt and this top (of which i snagged the skirt when it went on sale). i was delighted to finally take a chance and buy this when it went on sale, too. thoughts below:______pros:- it is well made and on the thicker side. - for a peplum, it is actually slimming. i am an hourglass and with hips, which usually means such tops flare out so much making me look wider in all the wrong places. so i was skeptical abo
4 The color and fabric are really soft and lovely. it runs big so you can get away with a size smaller of even 2 sizes smaller. it would look great paired with leggings and boots and a long sweater coat or with skinny jeans and sandals. this is going to be my new favorite.
1 I was interested in this sweater because i actually thought it was a tunic. the sweater is much shorter than i thought. i wish i could return it. i bought a size large which is my normal size.
4 I agree with the other reviews - great dress. i got a ton of compliments on it, but i had to take it to a tailor to get it taken in. not a fan of belts with dresses, but definitely wanted it so had quite a bit taken in. not sure why this seems to be a reoccurring issue with retailer. i was bummed i had to spend money to get the dress to look even somewhat like the photo.
4 I was looking for a cross between a light, fall-wool jacket and a cardigan and this is it! the red version looks festive in the winter, and the hood adds a bit of spunk. looks great both open and buttoned. i received many compliments on this the first time i wore it.
4 The front material is soft and cozy, but i was surprised to find that the back and the arms were a waffle knit, like long john material, very thin and tight in the arms. cannot wear a shirt underneath it, only tank top. other than that, it's a great deal
4 Great looking casual dress, but i'm not sure about the fit on me. the skirt drape may be a tad overwhelming on my short legs if i want to emulate the styling of the green model. bodice fabric is a nice, clingy but lined stretch material of medium thickness. the skirt is a thin crepe viscose/rayon without a lining and i think it really needs one. i was hoping the skirt was the same material mix like the elysian maxi. i picked the medium petite and sizing down would be appropriate for ladies with
4 I was excited to see this dress as i'd bought the sparrow boiled wool sheath dress in xs last year and loved the fit. however, this dress does not fit the same way. the top fits fine, but the waist and the bottom are way too big. i laid it over my sparrow dress from last year, and the bottom is at least an inch wider (two inches, if you go by the total circumference). i'm planning to exchange for an xxs and see if that one fits better.
4 Really cute dress -- the lace-up detail is distinctive, and i think this dress will be versatile. great for hot weather, but i tried it on with retailer skinny pants, and that looked cool too. the included slip (not a lining) is soft and not clingy. i'm on the petite size and often find that relaxed-fit dresses like this make me look like i'm wearing a sack, but this one is not too billowy or shapeless. i tried the mango color on in the store, and really wanted to buy it, but the color just is not
4 I love cloth & stone clothes and have this version in a long sleeved shirt. it is a little boxy, but the weight of the fabric helps with hang of it. i love the feel of the fabric and the weight of it for a summer dress, yet it is too sheer for a summer dress. it needs a liner or little cami dress to wear under it to keep it from being see through, however, for a texas summer, that defeats the point of a loose, easy dress to throw on. i sadly sent mine back.
4 I bought the holly color which appears almost granite/slate color in natural light. overall, great transitional sweater piece for fall. i'm considering exchanging it for an xs since the s seems a bit large. comfy/cozy yet breathable.
1 This dress was very boxy and unflattering. i really wanted to like it because the blue and white details were so pretty but it had to go back.
1 These are light and airy and pretty. they also tore the third time i wore them and not on a seam - a little above the knee while i was lying in my bed.they also do not slim the figure and the fabric is slightly see-through as it is so thin, therefore if you are looking for serious lounge pants - great - i would not leave the house in them... or turn over in bed in them.when i sit, the slits fall down around my thighs. my son complimented my dress the other day because the slits give way
1 I had hoped this bulky knit would be cuddly and soft, with suri (a type of alpaca) in the title. i don't know if the blend (45% polyamide, 25% royal baby alpaca, 20% fine merino) threw it, but had i felt this in store, i would never have even picked it up. unimpressed.
4 This is a comfortable cardigan in a versatile color palette. size small fits a little snug in the shoulder area but other wise true to size. fabric is soft. great quality for the price!
4 Has it been 5 years already. i too bought this 5 years ago. it peels and doesn't close but the horses make up for that. very very warm.
4 Intrepid soul that i am, i washed it in the machine in cold water on a 25 minute cycle, then put it in the dryer for 8 minutes, shook it out, hung it up, and it is just the same as when it went in. doesn't need to be ironed and didn't shrink. yes, the swing is vast, but that is part of its charm. pair it with a fitted piece on the bottom and no one will think that you are actually needing that much material to cover anything! i think it is fun, something i will use for years, wonderfully comfort
1 I bought this shirt in a l, since i didn't want it to be too fitted and was concerned a m would be. it is so boxy! it's like a completely different shirt. i have no idea how it looks good on anyone, unless it is simply widened the larger the size. maybe a m wouldn't be as wide and therefore as boxy, but this shirt is just a bad mess. returning.
4 This top is lovely and so perfect for this time of year when you want to look fall-ish but when it's still too hot to wear long sleeves. but i'm pretty sure it's navy, not black. very dark navy, yes. still, not black. compared to every other black top in my closet it looks navy. so that was a little disappointing. but i'm keeping it because i'm a sucker for a flowy top, and i can wear it right now.
4 I love this brand! they produced a number of incredibly cute blouses in 2006-2010 and i've missed their quirky designs. this shirt does not run small. i am usually a 6 and have a little extra room in the chest area, even though i'm a 34dd. the arms are the perfect length as well which is nice as i have long arms. the only reason i did not give it five stars is that i wish it was a bit more fitted through the stomach area. its very billowy. i may take it to the tailor... so cute though! on a side
1 I love the idea of this top and ordered it in white. it is a great design and proportion is nice with jeans. the front is off white t shirt material with a pocket and the back is a light grey heathered panel. i am returning it as it is very thin and the quality is cheap looking. if the grade of material had been a bit thicker and better made, then it would have been a winner!
1 Horrible fit not true to size again aline outside of the dress and a very tight camisole underneath
4 I really like the warmth and loose cut of this sweater. it is great for layering and looks nice dressed up or down. my only gripe is i would love for it to have a second fastening. if it had another snap a little further down the body you keep keep it more securely closed. other than that it was a really great purchase.
1 I thought it would be heavier than it is. it's thin and more delicate than what i would expect for a winter sweater (it contains wool so not really suitable for spring/summer). it's also shorter than it appears on the model and a little wider/boxier too.
4 Cute, comfortable, easy to wear, even on my hourglass figure. can't decide the best shoes to wear with this - so it doesn't look frumpy.
4 I'll start this by saying i usually wear a m or l depending on the shirt. i'm 20 weeks pregnant and ordered a medium. it's huge! i was thinking i would be able to wear this for a bit while preggo and then would be able to wear it after baby with no problem. i'm going to order a small because the fabric is so soft and i love the design and color.
4 I like this on the model so i ordered it. it is not quite as deep in color as online but still pretty. it fits well not too loose and not tight at all. i will get great use out of this all the way through spring!
4 The bright poppy red is gorgeous and the cut flattering and interesting. i'm usually between a m and l in tops but went with a s in this one because it looked too sloppy in my usual size. i'm a 32-34 d with arms that aren't tiny, and it's a bit tight across the shoulders when i reach forward but not enough to be a problem. in the smaller size it skims my hips nicely but isn't as long as pictured on the model. i would suggest pear-shaped girls size down if in-between. it is sheer but not so much
4 I like this dress because it has a 60's vibe. however, if this swing style is too long, it just looks dowdy. this dress was too long, so i shortened and redeemed mine. i am 5'3 1/2" and 120 lbs. this style looks best on me just above the kneecap. if you try it on and hate it, it's probably because it's too long. in the winter i wear this with a long sweater (knee length) with a waistband in it to give it shape and with boots. the dress is lined but it is very, very sheer and requires a slip. or,
4 This ia very pretty dress. however, it is a unique design. i like the design of the dress, but i can see where some may not. i can't see a younger person wearing this. it is more for an older woman. the dress is so soft, does wrinkle easily, but just a beautiful pattern and comfortable. i can see some of my friends thinking this is too much like a nightgown, but i really love this dress!
4 These days i am more like a 6 after gaining some weight. when i was in my local retailer the other day i happened upon this dress only in a small/petite. i tried it on and it actually fit me very well. i am 5 foot 6 so i thought the petite might be too short or wouldn't work, but surprisingly it fit my body type. i think i'll like wearing it best with a pair of wedges or heels. like most other reviews i'm inclined to agree that the regular size has too much fabric going on and probably is s
4 This shirt is amazingly soft and has such a great cut, especially for me being curvy. i love to pair this with cute leggings or tight ankle jeans with my boots. recently wore on a casual date with the hubby and he loved it paired with my dark brown leather jacket and dark jeans. only reason i gave it 4 stars was that the shirt tends to stretch out a little at the bottom is seems as you wear it throughout the day - it is still a great shirt and if possible i would buy more. need to bring
4 This is a beautiful, flattering dress, however i can't decide whether to keep it or not! as a few other reviewers has mentioned, the transition between the "top" and the "skirt" is a bit off - it's like there is some extra fabric there, and the weight of the skirt pulls it down, making it a little awkward/bunchy. i thought it may have been showing up because i am larger chested (36d), but you can kind of see this on the teal dress image, under the chest where there is an extra fold. i ordered th
4 This top is really pretty and i received a lot of compliments on it. i said it ran true to size, but really the torso part runs a little big. if i had sized down, i think it would have been too tight in the arms. the cami that came with it kept falling out, which is no big deal, but be aware that the strings might not hold the cami with the shirt. overall, it's a really pretty blue and the details make it worth it.
4 These are beautiful and very comfy. they do run very large. i ordered the green in medium and deciding wether to exchange for a small. the washing instructions in the pants are to dry clean for best results. the description needs to be updated to reflect this.
1 This top doesn't at all fit like it does on the model. the mid section is very wide and boxy and the material is thick and almost sweatshirt-like. i typically wear size small or 4, but perhaps an xs might've fit or looked better. sadly i must return this shirt.
1 Really well made. beautiful. sadly it is very short. not a tunic at all.
4 I really love this shirt! i ordered the orange and am considering getting the other color too. it's very comfortable and cute. i got a lot of compliments when i wore it. this shirt definitely runs large and i had to exchange the medium for a small. the looser cut makes it very easy for this to look like a maternity shirt, so i'd advise everyone to size down.
1 I loved the look of this dress online, so i was excited to order it, but when it arrived i found it was not at all how i expected it to be. i thought the material would be more lacy, but it seemed pretty cheap. there was also some boning at the waist which is nice in theory, but it made the material poof out just under the waist, making me look like i had a belly. no matter what i did i could not get it to lay flat. returned to the store and bought the embroidered perennial dress instead, which
4 I bought this for a swim suit cover up and i'm very happy with it. the fabric is thin and rather sheer, i wouldn't buy it to wear it outside as a regular dress. i'm 5'6" and the front of the dress hits me above the knees. the fabric is soft and comfy. the blue with white piping is pretty and the fit is flattering. i'm really happy with this dress.
4 Tried them on in store. they were actually kind of sexy on. i have an hourglass figure and the way that these fit, felt sort of like a 50's/60's fit, accentuating and flattering my shape. on my to get list.
4 Really cute tee... charcoal is deep and great all seasons. cut high on sides... may need to size up to accommodate - depends on body shape. tried the white, didn't buy--- too lightweight, but could work layered.
4 I was excited when i saw these shorts in my local retailer store. i wear a 25 sometimes 26 and i grabbed an xs. however, when i tried these shorts on i was sad to see that they run big and looked baggy on me. they fit, but are really loose. i am probably going to have to return these because they don't come in an xxs. they are great shorts and a perfect length, but make sure you size down.
4 Fit is "breezy" which is what i expected. a little on the loose side but comfortable and still cute. the slip that accompanies the dress is of decent quality as well.  the back of the dress is not that much longer than the front, as in the picture, but i still liked the dress enough to keep it.
1 The small, zipped and laid flat, measures 16" across at the bottom of the armholes, 11" at the waist and 18" from shoulder seam to bottom edge. it's too small for a size 0, and not by just a little! too bad, because it really is very pretty.
4 I ordered ths thinking it was likea blazer, but it is soft and not structured, like a t-shirt. however, it is rather flattering on. i had a har dtime deciding whether to keep it. the regular size was fine on me, i usually require peites, but this doesn't come in petites, and it was really nice with the fitted cowl shirt i was wearing. i am definitely putting it back in my wish list (as i did end up returning).
4 This top has slightly more of a burnout effect than i realized. i like it and its great for layering, but you must wear something underneath as it is quite sheer.
4 I ordered the gray/plum colorway and while i'm disappointed in the large percent acrylic fabrication, the vest is very soft and warm. the unfinished raw seams add visual interest and i'm tempted to remove all the care tags and wear this inside out for a different look. i am worried that excess pilling will be an issue so i will update my review if the quality deteriorates beyond a simple lint shave.
4 I like this top. it is a nice casual top. i think it looks better on the model because it looks a bit dressy. when i tried it on, it looked good but not as dressy. the embroidery on the side gives the top a nice look. i also like the tie-dye look. the price is high, i got it on sale price. the fabric is a simple t-shirt, the embroidery makes it stand out. i am keeping it.
4 I tried this on in gray while in store, it was the cuff detailing that initially attracted me. once i tried it on there wasn't a lot i loved about it so it didn't leave with me but now that it's on sale, it's the perfect choice. i'm wearing a medium in the photo, and the only real downfall is how long the arms are on me and i have long arms. maybe sizing down would help but i fear i have too much winter weight to hide to take a small. for reference, i'm 5'6", 145 lbs curvy hourglass, generous hi
4 These are form fitting and have a great wash. the size runs large so i would say consider to go down one size than you usually wear. the bottom tapers so they are great to wear wtih flats or can easily fit into boots.
4 I ordered this dress and wow , this is one really pretty dress, my only drawback is that the dress is not fully lined. for this price i was expecting a full lined dress. the flower detail and beading is amazing, but this one is going back hopefully it will be on sale soon, i might reconsider
1 So disappointed. i love retailer! this was a huge disappointment. i am 5'3" and 120 pounds. when i put it on, all i could think was that i looked just like a clown due to the big cowl neck and how large and round the dress made me look. if i wasn't so disappointed, i might have laughed. this had to have been a design mistake. i've truly never seen something so unflattering.
1 I ordered this skirt because it looked cute and versatile. when it arrived the pleat in front (shown in the center) was far to the right so the overall look was crooked. not sure if it was a quality control issue or if that's the true design but it will have to go back. too bad because i had high hopes!
1 Bought this shirt on sale. it was super cute in the dressing room, and for the first time i wore it. washed it per the instructions (wash delicate with cold water, lay flat to dry) and it shrunk so much i don't think i'm going to be able to wear it anymore. it was oversized and loose when i bought it, so it shrunk a lot. there is also a small hole all of the sudden, that i have no idea where it came from (wasn't there when i put it in the washer). very disappointed.
4 I'm 10mths post partum so my belly is still flabby. the elastic is too tight on my waist. i wish this was looser with a drawstring to tighten. i have to return it.
4 I saw this dress in the store, there are actually two different colors for this dress: one is blue/purple/silver, the other one is orange/tan/gold. both of them look very nice in person, especially with the shimmery thread. i tried on the blue/purple/silver one and i found it runs large. for reference, i am 5'2", 34b, 120 lbs, usually wearing a size s or sp in retailer dresses, i found size xs fits me better in this design. the material of this dress drapes nicely, but it is kind of itchy,
4 Not a summer dress even though the photos make it seem like it's for hot weather. the weight and layers and synthetic fabric is very substantial. it is a bit scratchy where there is maroon fabric, but not intolerable. i love this dress but it's beyond a-line, it's a tent. i'm keeping and will wear for fall with a long sweater to flatten the fullness that's seen in profile. for my body type (top heavy, thick shoulders/back/upper arms), i chose the smaller of my size range. definitely size down if
4 Unfortunately had to return this. i loved it but just doesn't work for my petite size.
4 The fabric making this dress is great quality- heavyweight and so soft against the skin. the design is near perfect with an extraordinarily flattering silhouette that hangs just right from the hips with poof or flare. the fateful flaw is in the neckline; a broad boat shape that looks awkward couples with a corset-like torso that acts as a push up bra. not for larger busted woman (34d here) and certainly not suitable for work.
4 Falls nicely. pretty peachy pink color. darker than pictured. bought sz l, 5'8" 175lbs, am busty. very nice fabric, prone to wrinkles.
4 I saw this in the store a few weeks back and desperately wanted it. when it wet on sale, i grabbed it! i normally wear an xs or petite s, but with this one, the petite m was the winner! i am chesty and the top would not have zipped up had i gone any smaller. it is a bit wide on the bottom, and i agree with the reviewer who said it should be a bit more tailored on the bottom. still, with some awesome heels, this is a great summer piece! the lining is great quality. love it!
4 These tights are light but at the same time super cozy. definitely cut and sewn as tights and not meant to be worn as leggings -- they're really sheer around your rump. i've worn them around the house with oversized t-shirts and long sweaters. would only wear out of the house with a dress or serious coverage, despite what i thought when i bought them. i wish they were available in a few more colors. worth the sale price.
4 Tried in store today and found to fit tts. images are accurate in terms of color and showing that there is a tiny bit of sheerness to this (as you can see near the bottom in each photo). i really loved everything about it except that it flared out a bit on the bottom in a way that i'd probably fuss with too much. id probably buy it on sale, but not before that.
4 I chose to ignore the other reviews saying this shirt was too wide thinking that my wider shoulders would fill it out, but that's not the case. the shirt is adorable and soft and cute on, but just too wide around the armpit/chest area and with the horizontal stripes it just didn't look attractive. i would love to try the next size down to see if it works, but the black and white xxs is sold out so back it went. i am only 5'4" with a shorter torso so the length was fine for me.
1 I loved the design and look to this shirt, but it ran way big for me. i loved the forgiving fit, but it just wasn't flattering at all. i even went down one size and it still was huge. sad to send this one back.
1 The top i received was large, really long in length, pockets in the front along the seam, and lots of volume in the back without any princess seams to give it shape. the id #'s matched, but that's about it. returned!
4 I love the deep v - very flattering. bummed that it's made with polyester, but it's light and easy.
4 Like other reviewers, i tried on a medium and a large as i usually take either size in retailer dresses. the large was huge on me - i had an extra 6 inches or so on each side. the next medium that i tried on could barely fit over my head! i looked at the tag to see if i had picked up an extra small but it stated medium. got another medium and it fit perfectly. however, the cami underneath one medium was again teeny tiny. the other medium was ok. you may have to try on a few dresses to get the righ
4 I ordered this in the blue motif and the print is really fun. the orange is even brighter in person. at 5'8" 130 lbs the small has more than enough room and is a bit longer than some of the other offerings lately.
4 Easy breezy top that goes with so many outfits. i am petite (5'0'', 115lb), but like the longer look of a top, so went with 4r, thought that the arm holes would be too small if went with 2r. there is a lot of excess material around the sides...and back. i was tempted to return, but the armhole issue prevented me and it was so cute, i kept it. i think it will go through the a few seasons (seattle is unpredictable weather-wise...) and can be easily layered. i like the blouse...but don't love.
4 Love the nautical vibe, perfect for summer wear. the knit top with cap sleeves is easy to wear and not clingy for those with limps and bumps. the asymmetrical skirt has a flare which again makes this dress easy and comfortable to wear.  i'm usually a size 8, 36-29-40 and the medium fit my hourglass shape perfectly.
4 I don't have anything like these pants so was thrilled to purchase the coral. i found the pants ran slightly large, though i stuck with my regular 28" and they are very comfortable.
4 This green dress seemed more fitted and tailored on the model. i ordered a small and medium in the green and mint (even though it says mint, it's a grayish blue). usually i'm a medium but even the small seems a bit big. it fits more like a loose boho dress rather than how the model wears it. the colors are vibrant and the embroidery is nice. i will be keeping both colors in small and just have to accept that the fit is similar to a looser casual summer dress. if you look at the pics that other c
4 This is very cute and well-made, but unfortunately for my coloring and hair, washed me out a bit. the attention to detail is fabulous and it is a great layering piece for spring. tts but definitely longer as is shown in picture on model.
4 This was such an adorable print that even though it was a bit pricey i decided to splurge! alas, the fit just wasn't good. it didn't look good on me and bunched up in all the wrong places. sadly, i had to return it. i've bought swimsuits from seafolly before and recommend the brand due to the high quality, unfortunately this particular style just didn't look that good on me.
4 I just received this in the mail today! fabric and construction are beautiful and high quality. my only concern was that it ran short on me all around. i am 5'2, 100lbs, 32b, 24 waist, 33 hips. the dress was an appropriate length all around but ran very short in the arm holes, the back cut-out, and the waist. i felt like i was trying to wear a little-girl's dress (and i tend to be short waisted and long-legged as is). i may exchange it for a regular size because it is such a beautiful dress!
4 Really soft and roomy. very comfortable. just hope it washes well. nice alternative to the regular turtleneck. i wanted it in both colors neutral and green. unfortunately, the neutral did not work for me.
4 I saw this skirt online and had to have it. as another reviewer mentioned, the color is more of a yellowy ivory. the skirt is very pretty, but also has a very thick/heavy satin polyester lining. i don't feel like i could wear it during the summer because the thick poly lining wouldn't breathe. that was the deciding factor and sadly i'll have to return it.
4 This is a beautiful swim suit! the overall look is lovely; the ruffle is sweet and the low-cut front keeps it just the right amount of sexy for a one piece. i didn't keep it only because i would have preferred the leg opening to be cut a little higher. otherwise, it fit very well. i'm 5'10" and 150, with broad shoulders and a substantial rack (nursing a baby right now) and i didn't have any problems with support. great buy!
4 I bought this top in two colors because i need more statement tops and thought the colors were different enough for a really great top. i have only worn the ivory so far and love it. comfortable, great style and solid quality so the fringe isn't fraying or falling out.if i could change one thing it would be the itchiness around the neck opening. it's not horrible but it can be distracting and mildly uncomfortable.i am really happy with the tops and can't wait to start wearing the black one t
4 I tried this on in store after falling in love with it on the rack. the dress is beautifully designed and has elegant, subtle features. i am normally a 2-4 in retailer dresses, but the 0 was the closest fit on me. unfortunately, this dress fit very strangely. the waist on the dress was way above my actual waist, which was unusual given i have a very short torso. it also had a strange fold right around my belly button, which was very distracting. i'll put this all down to my extremely straight and
1 I bought this online so didn't realize that the fabric at the bottom is very, very stiff. i was expecting something silky, or at least on the softer and more moveable side. the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt. that being the case, it kind of juts out in weird places. the sweater part is very nice, but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture. the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o
4 I tried this on in a m - it fit tts aside from the fact that there were super long. very form fitted and flattering.
4 Bought this in white and the golden embroidery makes this piece very elegant looking. it is a bit sheer, but with a lace bra definitely very nice. that is the only con, i wish it would be not sheer at all. but it is too beautiful to send it back for that reason.
4 I love the feel and quality of this sweatshirt. however, because of the embroidery/lace detail on the shoulders, it makes it a little stiff so the shoulders look slightly boxy.
4 These jeans are very comfortable. the distress look is enough but not too much, so it is a nice change to the traditional jeans without looking too worn down.
4 My wardrobe craves lush detail-rich dresses like this beautiful maxi.  knowing that the dress is expensive and made of all synthetic fabric, i took the plunge and purchased the largest of my size range.  i've noticed that most indian labels commissioned by retailer fit tighter in my chest/shoulders, so i'm glad i trusted my instincts and bought the 12p as it fits perfectly on my 36dd chest and wide shoulders.  this is not a casual dress--there are sequins, beads and rosettes decorating the bodice.
4 I really like this top. i am usually a medium in retailer clothing and so i ordered this in medium. it did not fit right across my chest, the empire part cut right across my breast and not underneath like it is supposed to. i returned the top for a large and it fits just right in that area. other than that this top is light and airy, flowy and pretty. i love it!
4 I ordered the blue top. it's great for the hot summer we're having in the southeast this year.
4 I was happy to see this top come back after being sold out. the cream is a pretty color....not too warm toned. the cut is true to size, although very fitted in the arm hole area. the sleeves rather fitted. the fabric of the sleeves is fairly fragile but should be doable if not overly worn. the chest fitted with an aline cut. rather loser in the back. it is also somewhat see through, although not as bad as some i have tried. overall it's a really great top, but would need to be worn with care. gr
4 Great, special cardigan. fits like a shrug and a little short but is perfect over a tight fitting sheath. great for broad shoulders.
4 I am tall (5'11 and 3/4) and mostly leg with a shorter torso so i am always looking for longer shirts to balance my leg to torso ratio. i ordered this in the tan and blue colors in a large and so far have loved both of them. i am typically a medium in tops but tend to get the large for the extra length and have the top altered to fit if need be. however there was no need to alter these tops (making me think the tops typically run small). both tops are sheer requiring a tank of some sort to b
4 Lovely sweater that is good with jeans or a skirt. i ordered an xl and my only complaint is that i wish it were a bit longer in the front. i am heavy chested though so that's how most tops fit me. i ordered the gray/black and it's really nice. i receive lots of compliments.
4 The embroidery and side zip were well constructed. the fabric holds onto wrinkles and creases, so after a period of sitting, there are several creases pointing to one's crotch area. this isn't too noticeable, but definitely makes this a more informal garment.
4 I love the desi blouse! i got it in white and it's a little more off white than pure white, but it is a great flowy top. the touch of lace across the bust is a nice accent. the only down fall is that the sleeves are a bit puffy, but the rest of the top makes up for that.
4 This is a wonderful layering piece for the office. the material is so soft, like a thick velvet, but not quite. it is cute with a sleeveless body skimming top underneath, b/c it fits loosely. not for 90 degree days, as it is a bit of a heavier summer material. the orange-peach-coral color is really unique!
4 These run small in the thighs and behind just like most of the other cartonnier pants. i have four pair of cartonnier pants that are all size 10...which is a size or two up from my usual 6 or 8 in other styles. print is great! fabric is super lightweight and great for summer.
4 I really wanted to like this dress on me, but it was not to be. the color is one of my favorites, but the dress accented all my problem areas. sadly, i returned it. i'm sure that someone with less substantial hips will look great in it.
4 I found this to be a comfortable, stylish, no-fuss look. bought my normal size 4 (5'7", 128#) in the orange, and it fits like the model. it's a nice lightweight linen and is machine washable, which is always a plus. you can't tell from the photo, but the lace-up portion actually has a bit of fabric in it, so you aren't revealed if it isn't tightly laced ;)
4 I found this to fit tts. i sometimes wear petite, but found the petite sizing to be a little off. i have a pretty short torso, but found the petite to be too short. i opted for the regular sizing and got a 6; it fits great. this top is great for work (styled with a cardigan or blazer) or for play. i can see it dressing up or down very easily.
4 Out 6 items i purchased online, this is only one that made the cut. it's super soft and cute on. the only thing i didn't like was the cute lining is attached by buttons, but it needs more attachment points to keep it from showing. i'm going to fix that myself, but i hate sewing things that i purchase. so it lost a star for that.
4 Super flattering fit. i am generally a large, large, and the medium of this shirt fit really well. the drape of the fabric was very forgiving of my tummy. great look. also my 1 year old son loves the colors and flowers!
4 This swing dress is very cute and easy to wear. i ordered the orange print and the black because i couldn't decide. the orange looked washed out against my skin color but the black was a keeper. i am usually a small but ordered one in the small and one in the extra small since it is a swing dress and they usually run large. the top is mostly the same fit so i think i may keep the extra small. even still there is a lot of extra fabric. the rayon is a little on the cheap side but it is so comforta
4 I'm not petite, but i am short at 5'3 and while these fit in all the right places, the leggings are about 5-6 inches too long. i'm still deciding whether to return or hem - but the hemming would have to be professionally done with this material. bummer.
4 This shirt is incredibly comfortable. the material is so soft, and it fits so well. i am 5'6" and 130 lbs with a 32b chest and i purchased a small - it is large on me, and i would have preferred an xs, but the small is just fine as well! it is a great shirt, especially for an oversized henley. 100% recommend. (one star off for the larger sizing.)
4 I originally bought this for myself but it was way too big on my backside since i don't have much "junk in the trunk." i decided to pass it on to my sister since it was just too pretty to return. it fits her much better and she's worn it on a few occasions. it does run larger and the pants are very long. definitely have to be either hemmed or always worn with heels.
4 This was about to be my first retailer splurge item, but i think i'm not there yet. for the rich price tag, these pants weren't going to be versatile enough for me. they're very light weight and even translucent in sunlight. perfect for a small subset of my days but not going to make the cut for casual friday. that light patch near the r knee is also a pocket- tended to flap open and look about as nonsensical as it is. if you're already on this level good for you! i had to send these back.
4 This dress is flattering, but size up. tight through chest in my normal size.
4 I wish these fit more like joggers, but they are slightly poofier. with the big buttons, i felt a bit too clownish. however, it's a great statement piece if you're up for it. the quality is good and the fabric has a nice texture. i think the problem was that since linen doesn't drape and scrunch like less structured fabrics, so it holds more volume instead of loose, semi-flowy menswear look. i
4 Just tried 'layered sadie top' and it felt so nice on. good hand feel for both materials but note that the knit on top is a little too delicate for machine wash but can be hand washed. this item is definitely "vanity-sized". i'm 5'1, 113lbs and the xs looked nothing like how it does on the model. it was flowy as depicted but it came down much lower on me and looked a little maternity-esque. highly recommend because it's gorgeous and well made but i would definitely come in and try it out for you
4 I normally am a xl or size 18 in fabric tops (if they're not knit and do not stretch.) but, this looked to be a bit boxy and so i bought the 16 and it fit fine. it fit like on the model....tailored, but loose and not really a lot of fabric or boxy.now, the fabric is stiff. and, it's sheer. but, the pockets land where your breasts are. so, i wore this with a nude bra and it's just like in the photo. there are peeks but you don't see anything. however, if this is for work, i'd put a cami under
4 Great summer pants.....nice material, easy to take care of. i'm 5'6" and usually wear a size 29, which i purchased the neutral. they might be a little bit loose, but they fit great, and best of all, they truly are slimming. i love them so much that i just ordered the green.......hard to top the sale price
4 I purchased the cedar one. not sure where they got color name from since i don't see any cedar in it. the picture of the model is accurate in coloring and fit. tts, the sleeves are a little wider and longer at bottom but in a good way (to me). the pockets and belt are a suede-like material which makes for a lovely detail. it's not a slender-izing piece but not a frumpy fit imo at all. soft material and nicely made, but for that price i would hope so.
4 This is a classic pencil dress that would be becoming on most straight figures. i always wear a 6 (or medium) in hd, and this dress is a little large everywhere. i love it so much, i paid full price and i will probably have it taken in on the sides if possible. the lacework is gorgeous and sturdy - it doesn't catch on stuff. there is a lot of give to sit and move in, unlike most pencil dresses, and i cannot say enough about the color. wow, heads turn when you walk into a room in this gorgeous de
4 I purchased this top in the wine color and found it to be cute and comfortable. the sleeves are not tight which is nice, but it is very short and moving your arms away from our sides make this shirt look a little bit like a tent. the color is pretty and the button detail is nice.overall good purchase, but i'm glad i got it on sale!
4 This top is my fun splurge for the summer. it's a little flowy but not over the top. and the quality is great. i'm 5"7, 120lb with really broad swimmer shoulders. i preferred the xs because it was a little bit less flowy on the sides than the s. but the length on the xs is dramatically shorter than s, so i went with the s.
4 The materical is wonderful and light and the color is gorgeous, but the large was absolute gigantic. i'm returning it and sizing down possible to a small, which is unreal, since i wear a size ten normally! i am petite, height-wise, but more than length, there was just so much room width-wise. it swallowed me! the dress itself is lovely, though, so i'm definitely exchanging for a more reasonable size. but definitely size down!
4 Super cute and flattering!
4 I loved this dress and i really loved it more after i bought it on sale. i am 5'3 100lbs and the only thing that bothers me is that the arm of it are somewhat tight when i reach out to get something. other wise the dress is great and get a lot of compliments on it. i paired it with black nylons and black plain leather booties and it looked great!
4 First, this is thermal ,so naturally i didn't expect super sheer, but it is. really sheer light fabric. i like it, but be prepared for considering who you might run into if you walk around the house in it. second, it is large. i ordered the size 0 and it's a nice oversized fit for my 5'3" 125 pounds. i wouldn't want to go larger. along with being sheer, the fabric is easily stretched, which i don't mind in this case. finally, the color. it looks white on my monitor and shows a colorful blue dot
4 The collar from a distance looks like it has seen better days (very scruffy), but it is so silky soft. and the slight sheen to the jacket is a nice twist to an ordinary army type. the fabric is definitely thinner than i expected, but it&#39;s also softer and better for layering.
4 It is a perfect weight and length. it's a great dress. i did need to have the waist altered bc it is a straight fit.
4 I really like the soft, flowy satin fabric and vibrant color of this dress! i am 5'5'' 125lbs, the s was too large, so i ordered the xs instead. things to note: pockets, elastic waistband with nice detailing on the sides, slip underneath, and large flutter sleeves. i think that women with smaller torsos should consider petite sizing.
4 Ordered this in white. it is really nice and sexy but very body hugging and unforgiving. perhaps it is my large stomach, but it hugs a bit too much for my liking. yet i think overall the design is very nice so i am keeping it and hoping i can lose some weight in my tum.
4 The sweater is comfortable and has a little 70s fabric flair...not quite as classically modern as it looks on the model. i am keeping it because it is a true fall/spring item. not a fabric weight for summer wear in california. the peach color is pretty muted, so it is not a show-stopping going-out piece.
4 I had really high hopes for this dress based on the reviews. i'm on the curvier side, but was surprised to find that my usual size 12 was very loose and long - the hem hit just below my knee. instead of feeling sexy, the weird fit just made me feel matronly. i'm going to exchange for a 10 petite, which will hopefully be a little more figure-hugging and not as long. despite my fit issues, the design is stunning, intricate, and unusual. i'm hoping that the new size will do it more justice.
4 So much prettier in person than online. the animal print isn't in your face, but subtle enough for almost any occasion. the button-up collar and slightly past knee length make it work for a casual work environment. the pleats and airiness of the dress remind me of kate middleton in anita dongre. fit: 5'4", 140 pounds - i bought a six, but the four would probably work as well. because of the lightness of the fabric, the extra fabric doesn't overwhelm my small frame. goes slightly past my knee
4 I bought this tee for the cute print. otherwise, this tee is nothing special. i usually wear an xs, but bought an xxs, based on how loose the tee looks on the model. it's pretty thin and more like a slub cotton. i think i will hand wash it, just in case.
1 I've been shopping at retailer since 2007, and floreat used to be my favorite designer, but for the past year or more, floreat mostly misses the mark. this blouse looks nothing like it does on the model. 1. it is long on her, not so in real life. this is probably the worst part about this blouse. if it were not for this, i might try on a size m and give it another chance.2. it runs very large. i usually take a l or xl. i think i would need a m in this, as mentioned above.3. in the picture, t
4 I really wanted this. they had two size small in my local retailer, both were damaged. so disappointing. i don't want to pay shipping for one that hopefully isn't damaged:( in the last year i've had multiple quality control issues with retailer. makes me gun shy. not sure i'm getting what i pay for anymore.
1 I agree with the other reviewer who said there was too much hardware and such. this really does have a lot going on. i usually wear a 4 in skirts, and based on reviews, went up one size. it still saw way up near my chest - i think even an 8 would be too small! it's sooooo tiny at the waist. probably buy 2 sizes, 2 and 3 sizes up from your own. also, the skirt flares super wide at the sides, it doesn't sit the way in the photo or maybe the model is holding it down with her hand. it's like a skirt
4 This dress is just as it looks in the pictures. shapeless. the trick is to add some styling to it. add the pilcro dark denim jacket and the headwaters scarf, and your all set. i had on black seychelle loafers but would pair it with a black d'orsay flat. the top blue of the dress is a faded sun washed looking navy and it goes well with the black of the skirt. i usually wear a 4 in dresses and the xs in this dress fit well. i'm 5'3ish", 118#, 34d-dd. this is going to be a nice winter to spring dre
4 I don't love this dress but i really like it a lot, hence the four stars. i opted for the light blue. the embroidery is a rich, vibrant blue and quite beautifully done. i am 5' 6" and 125 lbs. and the xs fits perfectly. it's intended to be a looser cut but it isn't at all frumpy and it hangs nicely. and it has pockets! all around a good summer staple.
4 This skirt is a great staple. i somewhat agree with the first reviewer that it is a little big but not huge. i bought a m which is my regular size and i have to have it shorten the length, but that is typical for me since i am very short, but i liked the waist and didn't feel like it was too big and i have a very small waist. i don't like tight elastic at the waist and this sat very comfortably on me. nice heavy material for the winter.
4 This sweater is super cute and i so wish it worked for me. i am but i must like sweaters a little longer than everyone else because this just hit me at the wrong place. if you're still trying to work off that last little bit of your baby bump, even 2 years removed, this hits right there and emphasizes your waist, at least on me and i'm 5'5". it's so cute that i might have kept it to see if i could get it to work for me but it still has the ink tag on it so it has to be returned no matter what an
4 Love this dress.  i like that it is somewhat form fitting but also has a nice swing to it.  green color is nice for summer.bought a similar maeve dress last year and it was all cotton like and soft, this one has a soft top but a different material on the bottom.  a little scratchy and crinkly.  wish the entire thing was as soft as the top
4 This is an adorable dress that just didn't work for me! so sad! i wanted to love it because the pattern is super cute. i gave it 4 stars because it is very pretty and i can see it working on others!
4 This cardigan is oh, so pretty! it does have a cropped length; it fall exactly at my waist.
4 Since the reviews are quite polarized for this dress, i thought i'd throw in my $0.02...first, to clarify, there is indeed a zipper. it's well-hidden under the l arm (i didn't think there was one based on the reviews and got it on zipped fine; once it was on, i could feel the zipper [not uncomfortably, i just realized there was one]). dress does not have a lot of give, so i imagine that zipped, it would be difficult to get off. because no give, don't order down; that said, i found this dress to
4 I just received this coat and love it. the only downside is that online the color looks like a royal blue (which i wanted) but in truth the coat is a basic navy. this was not a deal breaker for me. i love the details. it is not lined as someone mentioned earlier but it's not meant to be a heavy winter coat. i can't wait to wear it with jeans, boots and a striped or plaid tunic.
4 Beautiful sweater but the material is a bit thinner than i was expecting. but it hangs nicely and the sleeves are nice and long!
4 This dress just feels and looks amazing. i love how it isn't too short like a lot of new styles. i think it will be wonderful with leggings or tights in the winter. i also love the plaid cuff detail. the only drawback is the buttons need to be reinforced. i got home and realized one button was missing. i went to the store to swap for a new one and when i went to cuff the arms, 2 buttons popped off!
4 I love this shirt because it's casual yet fun! the first time i wore it i received several compliments because of the fun tassels.
4 I so wanted to keep this, but the xs was even too big. i usually take an xs/s petite and thought i could get away with the xs of this. it is just too big. so sad to be returning it, wish it came in an xxs or petite.
4 I purchased the orange tiger print and absolutely love it! the colors and pattern are rich and vibrant and can easily be dressed up to be worn for work or a night out!
4 I took everyone's advice and purchased a size small instead if medium.  i wish i had gotten my usual size as the neckline and bodice is very tight.  i'm top heavy with a wide rib cage and 36dd's.   other than that, the skirt of this mango hued beauty is large loose and flowing which i can see why people suggest sizing down.  i think my fit problem would be solved if petite was available.
4 I found this dress on a pretty good sale. i'd never pay full price. that said, it's very stylish. it reminds me of marni, mui mui or prada. as other posters have mentioned, it does run tight across the bust
4 This top is a mix of materials - a silk and more of a t shirt material. i purchased for dressier wear but the material makes it more casual. i like the sale price so i'm keeping!  size down, runs a tad loose.
4 This dress is so unique, and is high quality. it came nicely packaged, and unfolded with no wrinkles. i bought it as a cool summer dress for events, and it fits the bill. i wore it once, and received many compliments. the only issue, is that you cannot take even medium size steps wearing this dress. a side slit would have solved the problem, but that would not have deterred me from buying it. the straps for the slip underneath are great, so that i could adjust it so my bra would not show.
4 The fabric is a nice weight jersey. i prefer to wear the dress backwards as the back of the dress has a moderate v and the round neck (which is actually the front of the dress) makes for a very flattering back. the skirt part of the dress is full but the jersey fabric falls in such a way that does not cause the silhouette to look "hippy". this is not a dress that fits close to the body through the torso, so if you're looking for that you might consider going down a size.
4 What originally attracted me to this top was the rich floral print with the stunning and vibrant colors. however, the colors in this blouse are more vintage autumn than actually pictured on this model. although, the colors are darker, you can still wear many things with this blouse. the top is floaty but doesn't look like a tent! i feel ultra feminine and comfortable in it. definitely a top that you need for that "something special" but it is not too dressy or not too casual...just perfect! don'
4 An retailer associate gave me this to try on since i love white clothing and lace. i tried on a large for my 5'9", 36c. hourglass frame and found it to be a tad large and probably could go down a size. my thoughts are...._______________pros:- breathable and comfortable fabric due to cotton/linen blend.- lace detailing at the top is lovely.- runs tts except i found the arms ran a tad small (and i have smaller circumference). but there's enough stretch._______________cons:- extremely sheer!
1 The material is cheap and looks torn. not as nice as the picture.
4 This is a fantastic skirt and very flattering. i plan to wear this with boots as shown on the model as well as sandals when it gets warmer. i would say that it does run true to size.
4 I'm being eyeballing this dress for quite a while, finally i decided to jump on it and i was so ansy to receive it in the mail, finally arrived and some how wasn't what i was expecting, the front part has 2 pieces of fabric attached to the sides of the dress that wrap around your waist making that effect you see on the model. to be honest i didn't like that at all, i think they ruined the dress with that, the dress is very comfortable feeling, the fabric is super soft i can imagine wearing this
4 Love the perfectly placed ruching. the red lace over black and elegant. fits like a glove. gives me great curves
1 There were no reviews, it's an "online exclusive" and thought it might look good with a nice skirt at an upcoming wedding. the spandex jersey back looks like sweat shirt material. on the white version of this, it is mismatched with an oatmeal color and white that just looks awful. as a busty 36d i was stunned to find myself swimming in a medium. it does not look like the photograph and the sleeve billow out. i feel like this had to have been clipped and tucked in for this photograph. i'm an anth
4 I got the green motif color which is really multi color: blue, orange, purple, yellow, green and brown. the fabric is gauzy and sheer, nice and breezy for summer. there is a subtle stitching detail at the shoulders. i ordered my usual size, medium, and it fits well in the shoulders and arm holes, but it is extremely billowy in the body. i had to take it in a couple inches on each side to make it a little less full. it's still has some swing, but not quite as much as before.
4 I saw this dress in the catalog and on-line and it looked so lovely on the models. i took a chance and ordered it in my normal size small. when it arrived i was a little disappointed with the weight of the fabric, it was a bit light in my opinion. it did have an interesting texture, (suede like) so i could overlook the weight of the fabric if the dress fit well. unfortunately it did not, it rather just hung there and was not flattering on me. it looked wonderful on the model but i keep forgettin
1 I've purchased pilcro jeans in the past and they've held up great. unfortunately, the material used for this particular jean is a far, far cry from what it used to be. the thighs of these jeans start pilling (yes pilling!) after just a few wears. i've never had jeans do this -- whatever denim blend they are using is a complete disaster.don't buy these -- you will be very disappointed.
4 This was a really nice, soft lightweight sweater, perfect for transitioning into fall. i found it to be a tad boxy and while i love a high/lo hem, it was a little short in the front for my liking. i'm still debating if i'm keeping it since i bought it full price, but the color was really pretty and on sale, i would def. go for it. for reference, i got a large since i normally like my clothes more loose.
4 Although $$$$$ i want to support usa products and am so glad retailer continues to add these options .i also decided to splurge with family coming home for the holidays, a way to stay in pajamas but still look dressed. i am only 5'2" and these were just longer than capri length, more like the close-up view online. to get them ankle length you would have to push them way down on your hips, not sure how the tall model did that! i am 106 lbs and considered exchanging the xs for an s, these run
4 Really like the style/aesthetics of the top. it is very unique, and works with a variety of pants. the only downsides are that it flares out a bit more than it appears on the model, and it arrived somewhat wrinkled. i am 5' 6" 125 pounds and i got a size 4. looking forward to wearing this a lot in the fall.
4 Very comfy and easily could dress down or up!
4 Tried this romper on in store and wanted to love it but it just didn't fit me right. it'a great romper, cute design, super soft-light fabric and overall a great feel but it doesn't work to well for short girls with any types of hips. i have a very small waist and larger bottom and this romper just was very unflattering. i couldn't get the tie waist to sit anywhere that felt like my natural waist, instead it kept giving me a kangaroo pouch and hung on my upper thighs. sizing up didn't help becaus
4 It does snag easily which stinks because it's darling and i love it to pieces.... i just hope it doesn't end up in pieces!
4 Love the knit. contrast stitches add interest. quality is great and it is true to size. very happy i made this purchase, especially because i caught it on sale after eyeing it for months. great with denim or a black dress.
1 I stalked this sold out product for weeks hoping my size would become available. when it did, i was very excited, in fact i ordered both a s and xs to be sure one sweater would fit me! unfortunately, neither did and i felt the actual sweater was not as pictured. the sweater has an overall baggy fit and the cutouts don't fall as neatly and as evenly on both shoulders as the picture shows, making the look a bit sloppy in my opinion. it is such a shame as this look is very of the moment and the mod
4 This is a great sweater. i gave it four instead of five stars because it runs unusually wide and is a bit boxy. if you like your clothes a little big, this is the sweater for you!
4 Beautiful spring dress. perfect for luncheons or any occasion. so very pretty, lovely fabric and good fit. you will definitely feel pretty in this dress. y daughter is 5'3" and the length was perfect.
4 I usually wear a 6 for skirts and dresses, but when i got this in the mail, it ended up fitting a bit snug on my hips. other than that its super cute and has a great liner underneath!
4 I bought this in both the navy (a more saturated blue in person - gorgeous!) and green, but both are going back. it fit everywhere but in the upper arms, even across my chest, and i usually encounter the opposite. i think it might just be the way it's cut across the shoulders that don't allow for much movement. so, while beautiful and so incredibly soft, it has to go back. (if you have slender arms, i think it would be a great fit.)
4 This dress is sweatshirt material and a lovely soft grey aqua color. i purchased a medium and it is an inch above my knee...ii am so tired of seeing woman my age and much younger in jeans...i am wearing this to a cooking class and it is perfect because it is so comfortable.....it is a great replacement for jeans!!!!!!!
1 #childsize. not sure where this went wrong but it's going back immediately. always wear a 0-2 in retailerpologist skirts, this size 0 runs at least two sizes too small. the material is beautiful, but if i got the size i needed i would be entirely swallowed by fabric. so disappointing.
4 I love the print and design, the photo does not do it justice. i fell in love with it in the store but could not find my size. i ordered my size online but it was still small and short. it came up to my waist, and was tight in the shoulders and waist. i really wish it wasn't so small. i love love this top, the colors are vibrant and shiny, totally my style. i highly recommend it if it fits.
4 Beautiful color and  soft material but runs a little big so size down. i loved that it was complementing to my figure without making me look larger
4 True to size i found. got the medium and had a bit of room to spare. usually i'm a 6 on the lower half, (34-28-36).the upper portion is a very very light heathered grey, almost cream and yes, i found it to be see through.comfortable but either for lounging round the house only or wear a tunic to cya!
4 I ordered this blouse after it went on sale - i'm not typically the blouse-y type, but i thought i'd try it. for me, and i'm a pretty consistent small across brands, it was quite flowing and a little long, but that may be what someone wants. it was a little light in color to look good on me, but i think this would be really cute with dark skinny jeans - easy to dress up or down :)
1 These jeans were so cute on- wore them a handful of times and they'd been washed twice. put them on and - rip! ripped right at the crotch in the front so not fixable- and on vacation no less when i had to scramble to find something else to wear. poor quality - disappointing and not what i expected from retailer. :-( they also run large even for a more relaxed fit- sized down for a good fit.
4 These shorts were exactly as expected. they are nice thin shorts perfect for a hot summer in texas. i have just worn a few times out running errands in high 90 degree weather and they were perfect. i bought the grey and they are a nice change from jean shorts, but still match just about any top. i typically wear a size 0, but after reading the reviews purchased a size 2, so i would say they run a little small. they are slightly snug in the waist, but i ordered online and liked them enough to kee
4 I saw this tee and was unsure about the print, but decided to give it a try. i'm glad i did, as it has become a weekend staple.
4 Beautiful suit. i had been eyeing this one for weeks and finally decided to just buy the darn thing. it is tiny, just beware. as in it doesn't cover much, especially on the booty. not a bad thing, but buyer beware :) if you are looking for more coverage, size up. i wear a 32d and ordered a medium top. good thing i didn't get a small. i have to get the band taken in a bit, but i need the coverage in the cup. for the bottoms i also got a medium and usually wear a small or medium in swimwear bo
4 This great casual jacket has a confusing fit but if you know what you want and understand the style, you can be surely happy with this plush & smooth stadium coat. first, the neutral/beige fits a little easier but it is definitely larger in the body compared to the navy. for both colors the shoulders and sleeves are fitted (perhaps a little tight) while the body has an a-line flare and subtle hi-lo hem. the neutral really flares out a lot while the blue is a gentle flare. if you have narrow shou
4 I ordered this top in the pink in a medium (i usually wear a small or medium in retailer shirts). it fit tts with not being too short. the embrodiery is very pretty, better in person than online. my only complaint is it's a bit blousey, so you would need to either tuck it in or wear with skinny jeans/shorts. for reference, i am 5" 4.5"' 135 lbs and a 32c.
4 While it hasn't been cold enough to wear this out, i really like this sweater. i love the pattern with the uneven hem and stripes or bands. it's also super soft and cozy feeling. it does run a little big, and while that is part of the aesthetic, i do wish it was a drop smaller. i ordered my normal top size, medium, and it's a little big/looser, which i don't mind except for the long sleeves. if you like things with a tighter fit i might order a size down.though it's cashmere, it still seems
4 I saw the cream color in size regular small in the "only one left" section at my local store. i had my heart set on this dress all summer but it was sold out, so i was super excited to see it. the color is true cream, like linen color. i was surprised that the dress is very heavy, as heavy as a medium sized coat. i can't understand why it's so heavy because the top is sleeveless and the dress part is pretty sheer. the dress is about 2" pass my feet which i wouldn't mind having it hemmed, but the
4 I love this dress it is a little sheer so nothing that spanx won't cover. i have worn it a couple of times and have gotten many compliments.
4 Very soft for vegan leather. very stylish. i thought it ran slightly small for size indicated on jacket. daughter is 8-10 but medium was tight.
4 I grabbed this during a 20% off sale so i will state first that i don't think this top is worth full price, and even at 20% off i wasn't wowed enough to pay that much for it. the colors are more saturated in person and very pretty. however, the cut- both the length and the width- just made it too overwhelming on my size 14/16 frame. i ordered the xl and it was wayyyy too big through the chest but sizing down to a large meant that it didn't flow over my hips as well because it's so long. i think
4 Very pretty blouse. it does run quite large, i am usually an xs-s or 0-4 and purchased the 0. i could probably have gone to a 00. for reference i am 5'4" 118 lbs 34b/c. it says that it is dry clean only, however i washed in in delicate cycle with cold water and threw in the dryer for a little bit. it came out perfect! i was hoping to shrink it and it only shrunk a tiny bit. i was hoping for it to shrink more but it is fine. no need to even iron it! i was lucky enough to get it on sale, i don't t
4 First off, i adore this jumpsuit.  i love the mixed stripes and i love that the fabric is structured, textured and substantial.  and for me, the xs fits perfectly, however the sizing is way off from standard sizing. i'm 5'2", 110, 24.5 waist, 32.5 hips, and usually 00p-0p, and this is fitted on me.  the wide legs aren't too wide like most wide legs (which wear me instead of vice versa) and the structure of the fabric make this piece so flattering for petite ladies.  if you are petite, this jumps
1 Unfortunately this top is shirt-length, and i'm only 5'4". needs to be about 6" longer. made of sweatshirt material, which i wouldn't mind if it were longer. also runs very wide- ordered an xs and could have gone smaller.
4 Perfect length and colors. i get asked where i got it on the reg, every time i wear it. mostly a casual vibe with flat sandals...
4 Love this dress. very comfortable and stylish. wanted my size. but they only had a size larger available. still bought it, but feel good in it. glad i purchased it.
1 I wanted to love this blouse so much. but try as i might, it just fit so oddly on me. i'm usually a petite s so i purchased the xs in brown. first. the color was more gray-brown but it was still ok. but second, the fit was off. maybe i just got a bad one, but the center of the blouse was so offset, that the slit in the front laid so far to the left and the v-neck was so low that you could see my bra - there was no adjusting i could do to fix it. the material has a lovely soft silky feel to it an
1 I really wanted to love this top, but there is way too much fabric. it looks nothing like the pictures. it was more like a maternity top vs. a swingy top. i'll be returning this one.
4 Tried both colors....gorgeous, but kept the white as it offers more versatility in my wardrobe. happened to have an retailer cami that follows the lines of this top exactly to help conceal how transparent it is. [the black color will also need a cami -- strong sunlight or a camera flash will be revealing.] a lovely layering piece under sweaters, vests, jackets. so pleased!
4 Purchased today at the 30% off summer tag sale. 5'7 and bought the size 6 - fits perfectly. a lovely combination of feminine and boho. will wear with dark jeans a a white tank. fabulous light, pretty summer topper...
4 The moss color intrigued me so i ordered a medium instead of large because it looked oversized. i generally wear a large. medium is a good fit. probably could have ordered the small, but wanted to preserve the draping on the side. this top is very wide but it looks great on. so do size down. love the color variations. it's true to the pics and is a nice addition to my casual lifestyle.
4 I ordered my usual size small in this top (34c) and it just fits across the chest. very cute top.
4 This vest is very warm and soft. it is actually a fleece that almost appears as wool. the plaid is beautiful-a pretty soft pink with the black and charcoal colors. i ordered a size large and the fit is okay. an xl would have been too big under the arms and in the bust area however, i would have liked it a little looser in the bottom half. i kept the large as there is no closure to the vest. it just hangs open.
4 This dress is really good quality and the beading is adorable. but, the sleeves combined with the maxi skirt made me look like i was a sister wife and not in a $250 dress. i still gave it four stars though, because i am having it hemmed to above the knee because i like the top part so much. i ordered the 00p, am 5'1 110 lbs and the waist fit perfect, the skirt was about three inches above my ankles. perhaps someone with a more boho style might find the length of the skirt cute but i just found i
1 Like the previous review said, i was excited to receive this top. i had grand visions of all the ways i could wear it! to my chagrin, when i put it on, it just fell right down and pooled around my waist. i wish there were smaller sizes to order. sadly, this is going back.
4 The fabric on this dress is gorgeous. i wish it was tailored a bit more because as it is, it looks like a muumuu. i wish it would have fit better, but i returned it.
4 I tried this on as it was on sale and my size was on the store. i didn't end up buying it as it felt jsut meh compared to so many cute cardigans. i do have a couple of grey ones and tried on grey, so perhaps i jsut dind't need it... pros: short so would work with dresses and high waist.
4 These pants have a really cute design. however, they are a bit short (and i'm only 5'4"). i'm still happy i purchased them, but i thought i was purchasing full length pants (as shown on the model) and not capris.
4 Beautiful white top. peplum never looged good on me until i found this one. i am 5.4, 34 dd and this peplum looked good on me. most white tops are see through int he front and this one isn't. but back is a little see through. for casual that much see though is good. not sure for office. but this is still a keeper for me :)
4 This dress is not form fitting and some might consider it a little "shapeless". however, the color is stunning, the quality is great, and its a great dress for a wedding where you want to stand out but not have to worry about anything too constricting. great for dancing the night away - the under layer and frill at the bottom are perfect. i am very pleased with this purchase!
4 This dress is one of my new favorites. i usually wear a medium petite but had to size down in order to get it to fit properly. i was able to get the green one, while visiting in san francisco. i wish more stores had a petite section! it was great to be able to try things on!!!
4 The skirt is not as form fitting as i had hoped. it is a lot of material that is flowy and billowy, not straight and pencil-like as shown as in the pictures. the material and design is just okay- not super wowed by it. i did size down but feel like i might need to size down even more to get more of a fitted look.
4 This is a lovely dress. it is on the heavy side and lined, so i would not recommend for hot summer wear. but the material and style are adorable. the skirt is definitely a-line, not sheath, but i prefer that. it runs a tad too tight in the chest, so if you're between sizes in the bust, i'd order up. that said, a 6 would be too big for me. i'm 5'4, 120 lbs and 34c and usually wear a 4.
4 This definitely works for you - think fabric, great quality, and i'm 25 weeks and i think i'll be able to use this to the end. got my normal-ish size. would never have kept this if i wasn't pregnant, cause you can definitely accommodate a pregnancy (or maybe go down two sizes if not). this is not my first baby either! love for my pregnancy.
4 I was walking by my local retailer and saw this in the window and loved the colors. it's a great combination and looks good with white jeans, and regular denim. i like the cuffs on the sleeves and the textured material. it is a kimono - so in essence it is not form fitting. it's meant to flow over whatever else you have on. i purchased the xs/s and i am a normal size 2 and it looks cute. i got lots of compliments when i wore it! there are slits on either side at the bottom hem as well which allow
4 The fabric and detailing of this dress is of superior quality, but unfortunately it runs huge-- you definitely need to wear a tank or cami underneath. i am 5'9 145lbs with massive shoulders/smaller bust and i got the xs petite!
4 This is a great top and it fit me very nicely but it's much longer than it appear to be in the picture. i'm 5'2 and it was more like a tunic than a tank on me. if it were shorter it would be one of my favorite staples i'm sure. if you're very tall i think you will love it.
1 This is not a kimono. it's a cocoon. there's a huge difference.it's also not made very well.
4 I love the neckline on this - sharp enough for work, but cute for a fun night out too. only complaint is it's soooo flowy on the bottom. i could hide a baby under here for sure. i got the medium thank goodness or it would have been ridiculous. i'm 5'8, 160lbs. great for fall.
4 I was expecting these to be the normal thickness of everyday leggings, plus fleece. instead, they're more like thicker-than-average tights. still warm, though there's a weird seam on the inside of the thighs that takes away from some of the comfort. not so bad that i want to return them, but not what i was hoping for, either.
4 I'm very glad i snatched this up when i did. it is super soft and the perfect length. i love the slight peplum as it makes for a very flattering fit. i can tell this shirt will be a staple year round as it works great with shorts or jeans. for me, i think the large was a tiny bit big in the waist, but it might shrink in the wash. the armholes were nice too, and didn't gap.
4 Feels a bit more tunic than blouse but it's a lovely piece all the same.
1 From the photos, i thought the design was embroidered. in reality, it is stamped on. there is a tiny bit of embroidery and a few sequins, but overall, the design is just printed on the fabric. i didn't feel it looked good, in fact it looked kind of cheap to me, so i returned it. the overall style of the jacket was great and it would have looked equally good for work or casual. i was disappointed it didn't work out.
4 Lovely, flowing dress w a boho vibe. pretty design and fabric. agree w comments re stiff slip fabric but will keep it anyway. should be a great summer dress
1 Didn't like the dress. look pregnant in it. this dress is going back.
4 I loved this dress when it came out this summer but it quickly became impossible to get. i snagged up this one as quickly as i could when it came out. i don't really love any of the fall colors it was offered in, but for this one - i would say it is much more rust and less orange in person.
4 This sweater is far more slouchy and relaxed in fit than in it seems in the photograph. definitely size down. honestly, i kinda love it anyways! the inside is so very soft, and it's perfect for a sleek errand-running or hiking kind of day!
4 This is my go to, cool, summer dress. it's very light and airy and extremely comfortable. great for 90 degree days!highly recommend!
4 I've worn this dress to work with a black corset belt and to disneyland as is. it's made of a medium weight knit that doesn't cling. the cut is flattering. i wish they had an option with no slits. though this alternate cut would be significantly less comfortable, it would create a sexier silhouette. i purchased this item on sale.i'm a little worried that it'll shrink in the wash. i've had varied luck with fabric containing modal.
4 These pants are great, super cute and comfy. the price is too high but i do love them.
1 I thought from the picture this would be a light floaty top. when it arrived, the fabric was a heavy knit and the neckline sagged very low. on me (granted i'm a pear) the bottom layer hugged my tummy and rear in a very unflattering way. the only thing i liked was the color. back it went.
4 This is a really pretty top. the beading/rivet detail is really cool and it feels comfortable on. i think the lining is really silky and the lace feels gentle, not stiff. the top is kind of like a swing top, there is a lot of fabric, but it is just right. the fabric looks rich and lovely. great top!
4 It's a pretty dress, my only concern is the sleeve length. it's an awkward length and makes the dress look a little frumpy. i turned the sleeve up once and it looks so much better!. or, if you are a savvy sewer, you may want to tighten a little in the arms so the sleeve is a bit more fitted. overall quality and feel is very good. i usually fit into a 6, but for this dress i ordered both 6 and 8 and kept the 8. the chest is a bit snug and the button pops open if you don't order the correct size.
4 I love the fit of the stevie jean. they are not too tight to make them inappropriate for a mom/teacher, but are definitely not your momma's jeans either. i have two pair (gray and a dark denim) and both fit perfectly after a wash. however, the waist stretches out throughout the day enough that i have to wear a belt which i never do! i could probably size down, but i didn't want the thighs to be too tight. for reference i'm 5'2" 130 lbs. and wear a pretty standard 2, sometimes 4. i bought these i
4 This shirt is comfy, fits well, the color (pink or dusty rose) works well with most outfits, but the front hook is ill-placed and often visible. it could be tucked under better so as not to show, but it isn't and does show. i feel that i frequently need to fluff it up to hide the hook. otherwise, i like it, but i wouldn't have bought it unless it was on discount, which it was.
4 This dress is beautiful--lovely colors and design--but it's huuuge. i'm usually a s/m in tops and dresses, but i got an xs after trying it on in the store. i'm busty and have hips and still have a bit of room. the length is good--a little above the knee but still work appropriate. with my curves it's not my most flattering dress since it pretty much falls straight down, but i think it's too pretty not to keep.
4 This jumper is so much more flattering than it appears in the product photo! i am not sure why it was paired in a way that made it look so wintery- and did not play up on the capri length and interesting artsy top! i am a curvy 4 or a 6, smaller on top, with hips. i love this fit. it it pulls in at a high waist, with a stretch in the pants---it's just adorable! i would say that the top portion is quite fitted- it's not a stretchy material, more of a textured thick fabric- so that is somethin
4 I bought the fuschia colored tank to wear under a sweater for the fall. great color. fits well.
1 I'm 5'7", 130 lbs. i ordered a medium-regular. the dress fell three inches above my knees. this model is taller than i am, and it falls to her knees....doesn't make sense. i think retailer sends petites in place of regular.
4 A lovely, creatively designed tunic that just isn't for me.  the embroidery is certainly intricate and the chambray shirt has a wearable hand, but the combination on my body type didn't look quite right, probably because i am too top heavy and apple torsoed.  i think if i were more slender, the fit would look like a flattering dress.  i had purchased the size 10 and i am 36dd 140#.
4 I absolutely loved this dress when i first saw it. the fit was not quite what i expected. i usually sport a 0 or 2, but this dress wouldn't zip up all the way in a 2, so i return/exchanged it for a 4.
4 Cute dress but way too big. i ordered a 2 petite and i'm swimming in it. i'm usually a size 2-4 and 5'4".will exchange for smaller size since i think it would be really great if fit properly.
1 I really liked the design. ordered a medium which was huge. also thought i would not be able to tolerate it because of the material -- a bit itchy. returned it.
1 I'm a big retailer buyer- and usually love the dresses, especially the petite xs maxis. this was the worst retailer purchase i have ever made. it was humongous and gave me no shape. even if i purchased an xxsp it probably would be the same. i'm small but i mean come on- this would only fit a giantess-- which also makes no sense because it's the petite size. do not buy. i'm very upset i have to pay the $5.95 return fee since i ordered this.
4 I bought this in the plum & love the color. i got this in xs which is my usual size & it's a little bit baggy but i think this is the style of the sweater. the front on me is not as long as pictured but just covers the top of my pants. my daughter liked it so much she bought the exact same one.
4 I loved this sweater as soon as i opened the package. it was soft and the colors of grey peach and white were perfect for this to were into the spring time. i am 5'3 102lbs and purchased the xs. the arm length was perfect. the sweater length hit slightly above my hips. the style of the sweater is a bit boxy, but not so much that it looks like your wearing a tent.
4 Runs small in the chest, so don't order if you are large chested! over all, very cute.
4 I think this dress is cute! it caught my eye in the store and i got a bunch of compliments when i tried it on. i like the sunny yellow. i plan on wearing it to an outdoor wedding on the amalfi coast of italy in the spring. i am petite - 5'-2", 105lbs and purchased a size 2. i think it may run a little tight in the chest, so perhaps consider sizing up if you have average or larger breasts. i love the pockets! the fabric seems to wrinkle easily, so hopefully i won't be too rumpled after having it
4 I really like the style of this top, the open sleeves are subtle. i think it is even work appropriate in a business casual environment. it is slightly short waisted in my opinion and runs a little small, but my usual medium worked for me. i am a solid 8.
4 I tried on the xs in the store (115 lbs, 30dd chest, short). fit: i think it is a little big, i would tend to go for a xxs petite in this for me, the length was ok, but would look more flattering in petite. also, the waist was on the looser side. the green color is amazing though, very flattering and springy/summery. the flow of the dress is also very nice. the weird thing is the belt at the waist, it starts a little off from the seam, and doesn't go all the way around, not sure if i love it or
4 This dress is adorable. i found it to be true to size, but i do have a small bust so perhaps that helped with the sizing issue the other reviewer encountered. i love the embroidery throughout, it beautifully constructed and feels lush. i'm 5'9" and the dress falls to my ankles, but that's ok because it will look beautiful with heels or flats. i love the dress and cant wait to wear but gave it a 4-star rating because of the side zipper. it is extremely hard to zip up past your waist because of th
1 Sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is. i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life. this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style. another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump . i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was $5.00!!!
4 For a blouse this beautiful and whimsical, i just can't understand why the little button loops would need to be constructed to maintain security on fort knox. i patiently worked my way through the gauntlet of them because i was determined to try it on, but ultimately, i can't see doing this again for a pricey top that shouldn't require hard labor to access. the fabric is perfect; a beautiful cotton lawn without any sheen, which really brings out the contrast of colors. it is slightly see through
4 I am 5'5. 125 pounds, size 4-ish (sometimes a 4, sometimes a 6), athletic build. these pants fit great except they are pretty large around the waist, about 2 extra inches of space. i don't think the problem would be fixed by sizing down since only the waist was large. i will need to get them tailored.
4 Great summer shirt, loose and casual. it's pretty flowy and not form-fitted at all. i almost always wear a petite xs in retailer, and that is what i got (i'm 5'4 and 125 pounds). fits great- loose and swingy, but is big (i like this). retailer, please get/restock petites for the pink color!
4 As a curvy, short gal, finding a nice button down that isn't boxy or way too low cut is like finding a gem. this shirt is perfect for work, and i love how flattering it is. my only reservation is that it is more sheer than i would like, and so i need a camisole with it. i wish this style came in more colors!
4 This piece is comfortable and easy to pair with leggings or denim. soft and not too heavy.
4 I absolutely love this top, the design and the cut. it is very long in the back. it is very flattering. i would have given it 5 stars except it is see through. i wish it didn't need a cami. layering tops gets old fast in the hot weather.
4 Yes it is thin but a great summer blouse. the body runs true to size, but the sleeves are tight..i may try to size up so the sleeves can be more comfortable.
4 Comfy, but constantly picking pills off of it, from first wear.
4 I love wearing this to bed and it's really pretty! the lace is thin and delicate, so it can get snagged easily, but it's pretty comfortable. the only thing that could make it more comfortable is if the material underneath the bust was looser, though it wouldn't be as supportive. overall, i think it's a very beautiful chemise!
4 The reviews i read scared me a little about this top being super cropped. it is on the short side, but will be adorable with shorts and pants that aren't low cut. the multi-textured fabric is gorgeous!
1 The fabric wrinkles so easily and any slight moisture or liquid immediately turns into a dark spot on the blue grey...condensation drips from a glass, gel deodorant, etc. i tried the cream but it's very sheer. i had to return this dress-- not practical!
4 This dress is lovely . i am 5' 1, athletic and busty (38 d/dd) - but not super slim so not easy to petite items that fit in the chest/arms. i ordered pm which usually works and it was actually too big in the chest. im waiting on the ps but think it will work since the cut is generous. material/item is so lovely and comfortable!! i never have extra chest room, so this was such a great surprise!! hope the ps is great but think it will be unless they went crazy on making it to small.
4 This cute dress highlights some trouble spots and emphasizes good parts too, so i'm happy but not ecstatic.  for myself, the sleeves are tight and  so is the fit across the back and shoulders.  sizing up makes the voluminous skirt overwhelming.  the skirt is already a lot to handle in my regular size.  the good part is the pattern, swingy silhouette and it covers my tummy.  i have thick arms, wide bust, round back and meaty shoulders.  140# 5'3" 36d and purchased size 10.
1 I loved this skirt when i tried it on. the material is soft with a bit of stretch. i'd say this runs a little large. for reference, i'm usually a size 2/4 in retailer and the 2 was still a little large towards the end of the day as it stretched out. however, my disappointment was with the buttons.i wore it for a day when all of a sudden the top button popped off. fine, that button is the most used. i sewed it back on myself and even reinforced the top three buttons that i use to take on and of
4 Okay, this is the cutest sleep jumper i've ever owned. it's soft and cozy, and even a tiny bit sexy. i give it 4 stars because it's a little on the thin side; not sheer but close. really fun little piece. definitely recommend.
4 The great thing about a swing dress is that it doesn't cling to the curves. this one is the same way. i got the geometric print. the colors are fun. i would have gone down to the small just to loose some of the material on this dress if it had not fit across so tight across the back. if you have no bust, i would say size down two sizes or try a petite. the dress has a breathable fabric so great for summer wear. the only cons are the large armpits and extra fabric but sizing down should help.
1 The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality, and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit, immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.
4 This is well made and beautiful, but it sometimes slides off so i feel like i'm adjusting it somewhat regularly.
1 This shirt fits very closely to the body. it has a very strange fit in the shoulder, though. the arms themselves are really long, far past my hands, yet it's very tight in the shoulder and under arm area. for reference, i am 5'10", 130 pounds and ordered a small, which is what i usually need.
4 I bought this top during the extra 30% off sale, so the price was definitely worth it and i know i'll get a lot of wear out it. i bought the grey and the lace isn't too revealing, but just enough for me to want to wear a cami underneath, especially at work. i'm normally a small/4 in retailer brands, but i bought a xs and it fits great, so it does run a little large.
4 This skirt is a really beautiful print and made of a lovely silky fabric. i didn't have the "see-through" issue that the other reviewer mentioned, my main concerns were the length (i'm 5'1 and it almost goes to my ankles) and that it poofs out a little right below the waist band. i'm between a small and a medium and went with the small. it fits but i wonder if it would lie flatter and be more flattering if i had gone with a medium instead.
1 I generally don't write bad reviews, but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost. the design and colors are great, but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturer's tag is at the back of the neck. the material is very thin, so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment. i shop at retailer all the time, and this is not a $98 item of clothing.
4 Loved this tee but embroidery started to unravel even before being washed. i paid full price for this top and wasn't disappointed but needed to return due to the embroidery problem. this tee is a mustard color.
4 I so wanted to buy this top - especially during the 30% off tops sale this past weekend - so it would have been just about $100.  but while it was well made, i could see it easily snagging or getting caught on jewelry.    if it was on sale even more, i might have considered it.  it could be extremely versatile, with jeans, black skinny pants or leggings.  really loved it, but couldn't see spending that much money on it.
4 I love wearing a dress at thanksgiving but don't want to be too dressy. this was perfect;: casual with a bit of sass and comfortable. it's also arm enough and super cute with booties. i'm 5'4" and small boned. the xs fit perfect.
4 I like that the top is lightweight and very comfortable and is flattering. i can see wearing this over the holidays for entertaining. it looks festive and pretty - something easy to pop on and look pulled together in a flash.
4 I ordered one size down and it's still plenty roomy. as others have said, the sleeves are a tighter fit, but there is a tiny bit of stretch to the fabric. i'm smaller busted and didn't want the v-neck to get too low, so i sized down one. very cute tucked into jeans or paired with leggings.
4 This sweater is really lovely. it doesn't look like it does in the picture. i got the xsmall as i was worried it would run big. it's much shorter than i though, fits more like a petite size. the sleeves are 3/4 length, which i wasn't thrill with but accepted. the color combo is really lovely! it's very comfortable and well made and it was perfect for work but lovely with a pair of jeans too!
4 But i stil ldecided to pass. i would need the petite as it seemd long. also, there are other items i loved more, but if you need a cozy sweater that is different, this might be the one for you. the contrasting detaisl on the sleeves/collar are very nice.
4 The attention to detail in aligning the pattern is excellent as always with this brand..i tried a size 2 and it fit fine, just above my long waist ( 5'2", currently 33-25-37.5 with narrow hips and fuller thighs). i have several other cartonnier shorts in sizes 0 and 2, depending on my weight, and these fit similarly. i think the size 2 petite would be a bit lower but it's sold out now..the only reason i passed was that the fabric has a polyester fusible interfacing so that it keeps its s
4 I wanted a nice, well-fitting top that would work with trousers, jeans, and skirts alike, and be a nice wardrobe staple. i got two of these tops - one size s (black) and one m (turquoise). the size m is gigantic and i have to return it. the size s is also a whole lotta shirt. the top is really long and has a multi-level bottom, as well as the pocket, making it not just a simple top but a rather "loud" top. nevertheless, i'm keeping the size s (black) as a versatile shirt that i can hopefully tuc
4 This top fits a bit trimmer than the summer version of this top did. the lavender color is muted and a nice fall transition color.
1 This was a disappointment because beautiful fabrics with interesting design are a rarity--and especially at this length! unfortunately, this is a mess in terms of proportions. if a size 2 can barely get it off, then there is a design flaw. sadly, the fit was so strange that it did not seem that simply sizing up would correct the flaws.
1 Extremely cute sweater, but after having worn it twice it's already pilling up. i'd expect more for a $100 sweater.
4 I honestly liked this little cardigan. it is a misnomer as a jacket. it really is more of a light sweater/cardigan, but i didn't have any negative issues like others on here.________pros:- great feel on the skin and fabric. this really caught my attention. hard to find a sweater that's breathable for cool summer evenings or mornings.- color scheme will go with anything, elegant touch.- unlined making it breathable.- runs large, forgiving it. stretchy. i'm normally a size 10/12 (m/l)
4 This dress is so light and twirly and the fabric is as airy as it is pretty. sadly the fit was a bit off. i am 5'7", 128. i tried on my usual sz 2 and found the top to be saggy at the armpits but too tight at the waist seam; going up to a 4 only made for a saggier top. most likely a great dress for lean or long-torsoed ladies, which sadly i'm not!
4 The stitched pattern on this shirt is so pretty! it fits loosely and looks good with a slimmer bottom. it is a little bit itchy but i didn't feel i needed to wear something underneath.
4 I followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down from a s to xs. i was worried about the length of the torso since i'm long in that area, but the xs still worked great. it's a totally adorable jumpsuit with a nice fit. my biggest peeve with this was that it came dirty on the hems...like it had been dragged on the ground somewhere. unfortunately, there were no more xs online once i got it though, so i will keep and try to clean. this is not the first time in recent months that i have recei
4 This sweater is really cute, and comfortable - but the color is a tad off from the picture. it's a deeper blue than i was expecting, and the pocket is not a "rust" color as depicted online. it's definitely closer to red. other than that, i still do like it - the speckles are a nice touch, and it is true to size, and not too short.
4 Love the cute print and texture of fabric. perfect casual t-shirt.
4 This is a darling white top. the juxtaposition of the simple front and the beautiful lace back makes this a unique piece. definitely size down.
4 This dress is adorable, but fit a bit large through the waist. i ordered the 6 and am exchanging for the 4, so hopefully it will work better for me. for reference, i am 5'7, 135 lbs curvy. the fabric is soft and swingy and the striped under-layer is feminine and adorable. love.
4 Cute shirt, nice for layering.
1 I ordered this skirt in a size small and when i received it, not only was it too long, but there was also a hole in it. so i returned it. when a small petite became available, i ordered it thinking it would fit better. i just received it and there is a hole in this skirt as well. both skirts also looked as if they had been worn; there was fuzz and lint all over the skirts. i like the skirt but i either have extremely bad luck or it's really bad quality.
4 I ordered this shirt, aware of what the other reviewers said about it being tight in the chest. it's true- it's a bit restrictive if you need full-range of motion for your shoulder blades, but if you're not planning on doing any heavy-lifting or sporting events in this top, it's just fine (disclaimer- i am small-chested). i will stick by my tts, though, because it was the right fit, despite being restrictive. i was worried the top was going to be a 'hard' jean, but it wasn't. it was nice and sof
1 If you have any curves, avoid! it is not flattering.the striped side panels look odd with the flow of the dress.
4 I really like these. they're not too distressed, and the frayed ankle looks great. not too casual that you couldn't wear them to the office. the length is perfect on me, (i'm 5'1) i can wear them with sandals and booties without having to roll them up. they do run about one size small. i'm 5'1, 120 lbs, a slightly curvey petite and the 27 fit best,.
4 It's a lovely and unexpected sweater. a few things to keep in mind- - the knit details are beautiful- the pictures don't do it justice.- it's pretty lightweight.- the color is a little darker than the picture shown- it's a very dark plum- it runs bigger- this is the only retailer sweater where the sleeves of a m are a little to long. - the style is decidedly casual and "slouchy". it looks great with jeans, but don't plan to dress up an outfit with this piece.
4 I love cute summer dresses and this one, especially because it is made out of linen, is unique. it is very well-made with a design that is quite flattering. i am 5 foot 6 and a little curvy with a 38 c bust and i got a size 10. it fits well although it is difficult to zip up because the material has no give. the perfect dress to wear to italy or france! now i just have to book my tickets!
4 So this skirt is everything. the only downside is that it's not in a petite sizing so i'm going to have to get this altered (i'm 5'3). the sizing is appropriate (usually wear an 8 or 10 in pants and got a size medium for the skirt), the material is thick enough for spring or summer weather, the color is just right (not too light), the pockets are adorable and i feel like i'm channeling some 70's realness, sits higher on your waist, and is super comfortable. i know i'm going to get a lot of use o
4 I bought this dress for a wedding but decided it wasn't dressy enough and ended up exchanging it even though i really wanted to keep it? i ordered a xs and it fit like a glove, the gathering makes for a forgiving and flattering look and the color is absolutely gorgeous! very classy length for such a form fitting dress, too. i probably would have cut down the neck if i ended up keeping it bc high/tight turtlenecks aren't my thing which is reason for only 4 stars.
4 The retailer by me actually had this and i had to try it on. my thoughts below:___________pros:- well-constructed with lining underneath to avoid the need of a cami or tank. no see-through issues whatsoever.- the fabric is great quality and looks nicely sewn. no fraying or strays seen on the 2 sizes i tried.- there's a back zipper that goes from top to bottom at the back. unusual as i don't see why that's needed since you can just slip it over your head.- front "v slit" isn't too low or reve
4 I really like this top. it's super cute - perfect for a football game or fairly casual event. the material is ribbed and is thick enough that you can't see through. i purchased this top in red and initially in petite but ended up returning it for the regular size. i love this top!
4 Really beautiful dress, too special for me as a guest at a wedding. i think this can be used as a wedding dress in an informal intimate wedding. it is shift dress, so not accentuate your body which is to be expected. it is running small. with my athletic body especially up top, the chest/arms are tight. i could have gone a size up but the body might be too big. i unto lately returned.
4 This is a really beautiful top. the colors are lovely a subtle. it is larger than i expected. i ordered a small which is my usual size and it is more of a baggy tunic. it still works because the material is so sheer, but does not fit me like the photo size down
4 I tried on this top in the ivory color in the store, but i didn't need another ivory-colored top, so i passed it up. however, i kept thinking about the pretty details, especially trim on the sleeves, so when i saw it online in the red color, i ordered it. i was surprised when it arrived with how thin and sheer the fabric is (the soft flowy mini-pleated body of the shirt; the other sections are flat cotton, which is more sturdy). i hadn't noticed this when i tried on the ivory version! but i'm ke
1 I purchased this jacket in my local store. size 10 and runs really small . i love the color combination and design but the fabric in my opinion is poor quality. i have seen a lot of retailer use this poly spun knit in so much of their items and the jacket after bringing it home and looking in the light was already showing pilling. looks like it is worn in an bad way. returned the next day. this was a big disappointment and every time i see this fabric being used in retailer clothes it makes me mad.
4 I'm 5'7", 125 lbs and i ordered these in a size small. i just got them in the mail and the print is really pretty and they seem very well-made. unfortunately, they were a little too small, particularly around my butt. after i ordered them, i read reviews on other merchants' websites and saw that many other stores recommend sizing up, as the brand is known to run small. i wish i had known before i ordered, but i'm exchanging them for a medium and i hope those fit better, because this suit is ador
4 I am in love with this dress. ordered online in both my usual 4 and 6 (i go back and forth) and this time i kept the six. there is a little bit of stretch to the fabric but it has nice structure and the cap sleeves make it a welcome addition to my wardrobe. i plan on wearing this as a day-to-night dress since it's appropriate for work and for an evening out.
4 Someone returned my size so i got to try it on in store. the cut is very flattering, the material is stretchy. the lace part is nicely made too. overall great piece. the petite waist did hit me a little higher than on model, i have a regular torso and short legs (and overall usually need petite)
4 I'm 5-months pregnant and wanted some beautiful tunics to mix it up between the usual maternity wear. this top is lovely! i love the cut, length and embroidered details however i am not a fan of the side slits. this will work much better post partum so i plan to keep it but my belly currently pulls the slits a bit awkward.
4 I am 5'3" 130 and curvy and this dress fit me perfectly. it's great for parties and weddings (depending on how formal). the only reason i gave it four stars is because the fabric is a little strange; the ribbing for the squares is almost like a pillowy fabric, and it feels a little bit on the cheaper side but luckily it doesn't look cheap. nonetheless, i love this dress and would definitely recommend!
4 I loved the texture and look of this skirt. very classy. but it fits tight-- i usually take a 4 or 6 on skirts depending on where the waistband hits and i could barely squeeze into the 4 and could not get it zipped. i'd need to go a size bigger in this one but now it's unavailable :(
4 I adored this when i saw it online, paired with the leather skirt. i waisted impatiently for it to show up and, when it did, was happy at the price point but unsure of how it would feel. for the cut, i would say it runs tts. i am sometimes an xxs but in this case that size was tight across the shoulders. i am worried that the xs will be too roomy in the waist but time will tell. as for quality, well, you can feel the polyester in it, for sure. it's nice to have the lining, but i would not say it
4 This is a beautiful sweatshirt. that is a sentence i've never said before! mine arrived with the sleeves rolled up, which made me think they probably pulled it off a mannequin or something. it made the sleeves sort of loose at the bottom, so i am hoping that they will "draw up" a little once i wash it. kind of bummed about that: for almost $100, they could have at least steamed it out or something so i could see the authentic fit. the sweatshirt is a little more square-fitting than it looks in t
4 Wanted to love this dress. the fabric is very nice, pretty colors, great quality and style. it just didn't work for my body type. it would fit great on someone with narrower shoulders. probably want to size down.
1 An awful dress! retailer why didn't you post my last review. i would not even give it a quarter of a star.
1 I purchased this swimsuit in the mint. gorgeous color combination. i'm 5'5" and weigh 117 lbs. i purchased a small. the fit is true to size. i love the front design; however, my husband promptly brought the back of the swimsuit to my attention. the chevron was off center. the design should have been centered with my back; however, it was on the right side of my back. i immediately called retailer assuming the product was defective. the item was sold out on line; however, a supervisor was able to l
4 The only reason i gave this top a 4 star, is that it didn't have enough room around the bust area. i'm a d cup, and the front didn't button properly. but for the price i paid (40% off sale price), i have no coplaints.i would recommend.
4 Very pretty top. the fabric is wonderful! i enjoy the movement and the style. only downside is that it is cut a little low for me. but it does look great and the fit is, otherwise, perfect
4 It looks like the stores are finally receiving their supply of this really pretty dress. i've been watching its availability online and was getting frustrated. my local store had ample supply. it's a beautiful dress! as per an earlier review, it does run a little large. i love that it's made of cotton so it will be perfect in the summer and beyond. it's a full skirt but looks really pretty on. my local store showed it belted which looked good too.
4 I saw the "blue" version in my store (a return) in size 0. i decided to try it on and i loved it. it fit nicely, was comfortable and soft and the colors were flattering (and cut). (115 lbs, 30 dd, 26.5 in waist), i contemplated purchasing, as i thought it was a bit pricey, but usually i order petite versions. and it wasn't available in that size, until it was. and i ordered it. it came and the fit of that one was great in the legs, much nicer than regular, but the top part was a bit small. the a
1 Love the design of the fabric. i actually bought these in both colors. i gave only 1 star due stitching on the fabric, it's very scratchy.
4 Definitely a great silhouette. overall, it's just a really classic look that can hang around in your closet for years before it looks dated. that said, it runs small. i often have difficulty with clothing like this since i'm a 4-6 on the top and a 10-12 on the bottom (5'7" --- 35" 28" 41"!!!). my booty is definitely pushing some limits in this dress, but it does fit wearing a 6. shapewear to the rescue. conversely, my shoulders are petite, so the shoulders are a bit large. try this dress on in m
4 Another beautiful mave piece!! that is too big!! waiting for the size down to come in the mail. fingers crossed this works. the large was too overwhelming on my 5'6 frame. the tank that comes with it is soft and comfy and the gold accents really make this an outstanding number!! too bad no petite is offered. i ordered the black but it was hard to choose because the white also looks amazing. i predict lots of cooing over this lovely!!
4 Like the idea but the tee was was very boxy. i tried the size small and it fit at the shoulders but the body was very big. i would say they pinned it for the product photo:)i'm 34a...usually a size small. it was soft and fun but a no for me at this price.
4 I think this jumpsuit is different! the xs fit well and the material is a pretty color but very soft. the store had it styled with a metallic scarf that really accessorized it well.  i thought it would be great for my date night but stopped short of buying because i just can't picture this worn to other outings.  it is very unique though so i just might be back to purchase.
4 This is now one of my favorite items in my wardrobe!! it is comfortable yet can be dressed up or down to fit any occasion.
4 Since i only wear midi skirts, love the length of this one. the regular medium looks as pictured on me. well made and the dot texture is sweet. bui will be returning as the skirt is literally very heavy and the gathered waist is unflattering on me.
4 I really loved the pattern and style of this dress! unfortunately, i had to return it because i have broad shoulders and it is a pretty stiff top that cut into the flabby area near my armpits. for most people it's probably perfect! but if you have wide shoulders or any concerns about the armpit flab, this might not be a great choice for you.
4 Love the fabric of this button-down. runs really large, however. am usually a small or xs - so bought a 4. it's ok, but is incredibly boxy and stands away from the body -- & not in a good way. i think it probably works well tied at the waist, but, alas -- i am too old to be showing off that part of my anatomy. returned reluctantly! hope others will enjoy!
4 I was not impressed upon first taking it out of the package, it was a wrinkled mess,lighter weight than i imagined and i felt like it hung like a potato sack. however after i gave it a good ironing and used the inside back tie to sinch in the waist i was in love. it draped beautiful, the blue has beautiful embroidered detail and i love the full length sleeves that can be rolled. i feel iike i will use for many seasons.
4 This skirt is really beautiful but i agree with the other reviewers; it runs very small. i'm typically an 8 or 10. if i get a 10, there is usually a bit of room in the item. i decided to get a 10 in this skirt, just in case. i got it zipped but would have trouble breathing as the evening wore on. the pockets are wonderful and the fabric is weighty and really lovely.
4 The material is very soft and it looks just like it does on the model with the exception that it gets a little wrinkly at the hem and turns up at the corners. i like it and have already worn it a few times.
4 Beautiful color, great style/design. only drawback is it's not as soft as other cashmere i've purchased...got the xs and the fit is perfect!
1 Quality was not what you expect from retailer, especially for the price. top is lined but skirt is not. material is tissue paper thin and see thru. there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat, it keeps popping up. however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives. was returned.
4 Love these jeans however they get a little saggy in the front while wearing which i don't like :/
4 I love this dress! i purchased the neutral motif in a large and it fits wonderfully. i have a double d chest and the top of this fits almost perfectly. it's just a bit snug on top but still comfortable because of the fabric. i'm 5"3 and the dress isn't too long like most maxi's are on me. i always have great luck with maeve and plan on purchasing another right now!
4 This dress is so cute, and i received so many compliments on it! i wore it on a gameday, and it was so comfortable. i love the skirt of the dress because of the trendy v's. the top was too loose for me, so i had to get it taken in. this is surprising because i have a decent sized chest and broad shoulders. other than that, this dress is a real winner!
4 I am wearing a large in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.
4 I purchased this product online so wasn't able to try it on before purchase. it fits perfect. i am 5'7 and 160 lbs. the only thing i did not like was the fabric, it is very thin. you can see undergarment lines in the back.
4 I ordered this shirt through the website hoping it would look like it did on the model, it does! very nice, thick fabric. fits true to size, no complaints at all.
4 I'm not sure how i feel about this shirt. i love the fabric, which is soft, lightweight, and richly colored. the polka dot trim is quirky and fun, and i like the idea of the twisted hem. the cut is generous in width, for sure; i ended up ordering a small because i swam in my usual medium-to-large sizes, but the length of the small barely works. the sleeves are juuuust long enough, and the shirt hits me just at the hip, not nearly as far down as the model shots show. it may be because i'm busty a
4 Due to the prior review, this top came without any surprises.  i had read about the open sleeves and actually have a dress with a similar design.  this top can be dressed up or down and is perfect with skinny pants.
1 Retailer consistently provides unique, sophisticated and quality made clothing. with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies, i shop with them exclusively. i suppose that i can't expect 100% perfection from retailer-but 99% of the time-that's what i get. this is that 1%...this sweater is truly awful! i cannot (or find it very difficult at least) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that, had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front
4 This dress is really pretty and fun. i can see where i can dress it up or tone it down. subtle pretty beading at the neck. just ran a bit big on me, i sent back for the next size down -can't wait to get it!
4 This is very cute but runs small. my typical xs is too small all over. arms are short and top is short and tight. i'll order a small and hope it fits.
1 Do not buy this dress for full price. the design looks great but after receiving the dress, the material is made of extremely cheap slinky-ish polyester that you would find at a f21 store. the stitching is horrific and created an uneven "hump" on the back seam. just absolutely poor poor quality.
4 I don't normally like "lace-up" details, but for some reason, i don't mind it on this top. it's a bit shorter than it looks on the model (and i'm not especially tall). the fabric is nice - not too heavy, not too lightweight. great for fall.
4 I gave this 4 stars instead of five because the picture really does give you the impression that this "cardigan" has sleeves but actually it's a cape with a few stitches above the wrist. it's also quite short, i'm only 5 5" and it hits me above my waist. this picture was clearly shot with the front pulled down, i bet if we saw the back it would be high above her waist. also, one of the buttons fell off the first time i wore it. i heard it fall thankfully so it was easy enough to sew back on but
4 Super comfortable pant. they don't feel or look like jeans, but will hug your body like jeans. i bought the regular, size 26 - they waist is not tight and i needed to roll up the bottoms about 1.5 inches. i have not washed or dried these yet, but i imagine they will wash well.
4 I bought the blue and the white - the white is very sheer. the fabric is more scratchy on the outside than the inside - i wore it the whole day and it was not an issue for me.
4 Saw this in the greenville, sc store, and it caught my eye. i ordered a petite a week later, and i adore it. nice embroidery. a little sparkle. the sleeves are voluminous, but it makes me feel sassy.
4 Beautiful skirt but runs small. not for eveyone- this is for those with flat stomachs. i had to size up from a 6 to an 8 for my stomach to not stick out in this skirt and then it looked to wide on the bottom and lost the slick pencil look. if you are fit and firm this is a gorgeous skirt. it is lined and fabric somewhat heavy.
4 Top was featured in an email ad. i love the colors in both tops and bought both plaids. i'm 5'4", about 130 lbs, and the medium fits well. it is long in the back, but i like that. if the front were a little longer, i'd prefer that, but the length is ok. the colors are definitely cheery and mood-enhancing, very appropriate for this holiday season.
4 Love this dress!! i layer spanx and a seamless tank underneath, as the fabric would show everything if worn on it's own.
4 I wish i had sized up on this one. you can't tell from the photo, but has kind of a weird taper thing where the sides are shorter than the back. the back is extremely flatteringly, but the front... not so much. the shorter sides are a little awkward. there is no attached way to fasten this cardigan, and it lays kind of strange. the material is a medium thickness and i think will be very versatile. very soft, of course. i got the blue/ teal color. i found the color to be true to the color on-line
4 I don't usually have the best luck with pants from retailer but something made me try these on. i am so glad i did! i love the fit and the fabric, they are so soft and comfortable.. i loved them so much that i bought an additional pair of the grey wanted the turquoise but they were sold out of my size so i settled on the sand... i will definitely try other styles of the pilcro.
4 These fit much better than expected. they are made of a very comfortable lightweight fabric. not very substantial, but they will be great for the summer. i was worried that they would be too roomy in the hip area, but the cut is rather flattering. such a great deal at the sale price.
4 I really liked the fit and feel of these pants except the bottom of the pant leg was more bell shaped than i wanted (bought white pilcro culottes last year and they weren't like this), but it wasn't a deal breaker. when i got home, i tried to pair the chocolate pants with something to wear in the summer, but it wasn't working for me. i think the color was just too dark and fall-feeling. they do run big, so i'd think about sizing down ... definitely worth giving them a try if you're okay with the
4 This dress is fun to wear! i wear the purple one flowy and get lots of compliments. i haven't worn the navy yet, but when i do it will be belted. my only complaint is the material that is used at the shoulders shows bra/slip straps. luckily it isn't too noticeable but a design flaw worth mentioning nonetheless.
1 Beautiful fabric with soft drape. unfortunately the "captain kangaroo" pockets are awful. unless you have a straight up and down shape with no hips this is very unflattering. the pockets look like saddle bags and add a huge amount of fabric where most people don't want added bulk. very disappointing. returned.
4 This top does look better online and one reviewer said. it also looks good in-person but runs small. i usually wear xl, in some cases l. i tried l, it was small so i sent it back for xl. the xl fit perfectly at the top but was tight at the bottom. the bottom pulled at the seams, so i am sending it back. the embroidery itself is very pretty, it is a nice dressy top that can be worn with multiple colored pants or leggings. it just didn't fit me at the bottom. i think it would work better for a lea
4 My only reservation is that i wish the tail wasn't so much longer than the front. i returned it reluctantly because i needed something just a little dressier for the occasion.
1 This is a very awkward and unflattering shirt. i am very petite--90 pounds and 5'2". the arms fit--length and width, but nothing else about this fit. the scoop was so low and wide that i would require a shirt underneath. it fell exactly like a tent and made a bell shape around my thighs. yikes! it looks cute on the model, but not on me. the material is also very thin and felt sort of like it should be a pajama top.
4 Great fit in waist, hips and butt. i wore them all day and they did not stretch out.i am tall but the length of the jeans with the cuff is a tiny bit past my ankle bone. i want it just above the ankle bone so i am re-doing the cuff slightly and then i must send these to my tailor to close the cuff completely. they look silly when the big cuff isn't at least tacked in place. perhaps by design they were left this way so each of us buyers could find the proper length and close the cuff ourselves.
1 This blazer looks great on the model and i have a long torso so i thought it would be perfect. when i got it it looked like a big box and didn't fit anywhere. the shoulder pads were giant and the bottom of the coat was huge. i got a small based on other reviews, but it was way too big. sadly, i had to return it.
4 This is a cute top with jeans for spring and summer, or warmer climates - very fresh and airy. the fabric hangs nicely and although it is lightweight, it is not too thin or see through. ii does not get overly wrinkled either. the style is flattering for most body types and it can be dressed up or down. the v neck is just right: not too deep that you feel like you are showing too much cleavage, but deep enough to be feminine and slimming. i normally wear a size s in retailer tops and blouses
4 Dress is darling and well made. however, it runs very large. i tried to size down but then it became a little short in xsp. would be great for taller slim women. the style is so cute. the online picture does not do it justice.
4 I really love how comfortable and versatile this dress is. the midi length is perfect for booties or flats, and the cowl neck is loose and fluid, so it lays well. the only complaint i had, and it's minor, is the tulip skirt doesn't stay closed well when i walk or sit, which reveals more inner thigh than i am comfortable showing. i have to be very mindful of the skirt all day (i teach high school).
4 Very pretty fabric and beautiful color, but i agree with the other reviewer here, the fit is a bit strange. the waist is very small - need to size up at least one size for that to fit - while the rest fits nicely. it's also a little longer than i had expected...sort of looks like it should be a couple inches shorter (and i'm 5'11"!).
1 I tried this blouse on and loved the style, comfort and color of the peach so much that i was preparing to buy it. when i pulled the sleeve the fabric came away from the cuff. i tested another spot pulling only gently and the same thing happened. too bad since the color would have been a great addition for me. but--i also tried the blue and it gets 4 stars, as the fabric is much better. it too is adorable, soft and did not tear on gentle testing. the two blouse colors are made from different
4 I usually wear 26 or 27 in pants, but i sized up to a 28p for these. the waist is a little big but better fit overall. i ended up buying them in the white also.
4 Very cute top. flowy and feminine. love that it has the little clips on the shoulders to attach to your bra strap to keep the sleeves from falling down.
4 This top is cute! it adds a pop of color to my day and seems to be of high quality. the colors seem more vibrant in person and the material is quite soft and stretchy. as another reviewer pointed out, the peplum is only in the front! it sounds really weird but i don't really mind the look because i'll be wearing a jacket over it. i'm usually a size 12/14 with a 36dd bust and the large fits beautifully.
1 The jeans look so different online! the pair i got did not have the stone washed look and was completely different cut. the rise is not as stated and is actually 10.5 inches! also, i'm a true 25 and the waist is like a 27, but the legs are super skinny. i'm so disappointed and i'm not even sure if is worth swapping out for a smaller size. these look more like men's cut jeans.
4 The texture, mixed yarn, and beading make for a lovely variation on the fairisle. as other reviewers have said, the length is not as long as it appears in the picture. the color is a very dark navy, almost black. the neck opening is larger than a standard crew sweater but lays mostly flat. the overall look is boxy. i'm 5'7 and normally wear a medium in retailer sweaters. i changed to a large so it would be longer and have a roomy drapy feel.
4 This top is cute - nice fabric and design. pretty flattering for such a loose cut. my one concern though, was that when i was moving the peplum part kept riding up. i felt like i would constantly have to readjust the shirt to make sure it was lying flat. the shirt runs large. i'm usually a 6, and the 2 was plenty roomy.
4 I love these joggers. they are stylish, comfortable and high quality. my one complaint is that the sizing appears different for different colors. i got them in the green/moss color,. i immediately wore them casually with flats, a t, & a long silver necklace. that night, i literally just changed into a long, flowy silk cami and high suede black shoes with the joggers and wore them out- feeling comfy and pulled together (favorite combination). i loved them so much i decided to try the othe
4 I found this dress to be shapeless on (even when the belt was tied). i love the tshirt material and the fact it has short sleeves. it's just too boxy.
4 I bought this dress because it looked sooo comfy. and it is! the fabric feels nice and it fits loose without feeling like a burlap sack. it's perfect for running around town for errands. i actually didn't think my boyfriend would like it because he generally likes more form-fitting pieces (yes, big surprise) but he actually commented out of the blue that it's really sexy. comfy *and* sexy?! score!
1 This is the most unflattering peplum top i have ever tried on. fit perfectly as a size 6 should in the arms, shoulder, chest... then the waist was huge! just hung off of me like a flour sack. it was wider than the chest measurements, which made me appear frumpy instead of tailored and classic. combine that with the high-low hemline and it looked like a project runway reject. sent back immediately, do not buy this if you have (or want to appear to have) an hourglass figure, it will do nothing for
4 I am hippie and always worry about coverage. this was a nice fit, good coverage but did not look old-ladyish.
4 Very soft, first thing i have to say, but runs a little big, especially in the sleeves, i ordered the xxs p and the sleeves still bunch a lot at the wrists. also, other bummer is how sheer the ivory fabric is, i wish it had more substance for the price. but, i like the style and color combo. classic look, effortless, and can be paired with so many things. the regular size neckline was too low for me. the length on the petite was fine, not too short. so i say it runs big.for reference, i am 1
4 I was on the fence about this dress - i wanted something nice but casual for a family graduation. i'm glad i took the chance once it went on sale! the fabric is not as thick as you'd expect for a "sweater." just thick enough to hide any imperfections, panty lines, etc. i plan to layer with long sleeved tees or a jean jacket. i think it will do great through fall with tights and a turtleneck.i'm 5'6', 135 lbs, 34b and the small fit perfectly. i am "pear - shaped" by conventional standards, bu
4 I love this dress, but have found that this brand runs large. i'd order a size down.
4 I really wanted to like this dress. the material, design, length and fit all over was perfect, except for the armholes- too big and the ruffles came right upto the nipple line. not comfortable with that. sadly, had to return.
4 I love the print and style of the skirt. it is very cute and feminine and can easily be worn into autumn. the downside is that the elastic waist is a little too loose and needs to be tighten. also, the is a lot of extra fabric in the skirt and makes it look so much larger than it is and it runs about 3 inches longer. for reference, i'm 5'5, 34 24 35 and the xs is loose in the waist. still, i really love the skirt and plan on keeping it and having it altered.
4 Cute summer/vacation dress. lightweight material but not flimsy. i'm normally a xs/s and i ordered the s petite which was right b/c i think the xs would have been too clingy looking. the regular length would also have been too long.
4 These "jeans" definitely look more like pants and are very snug, but stretchy. i'm 5'10 and ordered the tall, and mine are a little longer than shown on the model. they look nice on, but are a tad tighter than i anticipated.
4 I received this product and love the color and sheen of it. it is not too flashy, and would work great as a dress to an event day or night with the right accessories. i am about 5'7 and 115 lbs, and usually wear a size 0 in dresses. the size 0 fit, but was a little loose. if they had a 00 it probably would have been too small though. you definitely cannot bend over in this dress because it is too short, but i didn't feel it was inappropriately short otherwise. it flares out just slightly on the
4 I'm usually a 2-4 in retailer dresses and i was surprised how well the 2 fit. i like that the dress is navy instead of black, which makes it even prettier.the embroidery is very nice without being too much to wear for more casual activities. fabric is thick enough for wearing out in autumn with some tights and a sweater. prettier in person.
4 A classy t-shirt - can go from work to casual.the gray and mauve were both drab in color and hard to pair with neutral dress pants.i chose the white. it definitely runs large, so size down (i.e. wear m/l, chose s).the fabric is linen, very itch, so tank is probably needed underneath.flattering fit for curvy figure.
4 When i first saw this in the store, i loved the idea of this shirtdress with a twist. i tried it on in my usual size 4 but could not get it over my 32d bust. i wrote it off and moved on. back in the store shopping for a party dress, i saw this was now on sale. although not right for the party, i decided to try it in a bigger size. a size 6 was not available but a size 8 was. perfection! if you are willing to size up, you will be rewarded with a comfortable, versatile dress that can be super casu
1 When i tried it on, it was a bit shapeless, but it was on a promo so i decided to get it. i kind off like shapeless. i've worn it three times and washed it gently in the machine as recommended (in a lingerie bag, always) and air dried it. it now has a huge rip on the sleeve seam, and i cannot see how this happened. the inner lining is soft and substantial  but the outer gauze layer is thin.
4 This is an adorable top, but it just wasn't my style. i'm 40 and felt silly wearing a big bow, but if you can rock this look i'd recommend it. the top is a thin sweatshirt material, not a knit sweater or a thick sweatshirt fabric. it is a cotton rayon blend. the sweatshirt part is cropped, but the striped shirt details come to a good length. the shirt trim is 100% cotton. the fit was true to size. it is a bit loose, not overly fitted, but true to size. it nips in a bit at the waist and then flar
4 Warm, asthetically pleasing and super comfy. i love the combination of style and comfort together. this sweater is a must have.
4 Love this top. very flattering on an hour glass figure because even though it has a more of an empire waist it is not so volumous as to overwhelm the figure --as so many retailer tops are these days. one caution: i had to go up a size to accommodate my bust.  normally a size 6 or small in retailer tops but a 34dd, so went up to a size 8.  the top is more snug around the bustline so just be warned if you are well endowed.  the fabric is sheer but not overly so, embroidery is well done. over all a b
4 This is a great dress that i wear to work, but would also wear to a cocktail party or wedding. it rides up a tiny but, but is long enough that i feel completely comfortable. it is tiny up top so i'd recommend ordering up if you have any chest - i'm 5'4", 100lbs, bra size 32b and it was a two-person job to get the bodice zipped.
4 This top was different than what i normally wear but based on good reviews i purchased. i really love it. it is different than i thought it would be. i thought it was longer sleeves but it is just above the elbow. definitely need a tank or something underneath as it is see through and the sleeve holes are quite large. definitely recommend.
4 These jammie pants are quite beautiful and comfortable. the material used is great, very light and thin. i found these to run really big though, definitely order a size down!!
4 I took a risk on this one. i wasn't sure if the shirt was more green or more blue. i look better in blue. it turns out that the shirt is a bit more green, but i think it still looks good! i'm 5'3' and 125 lbs. i got a medium. i could have maybe gotten a small, but i like the medium. the shirt has a bit of a vintage look to it, which i like. all in all good.
4 This is the first maxi i purchased this summer. i went with a petite as the regular length would need to be altered and i didn't want to lose some of the pattern on the bottom. it is a beautiful flowy dress. no need for a slip. it has beads on the bodice. i kept the dress but it is tight at the chest area and sizing up wouldn't have made that much of a difference..kinda uncomfortable in the chest area. has yet to be worn so may return..
4 If your looking for a nice quality basic tee, this is it. nothing special, but the fabric is a nice soft cotton with a little stretch. the cut is long and lean so i would highly recommend sizing up. i sized up from my usual medium to a large and it's still quite form fitting. i'm 5'2", 35a/b bust, 28 waist, 39 hips.
4 Falls beautifully and the color is vibrant. can be dressed up or worn casually. texture adds even more uniqueness. a little heavy but this is outweighed by its other lovely features.
4 For reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40.
1 I was really excited to get this dress, i initially ordered a small (i am a size 4) but when i tried it on, it was really tight. the bodice at the top fit strangely-i had to shorten the straps quite a bit, and the dress just looked off. i love retailer and get all of my dresses from there, and the look of the dress on line was beautiful, but just didn't fit right. i did love the lace look, and would love seeing more dresses with this design.
4 The buttons on the side give this top style. great color and fabric make it perfect paired with denim.
4 A comfortable shirt that has a touch of dressy to it.
4 Loved this dress! material is soft... the overall fit is great! the challenge with this dress is the side slits... they do go pretty high... too high for church but may wear them with leggings as it gets cooler... super cute with or without belt 5'9 135 lbs and i ordered a small.
1 Beautiful jacket and i got lots of compliments. true to size. it's not thick but it's very warm.
1 I bought these and returned them almost immediately. the material looks nice, but itchy and heavy. the fit is too small and just uncomfortable to wear.
4 Very comfortable and soft. i wish the neck was a bit lower and it runs on the large side. i am 5'7" wear a 10/12, i ordered the l and it was very big on me, will try it in the m, though i'm worried that it will be too high in the waist on me.
4 I saw this and had to have it!  it is so beautiful.  it has pops of color that can be paired with so many options.  i like the uniqueness of the flowers being on the backside.  it is thinner fabric, so i will have to wear a black cami underneath but i have no problem with that.  especially, going into cooler weather anyway.  it is very flattering on.  this one will go fast.  thank you retailer!
4 I love this jess. i got it in the blue gray color, and i think it's going to be great for spring and will work into summer as well. cloth and stone is always one of my favorite brands and this dress is so soft. i'm thinking that i'm going to belt it to give it some more shape but i like how it looks unbelted as well
4 I purchased this skirt on super-sale but i'm hesitant to keep it. it's not poorly made, just not as sturdy as i would expect a skirt of its price. that said, it's cute and comfortable. i wish it came in numbered sizes because the m is snug but i expect the l would be too big. has a good amount of stretch. shows underwear lines. love the style!
4 I'm not usually a fan of simple crewneck sweaters but this one has some nice added details that make it a keeper. the dark red oxblood color is really nice (it manages to be a red sweater without feeling overly holiday), the detailing at shoulder/chest is interesting yet subtle enough to not be distracting and doesn't feel bulky at all, the dropped shoulder seams are done correctly and without the body becoming boxy. it does feel like it might run a tad bit large, but only very slightly, not eno
1 I was surprised at the positive reviews for this product. its terrible! it cuts you in a weird place to make you look wide. the skirt is also not like the picture. its darker and heavier. the material isnt great. i had to return.
4 Very versatile skirt that's suitable for any occasion or any season.
1 Do not waste your money on this.at first, i bought pilcro hyphen chinos short and i loved it. so i bought this pants in store too. i laundry them yesterday and they both came out colorless. i was so shock. fyi, i did not use bleach or chrolox, i mean i don''t use them.i will return them both.still mad. this is bad quality enough worth it.
4 This is a really pretty print on a decent top. the only reason i returned is because it didn't look good with my skin tone and the fabric is thin. i'd planned to use it as a later under cardigans.
4 The high/low hem is interesting, and the fit looks great. i did find that i needed one size larger than normal.  maybe that's bc these are high rise?  there is also absolutely no stretch in the fabric.
4 This is a nice sweater. runs a little larger than size.
4 Love the floral pattern.  top is loose and flowy, as expected.  i like to tick it into my jeans or shorts, so it doesn't look quite so shapeless on me.
4 I tried this on today and it was awesome! great color, great fit, thin summer material but not too thin that it was see through. the slits added a really nice design to this dress, very slimming. my problem is the deep v in the front. for small busted women this might be a deal killer. for me in the xs the v hung even below my boobs, no cami could fix that. unfortunately, cloth and stone tend to make their shirts and dresses with too deep a v, it's always disappointing for me because i love thei
4 Bought this sweater on sale off the website. it fits perfectly - nice length. as some others said, a little scratchy at the neck but certainly tolerable - just need to wear a cami or tee underneath. the collar is a nice shape. fabric is a little stiffer than it "looks" in the photos.
4 I really love the way this sweater fits. the only negative is that it fits rather tight on the shoulders?i have broad shoulders and the sweater fits fine when my arms are down but a little tight when i raise them. but the size small fit well everywhere else, so i'm keeping it. the orange color is pretty but kind of glows a bit, but wish i'd also gotten it in the blue-green. very pretty and feminine, great with pants or skirts. i'm usually a small or medium (often just for shoulders) but got this
4 I like this comfy top. i bought it to wear with a cute pair of gold charlie cropped pants i bought from retailer last fall. the only thing i don't like is the odd length of the sleeves. they are somewhere between elbow and 3/4. i am a true xxsp in most tops, but the sleeves end right at my elbow making it difficult to wear them unrolled. for reference i am 5'1" and 107 lbs. a larger size would have been too wide and roomy. overall, i am happy with my purchase.
4 This is a cute and quirky feminine top with the ruffle detailing and polka dot flannel inside the sleeve cuffs. i wish it was little longer and maybe not flannel, then it would be perfect, but overall i liked it. i am 5'5", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame (plus a relatively short torso) and the small fit throughout the shoulders and chest.
4 Normally i would take a size 0 or xs in dresses, but after reading the reviews i am glad i took a size larger. the 2p worked out very nicely and i am 5'3 102lbs. it is a bit stiff when i walk around in it and losses some of its shape. don't get me wrong but i love the dress and am always receiving compliments on it.
4 As other reviewers have mentioned, this dress runs extremely large. i'm a solid medium in maeve dresses usually and got this dress in the store in a size x-small... and took it to my local seamstress to get it taken in! i get that this is supposed to be a "swingy" and "airy" dress but there was just too much space and material for me. i loved the top and the soft material so i am ok with spending money to get the waist taken in. i think this would be the perfect dress for someone with a slim fig
1 My husband never has anything negative to say about my clothes until i wore these pants! they are not flattering and kept stretching out until i could pull them off without unzipping them! baggy in the behind and sloppy looking. they are going back asap!
4 I'm 5'5" and about 115, 35-36" hip and small bust - the xxs petite is a nice fit, and doesn't hang straight down as it does on the model. it has some shape around my hips, and the slit is slightly above my knee, overall legnth also shorter than shown (good). it's not colorfast when you receive it, so be careful wearing light colored underwear (and maybe wash with only very dark colors the first time or two). i tried a regular xs in store at first, and it fit more like the photos - more of a beac
4 This is basically a poncho with arm holes. but it looks great and is well-made. i got this in the wine, which is a beautiful color. the design is nice and looks expensive (but i'm not sure how it will hold up after washing), it is oversized and a little boxy. i'm a medium or large on top and i ended up purchasing an xs and it fits just fine in the shoulders and arms. the rest of it is still roomy (though short) but perfectly fine. i got this on sale, so it was well worth the price point.
4 It looks a little more dressy in the picture but it's cotton, soft and very comfortable.
4 Had to have this dress as soon as i saw it in store. i am heavy chested (40dd). bought it in an xl. it is so colorful and vibrant. dress would look good on any skin tone. love that it is a shift dress. perfect with sandals or wedges.
1 Ordered a l and xl, the sleeves were so tight on both sizes but the rest of the shirt was wide and loose. the tight sleeves were not proportional with the rest of the shirt. both sizes had to be returned.
4 This dress runs tts. the fabric is a good quality, and it has pockets. i am about 5'5", and it hit just above the knee. i really wanted to keep it, but it hit me at an odd spot and not on my waistline. this made the dress look awkwardly full and me look hippy (despite the fact that my waist is 26" and my hips are 35").
1 I bought this dress because i saw it in stores when it first came to retailer. it was stunning. the colors were vivid and the beading was intricate. i regretted not purchasing it immediately. fast forward to today... the dress i received was not the one that was originally in stores. the fabric was different, there was hardly any beading, and the colors were washed out and dull. i read previous reviews saying that the dress was more like the studio pictures than the original promo. but t
4 These are perfect with a long tunic for the weekend to run errands! they are not tights-like in the sense that there's full coverage across your bum -- no accidental flashing of anyone. they're not itchy either. i bought these in brown, and want to buy the rest of the colors available!
4 Very happy with the fit, sizing, and look of these shorts.
4 Ok, so yes, it is true that the top part where the sleeves are can be snug a little, especially if you work out, but overall i found the top to run true to my regular size (i only tried on the 0, didn't try bigger). the length was great for me being short, i didn't think i need the petite (i usually do for pants and skirts/dresses, tops on and off). the look of the shirt is also classic, flowy and it looked great with e half tuck. the embroidery is also nice though one part of it seemed loose. a
4 I really wanted to love this dress. the cut out design is beautiful and it is very feminine. however, it does not really cut in at the waist and it left me feeling a bit boxy. i think if it cinched at the waist, it would be perfect. it didn't work out for me, but i think on the right girl, it would be very cute.
4 Love the fabric & lace on this top. like other reviews said the arm area is tight where the lace meets the fabric which makes the fit uncomfortable. sadly this top is going back. if you have very skinny upper arms this top will fit fine.
4 I saw this top in store and immediately picked up the red one. i am usually a 6 in tops sometimes an 8 but ended up with a 4.  feels a little snug in the armpit area but doesn't look it. i ended up getting the honey color one which looks great with white and army green pants. i loved the red one but felt like i was wearing a picnic blanket. it is a little flimsy and probably won't last that long so if you want to wait for it to go on sale and hope they have your size i would do that.
1 I ordered this tee despite the price. the fabric is very thin and the quality was poor. nice concept for a tee, but failed in quality and value. it was returned.
1 I sized down as other reviewers suggested (usually an 8, went down to 6) and the dress fit fine--but it was not attractive. the cut was like a tent with an empire waist. really just not attractive. maybe it has to do with my body type, but compared to the model, this dress was so unflattering in-person. returned.
4 This is a cute top. not perfectly made, a little boxy, but also not a crop top on me (5'5). it looks cute with high waisted jeans.
4 I like this sweater vest - really nice quality. looks great with ankle lenght jeaens and booties or a shorter skirt as shown on the model. quality is really nice - it's fairly heavy. i love the slits on the slide. i do find it runs a big large.
4 This chambray halter top is a good summer staple from cloth and stone, but, it is better for longer waists than mine (and, smaller busts). fyi: 36c, broad shoulders/back, short waist - normally i wear a m in c&s, and that is what i tried in this halter top.oddly the overall length was okay, but the armholes were very low. in the m, the bust area was tighter than it should have been for a easy summer top. i think that this is due to the overall length of the bodice. in other words, the top ha
4 Loved this romper! wish it was offered in petite... arm sleeves are too long once it's off shoulders.
4 These pants are great, as is the case with most c of h jeans.  they are a perfect length if you are 5&#39;5&quot; or shorter (i.e. you don&#39;t need to cuff them several times).  i love the relaxed but chic look.  they run large so definitely size down at least one size.  so happy they were on sale!
4 Green color is fantastic - dark forest green. material, wool, is substantial and of good quality. however, on my 5'1", 120lb athletic frame, i felt both the petite xs and petite s were too small for me when worn over a v.v.v. thin ls t-shirt. i also thought it was a bit too short in the back. the petite medium would have been a great fit for me, but all gone.
4 I first ordered this in the patterned denim. the online photo looks washed out in comparison. the blouse has very pretty detail all along the body and cute brass buttons. the pattern unfortunately looks more vivid in person and as result, i did not like. i brought it to the store and tried on white but it was very sheer (all though the pleating in front helps). i ended up exchanging it with plum which is also beautiful - not as much sheen as shown on the photo, but still beautiful.
4 The light red color is so rich! i would describe it as a burnt coral/red. i love the length - long enough to pair with leggings, but not overwhelming in my 5'3" frame. one sleeve began to unravel the first time i wore it, but i was able to mend it easily and have had no trouble since. i think it was a flaw specific to my sweater and not s general indication if poor quality. hubby says this is his favorite sweater on me too!
4 The issues the other reviewers mentioned didn't bother me as i don't have the prior years version to compare. i love the color and feel of the fabric.  a little heavier and great for early fall layering. the armholes weren't big for me but i got a small and would normally be a medium. the cut works great for a very curvy petite frame. it doesn't add bulk but does flatter a larger chest. i can see why this doesn't work for taller ladies as the pockets and hip do flare with the heavier fabric but
1 Although i love retailer, this product isn't the quality or presentation i expect from them. the dress arrived stuffed into a small plastic bag and was a crumpled mess. the fabric wasn't soft and fluid as i expected, but rather was stiff and a little scratchy. i purchased the ecru version, which was also slightly darker than the photo showed. i returned the dress and will keep looking.
1 This dress looked adorable online, but unfortunately, it's not flattering at all, and it's completely see-through. completely. the material is so thin that i can't imagine it would hold up very well over time. this one is definitely going back.
4 The fold over is so comfy. not the most flattering but really when you are wearing it you are going for comfort i think. bought these on sale and trying to decide if they are worth it or not
4 I saw this sweater coat in store and thought it was gorgeous! i was turned off by the price so i waited for it to go on sale. luckily, i snatched it up right away. as other reviewers have stated, it is meant to be worn as a coat/jaclket and for me the medium ( i am usually a size 8 or medium in retailer) fit was slighly oversized on my 5'9 145lb frame. i admit that this not an item that i would usually have in my wardrobe and was not sure how the sweater and the fit looked on me. i was afraid it w
4 Skirt is made well and beautiful colors. runs a tad small. i am typically a 4/6 and i ordered the 8 (based on other reviews) and it fit well.
4 This tank is great - goes well with black pants of skirt. it's a nice texture that doesn't show too many wrinkles so will travel well. it's a bit hard to get the buttons done in the back of the neck, but i assume that will get easier with time.
4 This duster is very nicely put together and is mid-weight. i'm not sure it's worth this price point but it's not cheaply made, either. the colors are as shown on the website to a 't'. the length is also as shown. i am 5'5 142 lbs and 34d and the small is perfect. i think if one is considering multiple layers underneath a medium would serve the purpose nicely but the small will accommodate a blouse or tee underneath and is just perfect. colors are dark teal, salmon and gold. this is a three seaso
4 I am 5'8 and 220lbs (extremely muscular) i ordered a size large and it hangs very nicely over my curves, the neckline looks pretty good with my broad shoulder, and the dress comes about 4 inches above my knee. i think people with curves would really like this dress but it does lack shape so beware if you're looking for something with some structure. the blue is gorgeous and the fringe details are very cute. this dress does seem to run a bit big.
4 This piece is a winner solely b/c of the sleeves. otherwise, it's a plain, large tee. however, the sleeves are gorgeous and so unique! had they had my size left, i would have purchased in other colors (i got pink). it runs large, so size down.
4 This too is great to throw on when running to class or going out. love the two different materials and the back detail.
4 This is absolutely a 1-season top. the material is very thin and flowy, with the front v plunging pretty dramatically. i'm using mine as a swim cover, and i'm thrilled to report the mottled pattern on the cotton hides perspiration(!)the first time i wore this top, i paired it with denim shorts, and the hemline completely covered the shorts, so it was way more of a mini-dress than a long shirt--which is ok. if i wear it again as a top rather than a swim cover, i'd just go with yoga shorts benea
4 The color was a little darker than it looks online, but i like it!
4 Love the rifle print on this dress. the fit is relaxed and very comfortable and can be adjusted with the tie in the back. the fabric is a nice weight, great for year-round wear.
4 I saw someone try this on when it was 40% off sale, and should ahve purcahsed it then... ended up going back today for it. it is very soft, adn flattering. also, i purchased the balck, this can go with pretty much anything: jeans, skirts, dresses, you name it - very neutral and flattering fit. nto sure if petite would have worked but too late anyway.
4 I am 5'10" 150lbs and size 8 fits me perfectly. the print is lovely and the fabric has a nice flow to it. at this price point the dress should have a lining.
4 These are nice, flattering short. however the colors and patters are not quite as pictured. i almost suspect they are slightly different on each short. exmaple: on the picture online the left leg seems to be mint green and the right one blue. the ones i received the left leg is a darker, bluishgreen color. the right leg is orange. i would hae prefered the colors on the photo but it is not a big deal i guess. i ordered the color block bra as well and it has the same issue: colors and patterns are
4 I agree with the review that says this is better in person than in the pic online. great sale price and super cozy but thin enough to transition to spring!
4 The shirt is a very cute cut. it "poofed" out a little more than i thought and kind of looked like a tutu. but, i wore it with white jeans to work and got a lot of compliments!
4 This is a very feminine and pretty top, but it runs really small. after reading the reviews, i ordered a size larger; however, i think i should have ordered 2-3 sizes larger.
4 I am usually a medium/large and was pleased to fit in the small/medium that i ordered after reading some of the reviews. lovely piece, great to wear over a short sleeve t-shirt, 3/4 of a sleeve shirt or even a long sleeve shirt when weather permits here in florida. very happy i ordered this!!
4 I needed this dress as soon as i saw it on a mannequin in the store. unfortunately, when i tried on my usual size (4 regular), the armholes were so big that you'd be able to see my bra no matter what. i purchased a 4 petite online later that day. it fits perfectly! i received so many compliments on this dress. a few issues though: (1) this dress wrinkles like crazy. i know it's linen, but i looked like a mess after wearing it for just a few hours. definitely don't wear it to work and expect to l
4 I really love the front of this shirt. however, the back of the shirt is more of a jersey material so it doesn't seem to match the front of the shirt. i still wear it and it looks cute, but it threw me off a bit at first.
4 Lovely, lovely dress, great quality. unfortunately runs rather large at the hips. i wear a size 2 and the xs fit well in the chest but large at the hips.
4 I loved this dress and i am usually a 2 or 4 in dresses. this was cut too small on the bust. i'm a 32c and it pulled at the chest. i didn't re-order it because i felt it would look more like a house dress and be too baggy in the hips.
4 I ordered the red motif in size xl. for me, the fit matches the model so i think it's true-to-size. the only larger area on me is for the armholes. i use a cami so my bra won't show when raising my arms. since it's made of rayon/spandex and is a longer length, it's a little clingy along my hipline for my pear-shape. but, overall, it's so soft and comfortable. the colors in the floral pattern are beautiful. prettier in person. there's no problem with pattern placement either. a great top for summ
1 I saw this at the store today. very excited about it but i had no idea how to get it on! there is a side zipper so i attempted to step into the jumper through the collar but could never get my arms through! from what i could see on my body, it would have been too short in the crotch. i decided not to fight with it to put on entirely. i gave up. cute shade of green though.
1 No. this is one of the most unflattering things i've ever put on my body. i'm a very well-proportioned hourglass - i tend to wear a small despite a booty and 36d chest - this made me look huge. don't do it.
4 I ordered size medium. the fit is true to size. the color and pattern work beautifully with the delicate yarns and design of this sweater. as other reviewers have stated, it is very thin and lightweight. in my opinion, it serves more as an accessory rather than it being functional as a cardigan worn for warmth. when i tried it on, i considered whether it would provide any warmth at all...summertime air conditioning, etc. the answer is no... if i decide to keep it, it will be for its aesthetic...
4 I love this shirt. the quality is great, and very soft. the length seems a bit short, i will only wear it tucked in to a higher waisted skirt. the arm holes are tight.
4 I agree with the other reviewer -- it's refreshing to find a top that isn't all baggy or sheer, which seems to be the current trend right now._______pros:- lots of stretch. this was so comfortable and the rayon lining inside really makes this breathable.- the ruched detailing, sleeves and overall length is great.- no cami needed with the white. i see in the pics on the model that appears to be cami underneath. i wrote a nude bra and didn't have an issue at the front because it's two la
4 This is a unique blouse and well worth a try. it is pure wool, so dry clean only. though it is wool, it is actually very thin and lightweight. i didn't find it to be scratchy..i am a size xl, but in this blouse the large fit fine. the narrowest part of this blouse is the width of the shoulders, everything else is very voluminous. for this reason, it doesn't flatter my full figure; it makes me look much heavier than i am. my only options are to return it, or bring it to a local seamstress who
1 Very poorly made- wide and short, very unflattering. the material is advertised as cotton, but it felt very synthetic.
4 Like other reviewers, i'm glad i sized down. this is a cute tunic that is definitely great quality, lightweight chambray. i love that it has pockets, but they do puff a bit at my hips.
4 The previous reviewer was right on with her review, including that the shirt is a bit darker in color irl. i'm writing this review to emphasize how large this shirt runs. i'm typically a small in shirts, usually a 4 and occasionally a 6 if it's a very fitted style. i'm 5'5", 125lbs, 34b, and i went with the xs in this, and it is huge on me. i really like it though, so i'm considering reordering in an xxs, i've never worn an xxs. i'm starting to get frustrated with inconsistent sizing, especially
4 Adorable skirt but fit is definitely too tight like the other reviews before me  i am super petite 4 11 105 pounds the double zero and zero were just a little tight for me and a little too long ( both could fit around my waist which is a 24 but high waisted and tight not a fit around the hips) if  the length had been above the knee i might have kept  the zero but they were both returned  great skirt in the theory  with the wrong  waste fit and length
1 This dress is thin and completely see through. it is definitely not worth the price tag. would be really cute in a thicker material.
1 I bought a pair of these a month ago and first time i washed them they came out with light spots all down the leg. i figured i did something wrong so i bought another pair in the same color and one in sage. just washed both pairs according to care instructions (no spills, stain remover, or anything but detergent) and both came out with light spots all down the leg. very sad to have wasted all that money.
1 I was really disappointed in the shirt. the blue embroidery is a lot darker than what is shown in the photo, and barely stands out against the black. the photo does not accurately depict this shirt. i will be returning.
4 I didn't expect to love this dress.. i assumed it would be something i'd return. this dress is so cute on! i love how well it fit me and that i could dress it up for work with booties, or pumps and a cardigan or dress it down for happy hour or a baby shower. i ordered a small ( i am 5'4 and 130 lbs) and it fit me like a glove....good job maeve you did it again!
1 This top was a big disappointment. i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size 16. neither of them fit well, but one was cut much smaller than the other. i've had this problem with all of the numerically-sized buttondown style of maeve tops. i don't understand why in size 14 & 16, this keeps happening. that's why i purchase two of each. usually one fits and the other doesn't. this time, unfortunately, neither worked. they both were too tight in the arms/shoulders
4 I have many left of center tees, and this one is a part of that same family. i got the deep purple (kind of an eggplant color), which is perfect for fall. the sleeves are long, the cotton is thick, and i love the small details at the neckline and bottom hem. it's not quite 5 stars for me, though, because it is very high on the sides--not too much that you can see skin while standing still but enough if you raise your arms. not a deal breaker for me, though.
4 Absolutely love the diagonal zipper. it is extremely flattering for the office, and comfortable. a great layering piece with a simple blazer, or alone. looks high quality. my only one minor complaint is that the bottom tends to move away from my body, as the top is wide on the bottom. hence, gives you a lot of leeway in the stomach area. may not be a good thing, or may be a good thing. still, overall, a keeper.
4 This top is such a great color and style. i did have to go a size down, as i typically wear a medium. the style is very forgiving. it looks great with shorts and jeans! it's staple!
4 I had been eyeing this top for awhile so decided to snag it when it went on sale. i'm still on the fence. i love the material and pattern but it is really long, and i'm 5'10". it looks very roomy with jeans but i still want to try it with tights and boots to see if that looks better. overall i think it is a great piece.
4 Love this dress but wish the lining was full length - will be removing this liner and using a different slip underneath!
1 I wore this suit for the first time yesterday and the black inner lining is leaking and causing stains on the white sections. seriously bummed as this is a super lovely suit.
1 I initially saw this top a few months ago, and fell in love. it ended up selling out in stores, so i ordered it online, where it was back-ordered by a couple of months. i received it this past week, and was sadly disappointed. the design is pretty, but overall the quality is sorely lacking. i wonder if maybe the first batch was good, but when they realized they were so popular, and had more made, the newer batches weren't as good? not sure. the one i got had inconsistent red embroidery, and ther
4 This top is adorable; fits like a glove which makes me a little nervous...there were no washing instructions attached so i will hope for the best. the quality of your garments are always excellent; its only the risk of buying on line (sizing) which makes me hold my breath until i can try my order on. it is a joy to get items that fit from retailer, my favorite online store!
4 This socks are very comfortable however they do feel a little big around the top so for people with a small lower calf might find them a bit big. that being said they are very comfortable.
4 I would give this top a 4.5. it is a very pretty top, i love the embroidery, but runs a little short for my taste. it still meets past the top of my pants, but barely. this is why i didn't give this top a 5. i am 5'9" so i think for a petite person the length would be perfect.
4 I tried on the dress that was returned at my store in xxs p, i would not have based on reviews but my stylist asked me to try it on. it does look nice, you just have to cinch it all the way. perhaps most people do need to size down. for my 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5in waist, i wouldn't go up to xs p... to give an idea. material is nice and sturdy. give ti a try!
4 Super cute retro styling and i adore the pattern however i had some fit issues that were worth noting. i tried the standard 6 on at my local store but the bodice was so tight on my 34 b chest. i was determined to get this lovely summer frock and had the sa order an 8p to be shipped to me. i'm currently taking my 8p for a spin today but only after some alterations: even through the dress was quite large in the bust, there was still the dreaded button gaping so i added 2 snaps in between some of t
4 I just got this top in store today. all the colors were "heathered ", pretty casual colors. the top is extremely soft and i would say true to size. love the flutter sleeves that give nice feminine details.  i hope it doesn't shrink in the wash and wears well! also, i found that the purple color seemed to run slightly smaller than the others? kind of odd, but i thought worth mentioning:)
4 Love this shirt, the material the design... but....i have not worn it yet... the side openings are strategically placed to show my least flattening angles, if you know what i mean. i will be sewing these two openings and hope the shirt still looks and fits beautiful.
1 Pants are overpriced and very uncomfortable. to my utter dismay i wore them during a business trip for the first time and ended up with bruises caused by the side zipper. i have been a long time retailer shopper and usually my go to store, however,ending up with a pair of pants that caused me pain was a very big disappointment,
1 I wanted to love this top -- looks so comfy and cute. but hangs like a bag. going back!
4 I like the shirtsleeves for south florida and the material. the design is great too. hits high up on my waist which i like. i ordered the black, but had to send it back as the medium was too big. i usually take a medium, but the small fits perfect. like white a lot and ordered the gold too.
1 I am normally a straightforward 10 - since i saw the other review i ordered down to an 8 - i am still swimming in it.i would say i have about 4 inches of extra fabric in the waist/hips. this is sized way too large. i love the softness of the checkers but i suspect this could get itchy fast on the arms where it touches the wool - but i won't find out cause i'm returning it?on the bright side i might fit a 6 which would be pretty nice.
1 This dress is absolutely hideous on my physique. ordered a size 6 and it hung on me like a cheaply made tent. i have an athletic built am a 34d. it is going back asap.
4 They look good in the front as well the back i would go a size down in them though as they stretch out throughout the day! i love hei hei and would recommend this pant
4 Love this casual and soft flowing top. its a nice loose fit. slightly big, however i'm petite. asymmetrical hem adds a unique touch. pairs well with a variety of denim skinnies...black, dark denim. planning to try with white ankle skinnies as well. the v-neck is just right. dips enough to show the neckline without revealing cleavage. it's the perfect lightweight layer for spring to fall. i even added a black blazer for a cool evening out. love this top and would buy in other colors.
4 I love this sweater and the sleeves are amazing. i also love the purple color, which is more of a deep maroon. the material seems to be of good quality. what i don't love about this sweater is the shape. it is very swingy, which is somewhat flattering because it isn't too clingy, but it poofs out a bit too much on the sides, becoming unflattering from certain angles.
1 Even on sale sale...this tank is not worth the money. the design in the back is adorable & would expect it to be so much better quality but the fabric is flimsy(think old man white tanks that come in a pack) completely see through and lack of shape..i wanted to love this but definitely photographed significantly better than actuality!
4 I bought the calia tunic in blk/wht and in red motif. i love the black and white one. the cut is flattering and stylish. comfortable. you can dress it up or down. all good. the red motif is cut differently. the neckline is very low. the shape is different from the black and white one. i am not sure why but i returned it.neither shirt is as long as the one pictured on the model. i would recommend the black and white one though.
4 Great top. i got the size 4 but i ordered a 6 and plan to return the 4 depending on how the 6 fits. the top is really cute but it fits just right and i would like a little more room. when i raise my hands the entire shirt raises up. otherwise cannot wait to wear it and this is a great purchase.
4 These pants are so comfortable and i love the color, but they did not work for me.
1 This dress turned out to be a huge disappointment!!! i was in loveee with the picture! in real life, not so much. the material felt thin and cheap! and the yellow was super yellow! nothing like the picture. i was so bummed! returned it earlier today...
4 This is a very pretty blouse and i like the mix of fabrics. i bought this in my usual size and it fit nicely except for the fact it is much too long. i have a short torso, and all this does it just cling and sit on my butt. perhaps this would work very nicely on someone that was athletic or tall and slender. sad to say, i had to return this because of the length.
4 Flattering fitted form. flowing fabric. well made. colors are true to pictures.
4 I am going to keep it. i think it will be a great "throw on and go" piece you can wear with many different types of shoe/sandal. the detail on top is excellent and it is a flattering cut. two complaints: runs a little big on bottom, a little "genie" looking...like there is too much fabric above the elastic around your upper ankles. but the bigger issue is that there is no zipper or elastic on top so slipping the top over your shoulders is super tight, to the point i thought i was going to rip it
4 A flattering soft basic! i'm 5'2" 120 lbs and purchased the small on sale.
4 These are really cute and done in a substantial knit type fabric that drapes well and doesn't cling. i ordered my normal size large. so i'd say they're true to size. the leg isn't too wide and bells out nicely toward the bottom. the color variations are striking but on me they made me look wider than i am. i'm short and the hem hit at the top of my ankle instead of the cropped look shown. think they'd look best with shorter tops. i decided to return but still highly recommend.
4 I love all of these dresses, ordered the ivory in 00p on accident, meant to order 0p. was too small, but 0p would have fit. it is flattering, the pattern of lace is great, but i didn't like the color as much in person. i think i would like the blue better.
4 This dress is navy and neutral stripes. not black and white. it fits true to the size width wise but is 2-3 inches shorter than the picture. to gain the length you might want to size up but it will be wider. the knot at the hip is beautiful and very flattering.
4 Order at least one size down or the double v neckline will insist on slipping off your shoulders. everything else about this top is great.
4 I bought this top in the gray color and my usual size large.   the fit is perfect.  i don't have the tight neck issue that another reviewer had.  there is an odd knitted neck that you can't see on the model since her hair covers it.  i love the softness, fit, and embroidery of the top, but was debating on returning because of that weird, stiff neck knitting.  my husband said that he really liked it, so i gave it a shot.  i'm wearing it right now and it's super comfortable. i don't notice the nec
4 Well, it's the snails that really make this cardigan special. the buttons and the open work stitching are nice too, and the fabric is soft and warm. a note on the sizing though - the style runs short in the torso and long on sleeves. so if you are petite like me and considering buying the regular size because the petite is sold out - you'll be fine with the torso length but will have to roll or scrunch up the sleeves. that's not too bad because the fabric is soft and easy to push up at the sleev
4 Mom loves these and she looks great going to the gym! the cut-outs are so cute!
4 First off - i love these jeans... they are the exact look i have been searching for, and the bands around the hem are what really sold me on this specific pair. the only problem - which i found with a previous purchase - is that they hit me at the ankle, rather than what is pictured. since i liked everything about these jeans, i decided to so with plan b and had them altered to be about an inch shorter. this involved cutting the hem at the top of the bands and reattaching... the stitching blends
4 Simple pull-on pant with a great design. they look flattering on and can easily be dressed up. i wear between a 4 and 6 and the small fit perfect. i have washed them and worn them several times and they still seem good as new. the wide elastic waistband ensures that they stay in place.
4 I know that some folks said it runs small, but i am usually a size small or medium in dresses and the medium feels big to me. that being said, it definitely works, and i think it'll be great. excited to dress it up with accessories- feels professional enough for me to teach in.
4 Bought this in xs petite - i'm 5'2", 102, it was too big, so took it to a tailor. altered it so that horizontal stitching at the bottom sits gently on my hips, rather than floating way out all around. it's now nice and flattering; i get tons of compliments. note that the fabric is more off white, than bright white; i bought it online thinking it would look good with white jeans - it actually looks best with blue jeans or navy shorts/pants. drapes nicely and doesn't wrinkle. a win!
4 Love everything about it but had to get a size bigger to be long an off/ to short for a mom. if i was 20 would be fine.
4 I had high hopes for this top. i love the plaid and design but found it too boxy and short. the front was cut too low as well.
4 I am 5"7" and weigh 123 lbs. i tried on both these dresses in medium, and they both fit. they are not too thin, not too high slit, not scratchy. the problem is i am middle aged with a thick waist. the waist looked lumpy with the close fit knit. if you are younger, slim and tall, you will love it. i sent it back with regrets. hope this helps.
4 I was pleasantly surprised by this dress. it goes perfectly from work to drinks and i receive tons of compliments on it. i pair it with a thin belt and heels or booties depending on the occasion. i ordered a small, it is a little big, but the fabric is stretchy (i am 5'4" 125lbs). this dress accentuates my upper half, while disguising my lower half--thanks, dress!
4 I just purchased this cute top at my local retailer store and definetely the size is way off! in blouses i wear a size 6 (small or medium) with a 34b bust, tall and slender and i had to purchase a size 12 (what????).overall so cute and could not pass it up. good luck. try it on before purchasing.
4 This top is so cute, but it is massively babydoll shaped (a- line) which is not apparent from the pictures. i measured the xs i have and the chest is about 42" and sweep is over 70". i would definitely keep this top if it hung straighter. the craftsmanship is lovely and fabric is so natural and handwoven looking. i'm thinking about asking my tailor if she can take the sides in, but that might ruin it as the fabric layout is cut and proportioned to this swing style.
1 I loved the idea behind this shirt but it just hangs around the waist with tons of extra fabric. i suspect the model in the photo has the shirt pinned. totally unflattering making the chest look small and your midsection appear huge. maybe if you size down it would be better- xs was not available for me to try. also the lavender color is really washed out...
4 I tried hard to make this work because it is beautiful, but ended up returning it. first, it is very delicate material - i was terrified trying it on. second, i just couldn't make the drawstring work for me to achieve the fit i wanted. third, it was too low for me and would need a cami over the slip. while i didn't think the colors were as deep as the picture, it was still pretty. i could have possibly gone down a size to fix some of my concerns, but then i know it would have been too short for
4 The petite was a little bit long on me (i'm 5'2), but it otherwise fits true to size and is very soft and comfortable, breezy. covers enough that it is work appropriate or for something outside. a keeper!
4 1. i'm 5'5" tall, 145 lbs, and 38-32-40 and the pilcro hyphen chinos and stet chinos fit me perfectly, if a bit loose in the size 30. the size 30 in this flare pant was snug in the hips and waist and loose in the thighs and legs. i could not tuck a shirt in.2. the front pockets with the leather trim are sewn shut. i'm fine with this, as it keeps the pockets aligned properly. however, there are still pockets on the inside incase you want to unpick all the stitching that's keeping the pocket clo
4 I like this dress very much. the colors are great and the style cute and casual. its perfect with a pair of cognac riding boots and tights.it really is depicted well in the model photo, although i think it may be cut somewhat shorter than it appears in the photo. i am 5'9" and its shorter on me than on the model who, i imagine, is taller than me.the dress is made of a substantial, tight knit material. i found it to be a bit boxy so i washed and tumble dried it, hoping to tighten it up a bit. t
1 I'm so disappointed this dress didn't work out! i ordered the size medium, post baby i'm a solid dress size 6 or 8 depending on the designer.the cashier was laughing with me how ridiculously huge this garment was when i held it up. also the length was super long, description says 35" which would be mid thigh for me, but this thing hit me mid knee. also, like the previous review the shoulders are tented and poofy. so bizarre and the cut reminds me of a maternity dress, but the shoulders def
4 I ordered this top in the solid navy. the quality seemed very good, and my overall impression was favorable. what i liked was that the top stayed off the shoulders even when i was moving. so many of the on-trend "cold shoulder" tops simply do not stay put with even the slightest movement. unfortunately, this top ran quite a bit large. if you are in between sizes - i definitely recommend sizing down. i've not seen the printed floral option, but the dark navy is lovely and looks chic with white bo
4 I am a solid size 6 in most brands, top and bottom, 5'3" tall, 125#. i have long legs, short torso, and fairly broad shoulders - i almost never wear petite sizes.however, this top in the regular small size could be a maternity dress on me! i am literally swimming in it, and it is quite long. however, i can still make it work, with a cami underneath and leggings or skinny jeans... i like it, did not return, and will buy another color, but will go with petite x-small in the future.
1 I'm 5'7" 155lbs and ordered a large. it fit, but the arms were awkwardly short. the finish details on the end of each sleeve almost would have to be pushed back to the elbow for it to look right, which would be okay. however, the interior seam of the neckline is cut jaggedly and isn't even finished with any stitching. it's just tucked haphazardly inside the neckline and isn't sewn--it would unravel with washing. it's soft and snuggly and cute if you get it on super-sale and don't mind it com
4 I love this blazer because it feels like a sweater but has the formal structure of a blazer. great for fall!
4 This sweater is a pretty color and style and is really soft and comfortable - i really wanted it to work. a small fit my 5'7", 140 lb frame well (32dd) but the ruffles on the hips were not a wanted addition unfortunately. . tried it on three separate times to try to change my mind but in the end, it's going back. i would not suggest it if you have an athletic or hourglass figure with even a little hip.
4 I received this in the mail a few days ago, and was so pleased with it except that it was huge! i am normally a 10/12 in most things so i ordered a large. i was swimming in it in all areas - shoulders and bust bothered me most because i need a waist on shirts so i don't look larger than i am. i liked it enough to o ahead and order a size down. i ordered a medium and medium petite because the top is quite long and i think i could get away with wearing it with leggings or tights if i were looking
4 But the back of it, by the waist, bunches just a tiny bit. if i get bigger, it will be too long. but i love the skirt, it is flattering and cute. not itchy for me even if the title says wool. i ordered the 00p and the length is pretty much as pictured, just below the knee in front. the waist is snug, bigger it would fall more on my hips (hence the too long comment earlier. (115 lbs, 26-27 in waist, short legs...)
4 The fabric is soft and the colors are bright. it fits well over the shoulders and the neckline is placed just right on the chest. the bottom portion of the tank is more of a swing style item than a form fitting tank. i am very pleased with the top and will wear it often.
4 I am usually an xsp or 0p but i ordered up one size (2p) due to previous reviews complaining about the tight slip. however i definitely did not need to size up. the slip is fine and the outer 'shell' is billowy and i should have stuck with my usual size! when i put it on i was not in love due to the dress being so roomy, but a second check in the mirror showed that the fabric / seams draped well and it overall looked pretty cute. it hits about 2 inches above my knees and therefore seems pretty p
4 I got the blue & it is so cute! i'm a very consistent 2-4 & i ordered a size 6 & that fit well. the a-line does stick out farther than it shows in the photos so i'm having that taken in some...looked like a triangle. it's definitely worth the price & super flattering!
4 The fabric is breathtaking, both the jewel tone colors and the burnt velvet that would flatter any skin tone. as usual, eva franco clothes run small so i went up a size, size regular 6 (i am 5ft2in, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips) fit well, the hem is below my knees, appropriate for work. but i think it would look better as a skirt or a sheath dress. the top part looks strange, does not enhance any curve and turns the dress to frumpy on short folks like me, thus one star off.
1 Dress is nice but can't be worn without tights or you are at a risk of indecently exposing yourself. it is around 30" in length so is more of a tunic than a dress. i'm only 5'1 and it was too short . can't imagine anyone taller even trying to wear this !
4 I ordered this in a large and its a super cute dress but this time the large ran super big! i usually wear a 10 so sometimes mediums are too small. i'm going to exchange it for a medium and see if that fits better. the beading detail is beautiful but just had too much fabric down below.
4 Nice lines and texture but fit is very tight and i experienced the sizing to run small. i am 5'6" and 115# with small frame. i usually wear xs or s from retailer, so ordered the turtleneck in small. the size small was super tight. i love the design so exchanging my order for a medium.
4 I saw the xxs petite in green in my store, adn decided to try this on only becasue it was a petite and in the store. i don't see green as an option nline anymore, so it must have been a old return... it is extremely soft, as others mentioned, and the fit is really flaterring. i bought it then read abou the rebviews, so will see... the fact that i bought the xxs, means it must run big!
4 In theory, this dress was perfect for me. the colors, the embroidery, the sheer top and keyhole back... so romantic! sigh. something about the fit just kept it from being a wow moment. i'm usually 10-12, the 12 was way too big, the 10 more fitted, but still it wasn't quite right. the sheer part dips quite low, and sizing down helped, but it could still be a lil dangerous. i kept feeling like it wasn't defining my waist enough and wanted a tighter waist and more full skirt. maybe i would have fel
4 The waistband is reminiscent of yoga pants except looser. i think these pants are a little large and wide-legged. i have a bigger butt and i like my pants on the looser side overall so maybe that is why they were super loose on me. i think they are a great way to get away with wearing casual pants when you need to dress up. i feel like they would look best on a taller person. i need to get them hemmed.
4 Love the shape of this top. i bought in white and a friend bought in the neutral pink. we both required a tank/cami to layer under it. i am 5'5", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and ordered a size small.
4 Loved the colors (greenish, coal and white) and shirt texture but the fit was horrible. i sized up to an xl because you can never tell sizing with this line. that didn't help. it fit, although a bit long but the deal breaker was that i looked huge from the side view. since i carry my weight in my mid section, high/low cuts on the side are tricky on my frame. it fit well in the bust over my 34g's and looked nice from the front. i do recommend it. if you have my body issues you might pass.
4 Cozy slouchy sweater. very versatile. fits tts, just as shown on model.
4 I am 5'6" and 140b, i'm usually a s and that is the size i bought. i loved the fit of the top and wore it immediately. then i washed it just as the instructions said and the liner shrunk about 3" (just as another reviewer stated) and the sleeves were much tighter and a little shorter. however, i loved the top so much that i took the top back to the store and exchanged. the store was super understanding about it and i was able to order the same size. it's back ordered, but once i get the new top
4 This sweater is very comfortable and soft. unlike other reviewer, i did not find the lace to be itchy. i'm 5'4", usually size 6; decided to order medium to give it a nice and relaxing feel. this way i find it to be not too short nor fitted. it's easy and relaxing but the lace makes it a little more dressy. not sure how it's going to handle the wash.
4 I kept the size 8 of the dress and had to return the 10 as it was too roomy at the arms and chest (which is great!!!). material is nice and not too much material, hangs nice (its a swing). another win!
4 This shirt is very comfortable. though it's casual, its uneven seams and asymmetry give it a littlemore edge and character. fit is slightly large. i'm 5'5'', 125 lbs and purchased the small. the arms are a little longer than i'd like and the overall fit is slightly too loose. however, it's not a significant enough problem for me to return the shirt.
4 Very cozy lounge tee, but runs large. i ordered a small rather than my usual medium and could of probably went down two sizes.
4 This should be a good dress for hourglass figures. runs a bit narrow in the ribcage, so you may want to try a couple of sizes. i'm 5'2", currently 33-25-37 or 38 with a 28" underbust, 28dd/30d/32c bra. normally a 0p or 0 in these type of dresses; the size 2 fit, not sure i could have zipped a size 0..loved that the boning at the front bust and sides keeps the dress up and in place without the straps. side pockets, and the cotton feels soft, more like a sateen than a poplin weave. lovely colo
4 I have only worn this 3 times with no signs of pilling, yet. it is good for cool spring days/evenings. for me, it'll be the cooler 3-seasons sweater. i wear a size large and it fits properly. i have worn lightweight long sleeve knit tees under this with ease in the sleeves. i think a slim sleeved shirt/blouse would work equally well. while i like the idea of the pockets, i think they'll stretch out easily beyond a tissue or quick hand warming. i removed 1 star due to the high price and i receive
4 Great purchase! i bought the coat to wear to work.
4 I got tons of compliments when i wore this top out a couple weeks ago. it is a little bit shorter than i thought, and a little bit loose (not "baggy" but just kind of hangs). if you have a larger chest, this may not be super-flattering. the color is really pretty and looked great with dark skinnies. i bought my normal size (after trying on a size down, which was just too short...and i'm 5'2)
4 I ordered this dress in the black motif and a petite size. the color is slightly more washed out than depicted probably because of the stretchy fabric used, but it is still nice. the dress does run large. the length is a bit too long and the pockets which i was surprised were even there are several inches too low for my 5'2" frame. overall though, this will be a good dress for hot summer days and should travel well. i wish the blue, floral one was available when i ordered this dress as it looks
4 I loved this dress the moment i saw it, pre-ordered it, but when it arrived the fit was off. i am almost always a size 4p in retailer clothing, this fit wonderfully everywhere, except the shoulders and chest were very small. i am 5'2" and 120 lb with a small bosom. (a cup) the shoulders were too tight and the chest gaped and sadly i had to return this dress.i may try to find it in the store to try on multiple sizes for the right fit.
4 I gave this four stars only because the lining has some polyester (poly/rayon blend) in it and i don't like polyester; still, i couldn't pass it up due to the chic look and the oh so warm feel of the coat. it's like wrapping yourself in a warm blanket and the wine color looks amazing! it's a little on the pricey side. since i consider it more of a sweater than a coat, i would have liked the price better if it was $100 less. it was one of those items that was hard to take off once i put it on. i
4 I ordered this in two sizes and have only received one so far, but i think i really like it. that said, the one i got weirdly has pockets not shown in the images, which makes it seems more professorial than i'd prefer, partly because i am a professor and don't want to dress like one if i can help it. that said, i really need a floppy, easy cardigan, and this might well be it.
4 Pants fit great. true to size. did not stretch like some of the retailer pants that you need to buy in a smaller size. love that the calf is bigger than most of their pants which are usually too narrow for my bigger calves. very comfy look great with a white shirt and tie die is subtle. they will be a staple summer pair of pants.
1 Unfortunately, does not look anything like in the picture. looks like an oversized house robe. i expected much more but was disappointed. i am definitely returning it.
4 Very well made and would flatter the right body type. i sized up to a medium (normally size 6), but the front part where the wrap came together did not cover me. the only thing you could see was the grey liner. i'm not sure this one was not sewn incorrectly, or it ran terribly small. i have had success with bailey 44 in the past so maybe this one was just not for me. the quality of the fabric and design are well done.
4 I love the idea of this top. it's made really well. the only issue is its a bit shorter than i thought and the neckline rubs on my neck.
4 I love this designer and decided to give this one a try. i ordered size large in black. it's a nice weight knit but not too heavy. good for fall and winter. the color is an intense,  saturated black that's really sharp looking. i thought it split up both sides, however, it's only split on one side and then angles across the back to the other side, which isn't split and is shorter.  i carry weight in my midsection, and this flows a bit away from the body but not in a giant oversized way. i like t
4 This top is very interesting, has delicate knitting pattern, feels very soft but also very thin. i ordered a purple size large, and it was true to size, but a little shorter in the body than looks, sleeves are long just as other reviewers have mentioned. i am 6ft tall, 160lb and i have long torso & curvy body, so this sweater turned out to be shorter than i hoped but with all that underneath layering it could be manageable. overall look of the sweater is about the same as the photo, the only mat
1 Thought this would be great for a laid-back wedding in new mexico, but didn't fit. i am a 12-14 and the 14 barely fit my chest and arms. not flattering. material did not seem very breakthable. had to return. better luck next time.
4 This dress is beautiful on so many levels. the colors and print are amazing and the maxi sweater dress idea is unique. it fits true to size and is very flattering. my only issue is the amount of shine that it has from the metallic threads running through it. i would have preferred less shine which would make the dress more versatile.
4 Just not the right color for my skin tone (though lovely pink). i didn't see the green in person, but probably nice too.the cut is well fitted at the waist, elastic band. i will say, however, that it was almost hard to pull the shoulders over (doesn't unbutton past waist). fabric is soft and flowey, length on the regular was mid-though for me, i am a tad oder, so it was nice... if i were younger, i would get petite.for reference: 115 lbs, 30 dd, 26.5 inch waist
1 I ordered these twice just to be sure there wasn't a glitch. the color is so off! the picture shows a dark blue denim, but they are not they are a light blue - with whiskering! retailer you need to have a better image of the color because this is so misleading.
4 But runs large. i tried on the regular 0 in the store and it was very pretty but baggy. would definitely need a tank if i were to wear this to work. lace is romantic and i do like the button details. i would give it a try but for me i will take my chance and wait for sale if it makes it there in my sie. i need 00. petite already gone sadly. reference 115 lbs 30dd and 26.5 on waist.
4 This poncho is very pretty and unique.it does run very over-sized, however that's how it is styled to be. the embroidery is very nice, it does sit back on the should a little further than pictured. the open weave is a little looser than the picture seems and you will need to wear something under it (cami; tank; body shaper). probably will pick or snag pretty easily also. the longer hem in the back is cute, but if you are on the shorter side you may not like where it hits. it will look best with
4 I'm glad they put up some pix of non-models looking cute in this dress, as it's taken a beating in the reviews! i measure 34(a)-27-35 and have no problems with the size s fit at all. it's drapey but not voluminous, with no pulling at the hips. the "folded" detail up at the top does call attention to the shoulders, but not in a bad way. the pleated neckline is cute on a small chest, and the red pattern/palette is awesome. love the length too -- i am 5'4" & the size s hits me just above the knee.
4 Cute top for jeans or capri pants. love the sleeve length.
4 I'm on the fence about this dress but overall i like it. the material, design and all is great! it's a light seersucker type fabric and short sleeves are perfect for summer. now the bad thing about this dress is partly the print combined with the swing/large cut. if you aren't too careful it can look like a housedress or hospital gown. i find i definitely need a belt to define my waist to avoid this.
4 I agree, this dress runs long, but since i love high heels, it falls just right for me. it does seem quite roomy for a medium, which is a pleasant surprise. the fabric, drape and quality are contemporary but i know i'll be wearing this beyond this year for sure.
4 I bought this top in hopes of getting a lot of wears out of it as we transition from summer to fall. the color is a pretty rust color perfect for fall, but also great for late summer. i love the leaf print, and the dark buttons on the sides really take the top to the next level. i love wearing this top with my high-waisted flare jeans, i get tons of compliments when i wear this top! it is definitely sheer, which i like, so i wish that it came with its own detachable camisole (the reason i took a
4 Really love this jacket! i agree with the previous review that while the x small fits great when i am standing--it is a little hard to raise my arms in it. however- it is great to wear over a dress or with jeans at the office. great quality- lined with jersey. i've gotten many compliments! (5'8, 120 lbs, xsmall)
4 I have 7 pair of pilcro denim shorts from retailer and for some reason the colored ones (white, yellow, pink) hold their shape but the denim blue completely stretch out. i went down a size in these and they still stretch to the point of sagging. i really want the black ones...hoping they don't do it too.
4 I was able to try this on in store thanks to a return. it is a cool looking item and i thought the fit and aesthetic were spot on but the price made me leave it behind. even on sale, i this wasn't worth the price for me- the high-low hem and material combined exclude it as a work option for me. if this is something you can get mileage out of, i really do recommend it- well made, lovely colors, and nice style.
4 When i first saw this top online, i thought it is very common beach like cover up, give or take. the main point of attraction for me was the cobalt blue silk trim. very vibrant looking color and very attractive. cough my eye for sure. however, when it arrived i was really surprised, how the top turned out to be. 1. much larger than expected, very roomy. 2. cobalt blue turned out to be not so bright, in fact, not even that interesting as it stands out in the photo. not too bad, but unexpected, i
4 This dress has great details and fit well on my hourglass shape. it just felt too covered up at the arms/shoulders, though. if the sleeves had been shorter or it had been sleeveless i think it would have felt a little more modern. the waistband on the one i tried on was also twisted, so you might want to check that before you buy. fit is tts. a little on the short side.
4 I do recommend this dress with some caveats. 1: it'll be difficult to find a bra that won't show straps, and 2: it's very figure flattering so if you're body conscious, particularly tummy
4 I just received this dress yesterday, so to be fair, i have not worn it out in public yet. i am deciding whether or not to keep it. i typically love west coast dolan dresses and this one is no different in looks. it's adorable and would be a great addition to your fall wardrobe. my only concern is the back. the back looks like a wrap dress that's backward - just the bottom half (that probably makes no sense). my worry is that the slightest bit of wind could catch it and the whole thing could ope
4 I love birds
4 I followed the advice of the other reviewer and went 2 sizes up, i'm so glad that i did. i'm usually an 8 and i ordered a 12 and they are just right. the pleats made them very flowy in the hip, so it gives a little wider look on me than i really want, but i really love these shorts, so it's not a deal breaker. overall, i am happy with them, but definitely size up!
4 Purchased on sale and worth the $20 or so dollars. just a good basic top. scoop neck not too deep, fabric is opaque enough to not need a cami.
4 This is a fairly high quality tank which i purchased in blue-green. it's narrower at the top, more voluminous at the bottom and a heavier knit than i expected, so i'm a little concerned about stretching over time, but i'll be careful washing it and enjoy it till that day does (or doesn't) come.
4 The quality of this top is wonderful. thick enough to prevent see-through, but thin enough to create a beautiful drape. the fringe details are lovely. the top is slightly roomy (ranks between "true to size" and "runs large," i.e., leaves room in the back when i clasp my hands together and stretch them out in front of me), but not really enough to size up. i'm 5'-4", 120 lbs., athletic build, and the small fits well. my only issue with the aesthetic is that the pattern of the lace on the upper pa
4 But if that works for you it is a cute pattern. this is a lighter weight sweater but good for fall.
4 This dress is adorable. it's easy to wear, really comfortable and i think looks great on. i'm 5'4", i probably should have gotten a petite - the shortest part of the dress meets my knees. the fabric is quite soft, flows like jersey - it does seem to be a little cheaper and i can't speak to durability yet...hoping it holds up!
1 Loved the look of this sweater online. was disappointed when i took it out of the package i was surprised at how stiff and itchy it was. i ordered my usual medium and though at first they shipped the wrong size it was small all over.  it felt cheep definelty not worth the high price. knew it was definitely going back
4 I generally like this style of pants- and these are particularly interesting, flattering and perfect for the season. love them.the style can be bohemian and chic or more conservative. the color is also a dark navy, and there is black leather piping on the 'pockets' making them a neutral- navy or black. i've worn with a long sleeveless hi-low hemmed button down top and neutral (saddle) heels for work with a cream jacket- and with a t'shirt and flats for the weekend. they have a bit of str
4 Love the texture and color of this tunic. it does seem to run large - i could have probably sized down to a pl without an issue. i do agree with other reviewers that the pockets are strangely placed and add bulk. i'm going to have them removed. overall, i really like it and have already worn it multiple times.
1 3 tags sewn in, 2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however, this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!
4 A bit wide in the torso, but the detail at the bottom of shirt makes up for it.
4 Bought this in an xs and i liked the style of the skirt. it was long enough to wear to work. however the waist was too large and would not stay up on my waist. returned.
4 This dress is beautiful and would make an excellent party dress for winter. it is well made and the details are pretty. however the waist is cut in sort of a scallop shape, so it is higher on the sizes and dips down in the middle over the stomach. i wear a size l or 10 in dresses at retailer, and it just did not flatter my body type at all. for a thinner, narrow silhouette, i suppose it would look better, like it does on the model. i had to return it.
4 These leggings are very comfortable and cute. only reason they are not 5 stars is because the pattern is not quite as vibrant as i was expecting.
4 The pants were true to size in the waist but they were a touch long for my 5'5" 120 lbs frame (i got a size 0). they did stretch out a little during the day (i wore them about 10 hours), but not nearly as much as the other reviews led me to believe. however, they were a little loose on my legs when i first put them on, which i liked.
4 This is made of soft, sweatshirt material. it is one of those dresses that you can put on with sandals or birkinstocks and go out to breakfast or throw it on to go to the beach or wear after yoga. this is not a "dressy" dress. that said, i love it. i used to have a sweatshirt dress from another brand that i wore out and have been searching for the replacement. this color is a pale celadon, a tad bit more vibrant than the photo, which makes it more flattering than you may think. i wear a 4-6 and
4 This top is super cute and comfy! just wish they would have made more xl's - ran out fast! i am 5'10 and usually wear an 8-10 top in retailer, so i purchased a large in this top to get the length and look of the model in the picture. it was too short and didn't fall like the picture, i tried to exchange for the xl and it was already sold out! bummer! was looking forward to wearing this all summer! 4 stars for running out of a size so quickly! please make more!!
4 I was stoked to get this dress, and it is truly beautiful, but the fit is so awful. it was like being swallowed up by a bag. i ordered my usual size 6; i'm 5'7" 140 lbs, and a bra size 34dd, but the dress just fell on me like a sack. i was so disappointed!! had to return.
4 I got this dress in neutral motif. looks very cute and the size is perfect.
4 I agree with another reviewer. the neckline is just right, not too low cut and a normal bra should work fine. also it would be nice if this dress were lined. the top part has more than one layer so that's not an issue, but the skirt doesn't so i'll likely wear spanks. other than that, it's a great maxi and perfect for spring or summer (light weight)..
4 I don't know what it is about this top but i was so drawn to it when i saw it in the store. it's totally see through, that's the design and i think it's great. i wear a cami underneath but if you're more daring or you spend a lot of time by the beach, you can get away with a nude bra or bikini top. this definitely runs small. i'm 5'5" 120 and usually wear xs/s but felt most comfortable in a medium. the body isn't tight or anything, it's just on the shorter side, especially if you have a longer t
4 Beautiful dress, can be dressed up or down. runs just a bit large, but if i had sized down it would have been too tight in the bust (38d). i normally wear a medium and the medium was perfect in the chest. the color is absolutely gorgeous and i love the length - i don't like dresses that show my knees. my only complaint is that a dress that is this expensive even on sale should have better quality control. mine made it to me without a button at the the back. not a huge deal, but it won't be easy
4 I have worn this with skinny jeans and espadrilles untucked and with black linen shorts. i also wore tucked in with high waisted slim fit black pants,i got compliments on all the looks. i think it's a fun and cheerful, feminine summer top.i got mine on sale so i thought was a fair price for what it is. wouldn't have paid full retail.requires ironing.i am a size 4 and 5'3 and have a small.
4 It runs long for a 5'1" woman like me:) other than that beautiful dress for vacation
1 This shirt had an overpowering vinegar odor when i took it out of the packaging.the mint green color was appealing but the styling did not look good and the smell was too much.
4 Very nicely made with attention to detail. thick and comfy. hand washing recommended. that's the only negative.
4 Since several reviews said that this dress ran small online, i decided to go to my local retailer store to try this on in person. i am 5"6", 120 lbs. and normally a 0 or 2. the 2 worked perfectly. i loved the red version online but thought the green was better for me in person (the red is a tomato red and was more overpowering on my fair skin). the green also has light blue in the detail print so maybe good if you have blue eyes. no problems with the zippers on the ones i tried at the store.
1 Poor quality, material looks much thinner and cheaper than pictured.
4 Bought this sweater as soon as i saw it. the knit ribs and the length help slim your lines. it is flattering even on my heavier mid section. the material is airy but not see through (yay!) i love that the deep v-neck with collar is not too deep for the office. i would buy another if another color becomes available. perfect spring to summer sweater
4 The fit and design are interesting. in the 00p, the fit was good though the dress was not easy to get into or out of - strategy required. the quality is fine. but the color was very "blah," with too little of the bright stripes in an otherwise rather dull color scheme. that made the dress overall feel too busy and rather confused. with the lining and material weight, it would be more a cold weather item only, not an all seasonal dress.generally, it was interesting but not a "most come home wit
1 This dress looks nothing like the photo. the sequins are dull, no sheen at all. the faux leather panels and straps look and feel like cheap, shiny plastic. i didn't even try it on, because it was so hideous, when i pulled it out of the box. not remotely worth the price and wouldn't buy it on sale for $20 either. skip.
4 I love the dress enough to go on a diet. i sized up but still have reservations about the integrity of the seams if i should sit at any point during its wear. i hate skin tight clothing, and wear a 0 in everything else - the 2 made me feel as if you could see my cervix. i own other byron lars dresses that fit in a 0 - something happened with this dress.
4 I ordered this in size xl. the fit is true to size. it fits me as it does on the model. the draping is very flattering. i'm a pear-shape and this shape works well. it definitely needs a tank underneath. you could sew a bit of the top to keep it closed. otherwise, everything can show. i like using different colored tanks to pull out the colors in the pattern.the quality of the material is outstanding. the print looks so much prettier in person. it's very vibrant. the photos online, at least on
4 This top is really cute. the fabric is soft with a little stretch to it. the lace shoulders with the denim cutouts add so much to this top. i was afraid it might make it too stiff & bulky around the shoulders, but it doesn't. very cute. the armholes are cut on the bigger side, but not so big that it shows your bra strap or anything.(just comfortable) the cut is also very nice and the pleats make it more body slimming. runs pretty tts. i ordered my usual medium and it's not quite as form fitting
4 This skirt is lovely and fits perfectly. the print on the front provides a great contrast to the back of the skirt and stands out. the material is thick enough to take you from fall to winter easily. and the fabric is structured enough to highlight all the right curves. a great purchase.
4 The fit of the dress is fabulous! it is so flattering and true to size. my only complaint is that he lining can be seen at the neckline. it might just be that the one i received is slightly defective. even with this problem, it is a keeper.
4 I have been wanting this skirt since it came out, and was overjoyed when it went on sale. i got my typical 00 size (24-26 waist, xsmall-xxsmall shirts/dresses), but when i tried it on i was a bit confused. the waist is a little roomy,so there's no way i could wear a 0, but the skirt hugs my butt. and i'm talking in that weird "hug the butt but flares out awkwardly below way". now i don't consider myself particularly gifted in the back end department, but this skirt sure says the opposite! i can'
4 I ordered this in xs and it fits loosely (i am 5'3" and about 120 lbs). this looks great with skinny jeans or leggings and shows off the long necklaces that are in style right now. the chiffon doesn't lie perfectly along the side seam, but i'm sure only i notice.
4 I ordered this dress in a 12 which is my usual size and it was tight around the waist and across the back. i am 5'7 170lbs, small chest but broader shoulders and back and curvy butt. this dress is beautiful quality and well made but was too snug. it was very long, to the point where i would only be able to wear heels. the belt is cheap looking, i would recommend replacing it with something nicer. the waist drops slightly below the natural waist and the top puckers over it in the front and back.
4 The first reviewer said it was small in the bust, but the 0p i ordered fit everywhere, rib cage and all, but was gaping at the bust (in the back). i would say overall it was true to size but if i sized down, it would be too snug in the rib cage. i am 30dd for reference there and waist is 26.5 inches,otherwise, the make is very pretty, i like the texture in the fabric, the color is very pretty as well. embroidery seemed high quality, but i decided to pass on it, even on sale, since it didn't
4 This dress is perfect for any occasion, it looks great with every shoe and is flattering on.
4 Man do i love this dress! love the fit and the quality of the fabric, lays really nicely. i gave it only four stars because it is super short. true i am 5'11" but there is no way i could wear this without pants or leggings. i am super bummed because i really love it but must send it back.
4 Fell in love with this the moment it arrived in stores. whimsical but work--appropriate. i'm typically a 4 in dresses. i would say this skirt runs tts; however, the front pleats will create a pouch-y stomach if you have a small waist and a lucious anything-below-your-waist. size up one size to avoid this. the waist size will be loose, but it will allow the pleats to lay flat. absolutely lovely with a mock neck sleeveless top. also great with solid white, black, or printed blouses. not a true pen
4 I love this coat but it does not work for my body type. it is a beautiful coat and of very good quality. it has a wonderful lining which is so nice to see as many of the "coats" retailer is carrying right now are not lined. the coat is soft and feels so good. it seems to run true to size. i would have purchased this if the button placement were higher up. the button closure is right at my hips ( i am 5'6" for reference) and i am pretty curvy. when open, the coat looked great but when i trie
4 I got this in the red and the black.i returned the red,for it doesn't compare to the black one.i would have loved it,if it was a red dress with white flowers.i didn't like it being a white dress with red flowers.the black one is the one to pick!
4 I loved the fabric and this print but it was just cut a little wrong for me. the gathering on the side made me look a bit wide. but the fabric is beautiful and everything else was nice. i did like the fact that it ties in the back so you can slim down the sillouhette (sp?) if you want to.
4 Got this dress on sale. it fits great. i am 5'8", small bust, small waist but bigger hips. and this dress makes all those areas look great.
4 Ordered this cover up in a mp but it was waaay too big so now waiting for the sp to arrive! hope its a hit!
4 Great quality, i didn't expect the neck to be so wide but it still looks nice.
4 This dress is really pretty, but the fit is off. it is not fitted at the waist which made the back look poofy. also, the arm length is not flattering; it needs to be either longer or shorter. additionally, if one was to wear it a lot, the felting might start to fray.
4 Soft and pretty, but way too big and wide. love the bell-sleeve detail. i'm exchanging for one size smaller.
4 I am between a xs and s but figured i would order down based on the reviews. well, it's still huge. i have about 5 inches that i can take in from the side. i have ordered the xxs and am hoping it will look more flattering. i love the colors and design, but as it is it does not do anything for me. for reference i am 124 lbs, 32d, 5'5".
4 I have literally dozens of deletta tops. just four things to know: very unique/attractive, run large/stretch out (size down), poor quality fabric, and usually low cut.
4 This dress is really stunning - can be dressed up or down with a jean jacket really easily. runs quite a bit small in the bust (i ordered a 16 to accommodate) but it is really very pretty. i love this brand- they always have such lovely pieces.
4 Beautiful top, but delicate! i wore it to school and the straps on my backpack caused some pilling. other than that it is beautiful and vibrant! just make sure you aren't doing/wearing anything that will rub it continuously since the fabric is delicate
4 I just received this in the green color. it is a true medium jade green. my monitor shows a blue color and that is what i expected. the green is pretty but i would have preferred the blue that was shown. i found this to fit large . the pockets that are barely visible in any of the photos gape open and don't lie flat. i do like this sweater as a very casual jacket alternative on cooler days. the cashmere is a nice weight and is not too precious to wear every day with jeans.
4 These pants are really pretty and comfrotable, and i took a cahnce ordering them with a "31 inch inseam:, i thought perhaps they would work with a 4-inch heel...howeverm it is not the case, tey much be much longer than 31 inches. due to the cut out i will not be able to have htem hemmed, so htey must go back. if you are taller, i recommend, they are truly flattering.
4 This sweater carries alot of weight, more than it appeared. the yellow is more of a bright green/yellow- not a soft color as pictured. it is still a nice layering piece.
4 I love the look of this bra, but unfortunately it is pretty skimpy and sheer. i need a little more padding to define my shape and i wish it had modesty padding. this wasn't for me so i returned it.
4 I purchased this top in the xs and was so excited to receive it as i love the layered look snd the back of the sweater was so cute online! the sweater itself is lovely, but it was a tent on me! waaaaay too big for my 5'3" frame. if you're a taller gal or someone who likes more volume in their swing tops, this is for you. unfortunately, i had to return it.
4 I'm a 32ddd and this top fit perfect. i wore it with boyfriend jeans and flats. the material is nice and perfect for fall
4 A wonderfully heavy weight piece, opposed to all the swingy chambray of summer, this piece will transition wonderfully into fall. the only disadvantage is a relatively high neck, which looks lovely but can be a little restrictive at times. highly recommend!
4 I bough the blue color and love it. the neckline detail is fun and make you take a double take when looking at what is otherwise a relatively simple top. it drapes nicely, and paired nicely with dark skinny jeans and ballet flats for work (i'm at a tech company, so casual to business casual). the ombre color is gorgeous! (the lavender is pretty too but seemed to wash me out and not fall as nicely).regarding what other reviewers said: yes, it has a slightly vinegar smell when it came shipped, b
4 I love denim and this tunic/dress/shirt is soft and fits really well except its almost too long to be a tunic/shirt but too short to be a dress - at least for me but i have a long torso - still not sure if i should keep it.
4 This is a comfortable skirt that can span seasons easily. while not the most exciting design, it is a good work skirt that can be paired with many tops.
4 It's not them it's me. so sad. ordered two sizes 25 r and 24 p. nothing about them worked for me. i loved the colors (blue and green). i loved" the fabric (heavy washed soft cotton). i loved the style. ah but there is the rub. i am so small that the width of the legs just swallowed me up. whereas the 24s fit around the waist and the length, while longer than i'd have liked was doable, there was just so much fabric around my skinny legs i felt as though i was wearing huge balloons on each leg. (t
4 I want to love this top - it is so pretty, but i find the fit very odd. i think it runs big, but the arm holes seem to be cut really low. i would love to size down, but then i think the sleeves would be off. unfortunately, i will have to return it.
4 This is a beautiful blouse that runs one to two sizes too small. i usually wear an 8, maybe a 10 on a bad day. i couldn't get into the 8, the 10 was uncomfortably tight, and even the 12 was snug (i haven't worn a size 12 anything since i was pregnant years ago). i think this blouse would look best on a woman without any curves as it adds curves to any woman's body. since i already have curves, i felt like jessica rabbit in this blouse. it was too much for me. again, lovely blouse, but i would no
4 I'm not entirely sure if this shirt just runs large or if it fits oddly/boxy. the flowered material puffs out on the sides a couple of inches under my arms... i'm usually a pretty solid size medium, but i think i'm going to try to exchange this for a small to see if that solves that weird fit issue, because it is a nice idea of a design and comfortable overall. but, if that doesn't solve the trick, if not recommend, b/c that side puffiness isn't flattering.
4 I also sized down, and i'm glad that i did. i had been watching this top for awhile and was glad to get it on sale. it is not thick- more of a top than a sweater.
4 This may be one of my favorite purchases from retailer in a long time. i really appreciate the unique design, a quality that has drawn me to retailer for years. the cute little quirky owls are as rich in color as they are in personality. i'm don't typically favor cheaper polyester blends though the texture feels fine on my skin. this top definitely runs small and i had to size up to get the fit and length i desired. overall, i am very pleased and have received lots of compliments after wearin
4 I decided to order this skirt to look at it and regret it now as i want to keep it. one bummer is the smallest size (xs) runs big, the skirt falls on my lower waist aka hips on me, not on my waist. bu i love the look, it has pockets where the pattern reverts the fabric is soft and thick, making the skirt structured. the length was nice on me, though ti is a mini and there is no petite size, the hem still was above my knee, and therefore was acceptably flattering. the colors are also nice for fal
4 I love the look of this shirt. it is super soft and has a great draping quality. i personally love that the mid-stomach seem is see through, but if you didn't like that, you could easily wear a tank under it. overall good buy!
4 Debated for a while about this dress...love the flower embroidery but i was worried the nude colored top would look drab on. it actually looks nice on my skin (tan-ish, yellow toned), surprisingly. however, there is a noticeable amount of extra room in the waist (i have a 24'' waist. it wrinkles a bit in that area when i move around. i'm not sure if that's a deal breaker or not...i guess now i have even more to debate about. the length is a tiny bit longer on me than on the model #5'0'', 100 lbs
4 I think it's prettier in person. the color is a little brighter in reality, and the beading on the lower half is in 2 colors (green and gray), which isn't apparent in the photo. although i would consider it true to size, it's a full looking top. i'm 5'8', and both the sleeves and the length are not as long on me as they are on the model. it's a bit sheer, but i personally found it to be fine with a nude bra. cute vintage look.
4 As previous reviews have stated, this blouse is see through but it is amazing!!! very rich quality and can be dressed up or dressed down. it is well worth the price now that it is on sale!
4 Even though i'm currently at a 34f in the bust the size 12 works for me, although i did install 2 snaps between the top 3 buttons to keep everything in line. i'm 5'5" and my torso is often too short for regular sized clothes. the straps were too long for me, but to my delight i discovered that this particular dress is designed to unstitch and tailor the strap length with ease. with those small alterations this dress fits like it was made for me, plus the pattern and fabric are top notch. i tried
4 Nice quality. too big for my taste. really liked the style but sleeves were very long.
1 I am sorry to say this blouse is way below all retailer standards. this top should have been placed on sale a long time ago! poor quality in cut, fabric, design. this is a top one would grab at a local box store for 19.99. the colors are not as vibrant. the shoulders ill fitted. and the fabric and threads are very cheap. i was expecting so much more.sorry retailer.....my favorite store to shop!
4 I just received this dress in the blue and its very small in the ribcage/bust area. i'm 120 lbs, 5'1, 34d bust and i'm always a 2-4 regular or a 4-6 petite in this brand. i couldn't even zip up the 4 regular all the way. i will probably reorder it in a 6 and an 8. great material, beautiful color, great style.
1 The fabric of this vest is identical to a old white dish cloth! the cut of this vest is also bad! will be sent back!
4 I wear a 25/26 jean and the size s in this bikini bottom was just too small. in photos it looks so cute, but on me it just didn't look like anything special. hopefully the larger size has more pizzazz.
4 Yes! i love the color, the fabric and the fit up top. the skirt, however, is very poofy. i am going to let it hang for awhile (it was an online order) and see if some of that relaxes. otherwise, i will need to return it.
4 I ordered this shirt in each color and different sizes: petite, regular, "my" size, a size up and one down!verdict: i ended up in regular size, not petite because i felt the petite was jsut that short and i could feel te cold breeze in the store. i could have gone in the 00, 0, and 2 #2 is my usual size#, but ended up in a 0 only because it was less wide on me. it is, hwoevcer a tiny bit tighter around the back if i cross my arms forward #really, i don't do that move on a daily basis#. colr: i
4 This is a modern version of the peplum top and very flattering if you don't mind flowy cuts. the material has a nice heaviness to it, and i love the black pebbled effect. 34 d, 130 lbs fit small perfectly.
4 I found this dress to be perfect for the winter season. its warm, sleek, and classy. this dress is made in the usa so it is worth the price. i love the opening on the back and find it be flattering. it can be worn with tights for the winter and easily worn without in the summer. a wise investment for my closet!
4 These shorts are very well made and the embroidery work is beautiful. the dark yellow is a little bit more orangy looking than in the pictures, but is still a pretty color. don't expect any give or stretch with these shorts.
4 The design of this top is super cute and the material is decent. the only flaw is that despite buying the smallest size (xxsp), it's still very boxy on me. i wish it was more fitted at the waist which would make it much more flattering. however, since i am actually pregnant, this actually works to my advantage, for the time being.
4 I ordered both colors in different sizes (xs and xxs) - petite were no longer available, so can't compare there.color: i liked the black better for these reasons:1) color can be worn year-round, just add a nice jacket or cardigan, and ok for winter season.2) ivory was kind of see-throughsize: xxs fit me better, the xs was wider and bigger arm holes.sadly, the xxs was the ivory, so i didn't keep either of them.ref: 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in wasit
4 This jumper is adorable and very well made! it is a bit tight in the ankles and it kind of gives me a hungry bum look but then i realized i ordered a 4p so it is actually tts. going to preview this number at my bachelorette party!
4 Really pretty, but runs at least a full size small.
4 This is definitely one that looks better on than on the hanger. i am 5'10" so it is a little too short for me to wear with bare legs (it tends to ride up) but it looks great with boots and tights. i love the raw edges of the striped a-line part. i have also worn it belted and that is also a very cute look.
4 I love pilcro jeans and usually wear the stet fit. this is the first pair that i've owned that had so much stretch. they stretch and do lose their shape slightly, but bounce back after a wash. my main complaint may be stretch-related: after the first wear, the inner thigh area was covered in pills. granted, my inner thighs touch when i walk, but this has never happened with any other pair of pilcro that i've owned. i still have a pair of black stet that i bought 4yrs ago and they've never shown
4 Size down, runs a bit large, sleeves are cute and overall a pretty piece
4 This dress is really really soft and comfortable. it's loose but still flattering. i would definitely recommend it.
4 I am not a big fan of lace but this shirt has just enough. it actually looks better than the photo and it looks even better when you wear it. i have received numerous compliments on this shirt everytime i've worn it.
4 I saw this online and loved it instantly. i happened to come by it in the store and tried it on. it was almost perfect. but sadly, being busty makes the dress hang not quite as well as it could. i think this might be a better dress for the less busty/less curvy. but it is super cute and fun!
4 Literally the only reason i am giving this 4 stars is because of my history with this brand (holes developing after minimal wear). i will do my usual wash but don't dry and hope it holds up!material: super soft and comfortable, almost slubby. i haven't seen the yellow in person, the purple/grey is lovely. fit: moderate scoop neck as pictured (almost oval) that's a nice touch as it's not too low or high at the neck. not overly fitted over the chest or stomach - without being oversized - j
4 This dress is shorter than it looks on the model. i'm 5'8" and it hits about 1 inch above my knee. it also runs a little big in my opinion.
4 This dress is perfect for the summer, very lightweight, has pockets and not to short lounging around. it is loose fitting, so i normally wear a size 10 or m and 5'6" tall, but had to order this dress in a s. the small fits me perfectly.
1 I love the idea of this shirt, but the execution is absolutely horrible. i ordered online and what i received is just a mess. the stitching at the bottom has big globs of black thread. not just a few hanging off, but literally big clumps. a large portion of the stitching on the whole shirt looks like it should be on the underside of the shirt as the where the thread is tied off is on the outside!! the fit is just as big a mess. i always have to buy a large in fitted shirts because i have very br
1 This shirt was great for one wear. after just one wash (followed instructions to dry clean) it lost all shape and now hangs like a bed sheet. terrible waste of money on a pricey top.
4 Like another reviewer, i really wanted to love this dress. everything about this screamed perfection: the length, the cut, the stripes, but the fit was really off for me. i'm 5"10" and am usually between a size 8 and 10. i tried the 8 and the body fit well but the chest and straps were entirely too large (i'm a 34d). so i tried the size 6 and chest and straps fit but the body pulled at the buttons. normally, i'm all for tailoring to fit, but chest would have needed to be reconstructed which isn'
4 Super cute! got a marilyn vibe that i like. although i can tie the halter to make the chest area tighter, i will have to get a tailor to adjust the chest area and under the arms a bit.
4 I really wanted to love this coat. it is well made and unique. i usually buy the petite versions but they were sold out.however i went ahead and purchased a regular size because i wanted a second winter coat.sadly, it looked more like a cocoon coat on me. it stuck out at the back. probably because it was not a petite. it pulled across my chest, like shoulders were too short. for reference, i am 5 feet, 109lbs, and a 32d.i didn't mind the fluffiness of the top portion and the tie is useful for
4 This shirt is so soft and lovely, i will be wearing it a lot...after i make one little adjustment. i don't mind some cleavage, but the bottom of the slit in the middle of this shirt goes all the way down to my bra and i feel like i'm showing a lot of side boob...inner side boob?...cleavage? i don't know what the word is, but it definitely feels out of place in a professional setting. however, i'm going to sew a hook and eye onto the top of the slit so i can close it and it will be more like a ke
4 This dress is comfortable and a great piece to travel with. goes with ballet flats, sandals, to ankle boots.
4 This top is cute. i got the mint coloured one and like it. with that said, the sewing however is a bit off. the bottom of the top is angled. there is no mention of that in the description so it is safe to say it is not part of the design. it is not tremendously noticeable,  but i noticed it. i will still keep this top, coz i can camouflage that defect with a cardigan.  it is sheer, so if you are wearing it for work without cover, a camisole would be required or a nude bra. i am 5'0", 109lbs, and
4 Excellent tunic tee. will be great with leggings or jeans, which is just what i was hoping.
4 I love mixed media clothing, and this is no exception. i fell in love with this right away, and after being torn between the two colors, opted for the rose. it's very gorgeous in person - midweight and very soft. however, as soon as i put it on, i noticed the knit sides truly flare out; they don't lay nicely like on the model. it could be because of my large chest (36dddd), but everything below the chest seems to widen me. it might work better on someone with a straighter build or smaller chest.
4 I ordered this piece online and returned it at the store a few days after arrival. the material is very soft and well made. however it is not flattering on the hourglass or pear shaped person. moreover, if you are short, the design may make you look shorter. i am 5'4" and it did to me. the design is beautiful. if you are tall and have narrow hips, this is the piece for you. i am 5'4", 160lbs and usually wear a s/m.
4 I understand the style of this dress is "swing", but there is just so much fabric, and it looked a bit like a tent on me. i ordered the s and i just found it to be too loose all over. the fabric is great and the colors are rich and lovely. this style would probably look better on someone smaller-chested, because there is no waist, it falls out from the bustline. cute dress, but i would size down.
1 I wanted to like this top so so so so badly. so badly in fact, that after the first size didn't fit, i ordered two other sizes to make sure: xl, l, m. none of them worked i really wanted to like this top. the online photo makes the clothing look so flattering and the shirt is just not....at least on me. the shirt online on the model looks slimming and a lot longer than the actual piece of the clothing. the beaded work is very beautiful, but short causing the very poofy peplum to start at the mos
4 I needed to size down to a small. it's very flowy. but the color palette and the open stitching around the neck and hem are really sophisticated and pretty.
4 The colors and fabric on this dress are really pretty. the lace is a soft blue instead of white. i have other dresses like this from this brand and really wanted to keep it, but it runs larger than the others i have. also, it doesn't have pockets. if it fits you properly, i think you will love it!
4 I followed the other reviewers who said these fit true to size. i have to disagree. i normally wear an 8 in shorts, which is what i ordered, and the fit is too tight in the waist and butt. i'm exchanging for 10. i really like the color and fun accents. i really hope i can get these in 10!
4 This is super cute. i bought it in the gray and white lace in a size s and it's quite roomy. i probably could have sized down to an xs, but i like the relaxed look. there are a few edges of lace that are not sewn down all the way and i will have to fix them as i can see them start to pull away and eventually unravel but otherwise it's a beautiful and unique top.
4 The design is stunning, the color is universally super-flattering. it's a lovely top. so much so that i tried it on even though it was pricey. but the armholes are huge. you can see it on the model, who is definitely not wearing a bra. on me, there was a lot of side bra exposure. if they'd had smaller sizes at the berkeley store, i would've given them a shot, but my true size was a really poor fit.
4 The style and material are nice, but what i love is that it does not give me a wedgie! and i think it would still fold nicely on shorter frames.
4 I need to start by saying i'm 5' 10". i think that's why i love this dress so much. it's not too short on me like so many. it is a classic fit that is flattering on me. the raw edge detail makes it a little more fun then just a strapless denim dress and the pockets are the best! i love dresses with pockets! they don't stick out weird or anything either. the only negative which prevents the perfect 5 star review is the bottom is fuller than i would like. a-line is a little misleading. it's defini
4 I ordered the petites hoping the length would fits ankle length but htey do go all the way down. on a muscular bottom/thighs, these a snug, on the model they look loose, but i still do like them. to wear with longer tops... i ordered 25p for 115lbs.
4 I love byron lars. very taken with his fabrics and design concepts and i have ordered several of his dresses but i believe i need to surrender to the fact that they do not work for my body type. the dress is gorgeous in person: all the fabrics are great, the dress is fully lined and lots of nice finishing touches. it is a unique and very striking dress; this one i really wanted. however, it is designed for a woman who is proportionally longer, leaner with a larger bust size than i have. i ordere
4 This dress is lovely and has a comfy fit. the green color is gorgeous. i felt the sizing was large and sent it back.
4 Nice basic shirt to wear with jeans. it is super soft and hangs nicely. runs true to size.
4 I loved this top. loved it. the quality and color ( i got the red) are wonderful. the top fit perfectly through the chest and the a-line design was super flattering through the waist. however, i am long waisted and the top was simply too short on me. even when worn with mid-rise trousers, my belly showed when i leaned to the side or reached my arms above my shoulders. i so hoped it would be perfect with skinny jeans or leggings - as shown on the model - but on a long-waisted frame it is simply t
4 This piece is almost what i want... i tried on the white version in an xs and it felt a little too large for me, even though it's meant to be a looser fit. the buttercup yellow behind the lace is very pretty - i especially love that part of this tank. it provides a nice contrast and allows the detail to stand out. the navy is also nice (it was on display next to the white and looks better in person than online). what i didn't like was the texture of the spandex on the back portion. it looks like
4 This was returned in store in an xs. i tried it on and it fit. shorter so it was probably meant to be a mini. i will hold on to it for now. on sale so worth the price. colors are nice and bright
4 I loved this top from first sight and finally bought it this week. i am usually a six or a small. the small was so tight on the top that the ruffle rolled up across my chest. i ended up with a medium.
4 I really like this sweater. i would suggest ordering a size up. i could had worn my normal size but a size up was much more comfortable. i have a burnt orange skirt that i wear with this and it makes the flowers pop.
4 Gorgeous piece, although much longer than it appears to be in the photo. the price, however, is a bit steep. i'm not sure that i'm going to keep it because i just don't think it looks as expensive as it is.
4 I ordered this dress in the black p8. i am 5' 3-1/2", 140lbs, 34dd. i am average length in the torso area.. when i tried it on i wasn't able to button the button at my chest and the belt came slightly above my natural waist line. the length of the dress hit above mid thigh. way to short for my comfort level. it almost looked like a babydoll dress or a tunic to wear over jeans! the material is good quality and has a nice slip lining underneath. another nice thing is that it has a hook and eye clo
4 I would describe the color as more blush. the fabric does not have a sheen as in the model picture. the fit is much cuter on than hanging. i'm a 36c and the extra small is just a bit tight in the bust, otherwise i like the fit everywhere else. i'm going to order a small and see how it fits. at 5' 3" it's also longer on me than on the model but not a deal breaker. looks kind of 1920's vintage on. my fabric is not see through it's more of a twill fabric but not quite as heavy as that.
4 I'm keeping this cute and fun dress but i agree that the top is tricky if you have a larger bust or shoulders. i got my tts 6 and am a 32dd with broad shoulders and can wear it but it's snug. the top would probably look better in an 8 but there's so much volume below, i kept the 6. i'm 5'7" and thought it was short but just fine for anything other than a professional setting. i have toddlers, so not the best dress for bending over, but fun for when i'm out and about on my own.big compliments
4 I would have loved this tee but the color didn't love me. it's sort of a mustard orange. the embroidery is beautifully done but i felt the size of the yarn tassels were too big and looked a bit odd, but i have a large bust so don't like to draw attention there. it's a sweatshirt and not a tee shirt, but it flows and doesn't grab anywhere. it looked so nice under a jean jacket. if it weren't for the color and tassels, it would be a keeper for me.
4 I bought both colors. the navy is beautiful but the grey is closer to a drab beige and the color really disappointed me, i'll be returning that one. i love love the fit and feel of the sweater. it drapes wonderfully whether open or closed and it's so soft. however, the fabric pilled significantly, big pills not even little ones, where my arms touch my sides after just four wears. !!! i get that rayon is finicky but that is ridiculous. the navy is now out of stock in my size so i guess i'll try t
4 Cute suit over all. cups are lightly padded, which is nice if you're concerned about modesty. it runs really small in my opinion. i am 5'7" and 125 lbs. i almost always wear a size small, but i ordered a medium in this suit, and although it fits and i'm sticking with the medium, i'm wondering if a large might fit even better. it's also too tight on the leg openings, in my opinion. i like that the straps are adjustable. the pattern is flattering, and i like the suit well enough to keep it. but i
4 I am 135 and went with a size zero. it was very cute on but a little tight on my hips when sitting. the fabric is beautiful, and very soft and silky. the length was great, comes to just barely above my knees and is long in the back. great work outfit.
1 Retailer has incredible service, and so they let me return this dress even after having worn it. however, this dress cannot be cleaned. i saw a stain on it after the first use, so i first tried hand washing it. however, the black part of the dress came off on the white part, making the stain worse. i then tried dry cleaning it (the care tag allows both) and that produced 3 or 4 new stains where the black rubbed off on the white. it's a beautiful, striking dress (that would be great maternit
4 As you can tell from the pictures, it's nothing fancy; i think this dress will get a lot of wear for everyday living. simple and comfy. reviewers said it ran pretty small so i sized up but wished i hadn't. it is not very "fit
1 Beware! there is a reason this sweater is on sale. it is not even remotely the same color as pictured. instead of the lovely antique blue in the photo, this sweater is a faded, boring, teal-green. what a huge disappointment.
4 This was way better than i expected it to be. tts and flattering. the material on the top section is on the thinner side, but is very soft and comfortable. the skirt section is a little on the shorter side for me, but with tights i think i could still make it wearable for work.
1 I should have paid closer attention to the other reviews. i could barely get this blouse over my head! after getting it on, the armholes too are very small. the blouse other than that is pretty and very girlie. i love the pleating and dolman sleeves but i was strangled around my neck. i tried the small but think a medium wouldn't have been much better. it needs a button opening on neck and sleeves. i would have to put this on before makeup or doing my hair. if you have a tiny head and pencil a
1 Wow this is huge! i'm all for the tent-look with the right style, but this was absurd. i could have fit two of me into the width, and with the peplum style, extra width doesn't flatter anyone. the fabric is also so thin that it doesn't hang nicely, it kind of floats around the body. if you want a wide top, then this is perfect, but if you wanted something that hangs nicely, look elsewhere. i purchased a petite s, my typical size.
4 I love this top. the design is very good, i love the pleats at the back, and i tried both colors. i prefer blue even though both look good. the fit is very loose mainly due to the pleats at the back. i usually wear xl but bought this in an l, which was also very loose. i think an m would be too tight across the shoulders but loose lower because of the pleats. i am keeping the blue because i like this style, with fitted pants it would work well.
4 I think i'll get a lot of wear out of this. you will be able to size down & it will still hide a host of sins. it's very comfortable and stylish.
4 Was so excited to order this beautiful shirt!  and the color sky is gorgeous!  but as another reviewer said--it runs small.  it was also way too short.  so sadly i will be returning this.  i gave it 5 stars because it is beautiful and great quality--it just didn't fit me.
4 This is one of those dresses that hides on the rack until you see it. and you think, hmmm- this is really interesting. and then you try it on. and all the ladies in the dressing room say "whoa" yep, this is that dress. much more fitted and flattering on my 5'9" 150lb frame. it oddly kind of alludes to 70's caftans. very cool.
4 This top is beautiful. the cutout portion extends below the bust, but is intricate enough to look good with a black bra or exciting with, say, a taupe or grey one. the fit across the shoulders is snug, but the rest of the top is very voluminous. don't expect to tuck this swamp thing in. it's a bit of an odd contrast, but if you're prepared to wear something that is itself a beautiful object, even if it doesn't really make sense for a human body... this is it.
4 I am a horse lover so i had to have it as it is of good quality and unique. be mindful that it runs small and fits alittle snug across shoulder also excellent for layering.
1 The fabric of this looks and feels so cheap it's hard to believe this is anna sui. i would say this is unwearable. there is zero stretch and it is made of itchy textured poly fabric that looks like novelty fabric at best. going back asap.
4 I tried these jeans on at the suggestion of the salesperson and couldn't walk out of the store without buying them even at full price of over $200 which i don't usually spend on jeans.. first of all, the material is so buttery soft you can't believe you are wearing jeans, secondly, i could actually find a pair that would fit my smaller waist in comparison to my larger than i wish hips 27-28 waist, 38-39ish hips... 5-4 i ended up with size 26... they are very thin and i worry about how they will
1 I was so excited to order this dress. i loved that it had a normal neck, nice length, and there wasn't a hole in the back. but this dress is just plain awful. the top fit tight across the bust, it flattened me out like i was wearing a too tight sports bra. then the back zipper puckered and bumped up like there is too much zipper for the fabric. i could not get the zipper to lay flat. the fabric is itchy and very cheap feeling. on top of it all the colors are much brighter than they appear in the
4 I love this shirt! it's a nice simple long-sleeved tee with some nice details. i especially love the seaming on the front & back-- very flattering!
4 I really wanted to love this dress. the pattern is so much prettier in person. i typically wear a medium, sometimes a large in tops. the medium in this dress was too tight in my chest; the large fit my chest but was ridiculously large in other areas. the front of the dress goes up pretty high (for someone with a large chest) and flows down. there is a tie in the back but it doesn't do much to help with the shape in the front.
4 I liked this shirt so much i ordered a second one online in the same size but different color. unfortunately the second one is much shorter than the first and looks less like a tunic or more like a cropped flowy top - not a good look. so the second one is going back. otherwise the shirt would get 5 stars. washes well, super soft and comfy, and looks great with all kinds of bottoms...jeans, cords, leggings. wish it came in more colors. i typically wear a m or l in retailer tops and took the l in th
1 Bought the dress online and it only has an eye and hook at the top. the waist has no stretch and their isn't a zipper. you have to be a contortionist to get it over your head and shoulders. so cute in the pic but not realistic. going back.
4 This blouse is very cute and will be great for summer casual wear! so cute in this print - it looks great with colored crop pants!it is a bit tough to get the right fit in this top, depending on your preference. i usually wear a size 2-4 in tops (26" waist, 34b/c), but went with a 0 in this because it just felt wide otherwise. also, i am fine with it, but this blouse seems to be somewhat short in the torso. if you are particular, possibly buy in store because the pattern of bees varies quite
4 This dress is gorgeous, flattering, oood quality and, in my opinion, better than the erin fetherston dress because of the black, rather than nude liner, which really brought our the beautiful embroidery. come on, practically everything in rtw is a knockoff of something. i do have to comment that the slip is quite snug, though, but at least it's stretchy. that being said, it still had a bit of a tendency to creep up. i was glad i had a black half slip on as well. the fit is tts but a bit short wa
4 I loved wearing this outside on a hot day! the fabric is a nice quality. you can't tell in the photos, but it is a jersey/knit fabric. the color labeled red that looks orange is actually coral. it's a nice color. i usually wear a true size 2, and that's what i ordered, but i found that it is slightly big. i can wear it, but would have preferred half a size to a full size smaller. a versatile dress that you can wear often!
4 Sized up due to my 36ddd breastfeeding bust and the 14 for perfectly.  i am 5'6 and 165lbs, just fyi.  dress is super flattering on my post 4-baby body.  it's very slimming.  looking forward to wearing to a casual wedding,
4 This tee is cute and unusual and i am sure i will wear it pretty often. i do wish i had ordered a size smaller than my normal large, but i am waiting for it to shrink in the wash a bit. the material is thin and it certainly doesn't feel like it is worth the price tag. i got it on sale and still think it is only worth about 20$.
4 Once i saw this trench coat i thought it was so cute! i'm usually a small in retailer tops but can be a little broad so i decided to go with the medium (based on other reviews). when i received the coat, it was a little tight in the shoulders but still doable. i was surprised how thin it was (just a single sheet of cloth) and how full the skirt bottom was (however, there is a cute light blue seem lining inside). overall this trench coat is not really a warm coat, but more of a fun piece to dress u
4 I ordered this top online. i had been wanting an off-the-shoulder top in a neutral color and when i found this one, i had to have it! i thought the price was great. when i received it, i was impressed with the quality of material. it fit me a little more tightly than some of my other tops, but was very satisfied with how it looked on my body! i got it in a size small. i do agree with others on here, the shoulders were a little more difficult to keep folded down...but overall...i am truly satisfi
4 I love this dress for day and night time. the back detail is cute and works well with a racerback bra. it runs big though. i'm normally a small in dresses and the arm holes are too big in the size small on me. it was also generally too big all over. i like the length and the weight of the fabric. i purchased in the off black color.
1 I tried on this jumpsuit in black and it was absolutely beautiful. i liked that it looked sort of like a tuxedo, i wore it one time and received so many compliments. when i washed it, however, it shrunk almost 1 size! the pant legs were high water. i even tried washing and restretching it because i loved the jumpsuit but it wouldn't budge, i think because rayon is not stretchable material. to my disappointment, i returned it. i really wished it would have worked out.
4 When i saw this dress online, i immediately passed on it. but i was drawn to it's faint shimmer and soft feel in the store and decided to try it on. i am usually xs - s in dresses and tried the xs (5'4, 34b, 27 waist). it fit beautifully. it comes about a couple of inches above my knee and makes me look slim from the side - which isn't typical of shift dresses. i plan on wearing it with flats now and tights and booties when the weather gets cooler. would be a great holiday or new years eve dress
4 Was looking for a layering tunic and this does the job. it's very long and i'm 5'11 and this covers to my mid thigh. the arms are very tight but stretched after a while and the material is thin. i like the button details and the olive color are a nice break from black and white. white might be see-through.
4 Gorgeous, soft (yak hair, whaa?), versatile sweater. lean fit, not bulky. runs maybe a little large. i'm generally between a s/m in tops, so i ordered both. the s fit really well. the m did too, but a bit bulkier and wide in the hips. i'm 5'8", 140 lbs, 34c. i'll wear this with everything, mostly with leggings or tight jeans with boots.
4 I love the overall look and comfort of this piece. my only negative is that since it is not lined, the folds in the material on the inside are somewhat noticeable, especially in the shoulder areas. i guess since it is a light color it is more obvious to me, but it is not something that would make me return it. it is comfortable and looks great on.
1 This skirt is gianormous! i usually take an xl or l, so i ordered both. the waistband on the xl was so huge, i didn't even try it on. i feared it would not stay up! so i tried the large, and it was big as well. i think i would have needed a medium. but as it is, it is not the cute a-line that appears in the picture. (i wonder how they even got it to look like that !?!?!) it is huge, hip-y, and bunchy. yuck.
4 The fabric is quite thin and sheer. it runs a little small also. that being said they are really beautiful pants especially on sale
1 I so wanted this skirt to work, love the design! but, it's way, way too long... i am 5, 5, 116lb, and the small is 1 inch on the floor. i step on the skirt as i walk.
4 I'm 5'9 and wear a size 12. this dress runs tts though there is no stretch to it, found the bust to be a tad tight (38c). it is light with good movement. i did not find it short waisted and i thought the proportions were correct. the length was just long enough to make me feel comfortable wearing it. i'm looking forward to wearing it to holiday dinners this season.
1 The print doesn't necessarily works for everybody.
4 I have a curvy figure and have always loved the way pilcro jeans have fit aka plenty of stretch for butt and thighs and small waist. i was really excited to try their skinny,  high waisted version. first, i don't like the faux whiskering on the jeans, i think it makes them look cheap. second, the fabric had more stretch than i'm use to for pilcro denim, and made them feel low quality.  i don't think they are terrible, i just think i should have been more careful about reading the percentages of
4 This robe is such a pretty design. very flowy- runs slightly large in my opinion but was so cute i decided to keep it!
4 I needed to write a review only because i feel like the dress is getting a bad rap by other reviewers. it is a loose, flowy, swing dress. i typically wear structured fit and flare dresses, but i do love a feminine, loose, casual dress from time to time too. this totally fit the bill. it is true to size, fitted on the arms, loose and swingy everywhere else. i got the peach color and love it. the cotton slip underneath is very comfortable too. i ordered the sp and it hits just above my knees in th
4 I am still on the fence with this one. i got it sort of as an impulse buy when i was buying some tops at my local store the other day. the piece is gorgeous and looks great over a black tank top. it is very versatile in that you can wear it so many different ways; as an accent piece over a t-shirt, bathing suit cover up, over a dress. it is a delicate material so i'm sure you have to be careful washing it, but it has a feminine, flowy style that is very unique. the only thing that i'm not sure o
1 This suit was high quality, and a cute design. however, it is clearly made for a lean body type.
1 I loved the dress, but just not dressy enough after rethinking what i needed. very easy order and return. thanks!
4 When this appeared on line, i thought t would be a sure thing, color (blue), cut and style, this dress appeared to have been made for me, but i ultimately i ended up returning it for several reasons. fit: i was worried about the length on my 5'5" frame but it was actually long enough. i have narrow shoulders and average arms but i found the shoulders or maybe it was the upper arms to run slightly small in my regular size which caused some strange poofing at the shoulders. not sure if going up a
4 This dress is adorable. i wore it one time and got so many compliments!it's very light and comfortable. it fits like a shift should - a bit loose. i love it. wish it came in more colors!
4 This sweatshirt is beautiful and a step beyond the ordinary. the white is crisp and the lace is just beautiful. the black striping is subtle and really attractive. i had a problem with the fit. it just grabbed my mid section in an unattractive way. i wear large in more fitted items and that's what i ordered this time. i'm well endowed and it fit nicely over my bust, shoulders and arms so afraid the next size up will be too big. although it didn't work for me i highly recommend this beautiful top
4 This suit is well made, and is so darn cute. i usually wear a 6, but i am a size 8 in this (8 us size, although the main tag is australian size. they send out based on the us size ordered). the only issue i have is that i have a long-ish torso compared to my size, so it's ever so slightly tight in the crotch, but not enough to make me send it back. i have small boobs, so the extra padding is nice. i'm and athletic 5'6" and 130 lbs.
1 This sweater is a lovely color and very soft. however, the sweater 'sheds' terribly and the color is very large distracting from the overall appearance. it's also thin and whatever shirt is worn underneath will show through.
4 I purchased the floral patterned version and get complimented every time i wear it. i found it to be pretty true to size, even after washing. it's a little sheer, so you'd definitely want to wear a camisole underneath for work. it's a great top for spring/summer!
4 I love the muted coloring! this top is generously sized. i have a small bust and it is roomy under the arms. i wish it was less full around the waist area.
4 This top is absolutely adorable, fits small on top and then flares out a bit as shown. i bought it months ago and haven't worn it yet though. might try it with white jeans as shown.
4 I love these pants and have two colors from last season. they are well-made and versatile. however, given the amount they stretch and the summer season for sandals, 30.5 is a tad long for petite. i'll have them hemmed an inch to keep them from dragging on the floor. also, i wish the coral and green came in petite.
4 As stated by others, this is the type of unique retailer product that i love and that makes me return to the store again and again. i would have given it 5 stars if the sleeves were lined and the body length was longer. the sleeves are indeed long, although this adds to the coziness. but i would have loved the body a bit longer like other cardigans have been. i'm looking forward to wearing it as soon as we get a bit more cool here. congratulations, retailer, for a winner!
1 I wanted to love these, they are cute and warm - but they have absolutely no elasticity. i'm so mad at myself for not reading the reviews because i ended up wasting money on shipping 2 pairs of leggings that i ultimately took right back to the store.
4 I ordered these as i was curious of hte fit on my body type (shorter, thighs)... well, it was ok, but in the end, i dind't keep them as i would be better off wearing jeans on casual day, or "real" joggers (as in jogging material).cut was ok, not super flattering, but tapered pants only suit stright legs in my opinion.material was nice enough, din'dt notice wrikling, but i didn't wwear them, jsut tried them on.grey color was nice.
4 1. i'm 5'5" tall, 143 lbs and 38 (36d) - 32 -40 and the medium fit me well.2. my only problem is that the collar keeps falling to the back. i feel like the shoulder isn't cut right to sit on the shoulder. i seem to have this problem a lot with this brand, where the shirt just wants to fall to the back.
4 I have a countless number of maeve dresses, all size 6. bought an 8 after reading reviews and glad i did. fits perfectly for me one size up. only other issue is the cutout in the back. my bra shows unless i'm very careful.
4 True to size and lovely dress, except the arm pit area is tight and pinches. had to return.
4 5'7", 135lbs, 34c, 27-28 waist. typically wear between a 2 or 4 in maeve. bought an 8 in this. blouse is incredibly sweet - the white is beautiful but i opted for the black bc it seemed more internship appropriate. the front and back are completely different lengths - not a traditional high-low. the fabric has little to no give and the back has buttons running down. size up 1 or 2 sizes to avoid popping buttons! gorgeous with jeans or pair with some fun cigarette trousers (cartonnier, for exampl
4 This sweater looks way better in person than in this picture. the secret: try the petite size. loses a star for not having seamed edges , so it might fray or unravel easily-- but of course that clean unseamed cut looks super cute, especially around the neck. also a bit spendy. but let me say again: super cute on.
4 Lovely dress. i did send it back only because the length was below my knee and i prefer slightly above the knee.
1 Even on my 5'1", short-waisted, 100 lb body, this was super short. it was also super boxy. not flattering at all. the blue was a good color but this is going back.
4 This sweater is super cute with the mock neck. i love all 3 colors. i typically wear either an xs or s in retailer sweaters, and purchased a s in this one. now that i've put it on again at home, i'm wondering if i should have sized up to a m mainly due to the sleeves and hem of the sweater being short. i'm 5'6" (and 126 lbs), so not overly tall and don't typically have this issue. i feel like the model (who is likely taller than me) has to have on at least a size l and have the sweater pinned back
4 This is an intriguing looking skirt, with it's sharp diagonal and the "quilted" optic pattern front panel. it's a nice twist on a black pencil skirt. i've been wearing it with a longer, wrap sweater in the cold, but imagine that i'll be able to wear it into the spring and maybe even year round with lighter weight tops. the fabric is a little thin in the back and the diagonal doesn't lie as straight or look as sharp as i'd like but for the sale price i paid, i really shouldn't complain. it's also
1 I didn't realize that the grey sleeves are attached (i assumed that was just an undershirt on the model). needless to say it looks cheap and poorly made. will be returning
4 Dress is actually very cute - i like it better in person than online. the color is a very pretty deep denim blue color. it is cut very roomy/swingy. length is a bit too long in the back for my taste but still like the way it flows. i am very slight of frame and on me there is a lot of extra material but nothing a good tailor can't fix in a jiffy. perfect for a summer day/bbq or casual party.
4 These may be my new go-to pair of jeans. they have just enough stretch and softness that i can be comfortable in these all day. however, i noticed after the 2nd time i wore them, there were pills in the inner thigh area.
4 Super cute and comfortable. has a shape, not boxy.
4 Ok ladies, i love the whole idea behind these pants..cargo, corduroy, what!!!!?? and in a cool different navy color, had to have them. i got my usual size but in petite (i'm 5'5.5" with shorter legs longer torso, usually don't get petite in skinniest, but for some reason did this time) and i have to say the calves of these pants are like compression stockings! the waist and boodie are perfect, but the calves, yikes! but you know how when you want something to work so bad....i ordered my usual si
4 Very cute top but it seems like it won't hold it's shape very long. cheaply constructed.
4 This top is beautiful. so beautiful that i am keeping it even though it is a little bit large and drapey. the fabric has a golden glow to it. the details in the back are darling. perfect for a romantic dinner out.
4 If the dress fits, there is nothing not to love about it. the color, of mine, is exactly like the catalogue and first photo online (deeper and richer than the studio photos). it is not too sheer, as another reviewer reported. it has a slip, and the fabric is beautiful.the issue i've had has been sizing and style. i wear a size 2. i ordered an xs. the dress i received was not the style of the catalogue dress or the first dress in the online photos. i was looking for the very floaty, full dres
4 I purchased a petite size which fit great except for the slip. the slip is at least 2 inches shorter than dress. super comfy and flattering! perfect for fall with at pair of booties.
4 The dress is lovely. the beadwork creates a nice accent. it runs big. i got a size 0, which should work out just fine for me, but oddly it is big and i wish i got a 00. now there aren't any in that size and i will either have to return the dress or tailor it. i would recommend this dress, just consider ordering a size down from your usual.
4 This top is one of my favorites, i can't get over how much i love the design. the dots are adorable and i received a ton of compliments. the back of the top quite a bit longer, and it looks great. my only complaint is that it runs a bit small on the top. even though the shirt is perfectly sized on me, i bent over to slip on my shoe and one of the buttons popped off after less than a minute of wearing it.
4 This jacket is soft, a beautiful color, the perfect length, and incredibly versatile (a fleece jacket that doubles as a blazer) but i was swimming in it! i wouldn't have minded the larger size, but the sleeves looked ridiculous. i wish i'd ordered early enough to try a petite size, but i'm not sure that would've helped. sad to send this back!
1 This looked beautiful online, but the skirt isn't 100% silk - the strips of fabric have different fiber content levels, with most of them containing some level of polyester. parts of the skirt felt like plastic to touch, and one strip has a very prominent gold sheen that looks cheap. overall very disappointing - this is not at all the beautiful silk skirt that it appears to be online.a definite return. i wouldn't even recommend this at first or second cut.
4 I was hoping this dress was a bit thicker, but when i tried it on the fabric was very thin and sheer. because of the body skimming design, this dress likely won't work on many without some serious spanx or body trimming hosiery. if you work out and are very fit, you might like it, but i don't so i'm not that brave! lol
4 This is a beautiful dress but if you have any hips at all you may find it difficult to find the right size. i usually wear a 0-2 p and found that that the op was too snug on the bottom while the 2p was too loose on top. ( for reference 32-26-35). so if you are perfectly proportioned it could work for you.also, note that this is a pencil dress....very slim fitting.....probably best suited for a cocktail party.
4 I loved this top, however had to return as it does run small. by the time it arrived they were sold out in the larger size. like the quality of cloth and stone, however their products do run a size small.
1 I wore this bodysuit once. it had a hole under the arm when i took it off
4 This dress is just my style. i have been waiting for it to go on sale since it hit new arrivals. when the sale hit the extra 30% off, i pulled the trigger. unfortunately for me, it was a little snug in the bust and as a tall lady, the waist hit me at slightly the wrong spot. i am 5' 9" and am a 36d. so if you are tall and busty, this will not be the dress for you just from the way it is cut and manufactured. the skirt section of the dress has a hook underneath the vest section that it is pretty
4 I purchased this tank in white. the material is very soft, but it is very thick, which i was surprised by, but i still like it. the fit is a little boxy. i have an xxsp and it fits a little large. hangs perfectly - just like the photo. i almost sent it back just because of the boxy look, but i think i make it work this summer. going to keep it!
1 I rarely write a really negative review and retailer is my favorite store ever. but this dress is awful. i ordered the black and white. the fabric is very poor quality. the colors are washed out. i almost didn't try it on, but i did and found that, for me, the fit was terrible (though some of the reviewer pictures are cute).
4 Very comfortable and flattering top, but runs a bit large. i am usually a medium and fit comfortably into the small. the blue stripes are not see through, however i saw  the black motif in stores and it's definitely see through.
4 I bought this dress as a birthday present to myself which i wore to a recent weekend vacation to dallas, texas and i absolutely love it. i love the color and the design of the dress as i think it is timeless and i will get a lot of use out of it for years to come. however, this dress is tight in the chest area and i would recommend sizing up. i am 5'10", 156 pounds, and usually wear a us size 6, but when i tried this dress on in a size 6 the dress stopped buttoning up underneath my bust. i end
4 This was a perfectly nice dress, but embroidery was less elegant than i had expected. be sure to look closely at the neckline, where the material is thick and somewhat informal. it's pretty, but doesn't work for me. otherwise, it is a well made, comfortable, easy-to-wear summer dress. (i sent it back, but thought about it for a while first.)
1 I had to review this because i purchased before any reviews were up and now that i've received this dress i'm appalled by all the positive reviews!!! this dress is hideous in person. seriously hideous. and even if you can get past the drapery fabric, it's incredibly restricting. the picture online is so misleading. the dress isn't even an ivory it's more of a pea green! so disappointed.
4 Love the top, it fits wonderfully, and it's lightweight. my only complaint is that it has little loops that are prone to getting caught on things. other than that, it's a great spring top.
4 It's beautiful, but more sheer on bottom than it appears in photo. size up.
4 I purchased this dress as an easy option to throw on after the gym or on a weekend trip without fuss. the fabric is soft, hangs well, and it is well-lined. but it's also a little more bilious than perhaps necessary to be beautiful and flowing. as in, i'm very comfortable in this dress, but it's not a dress i receive compliments while wearing. perhaps it reads as maternity wear without the belt.
4 Great leggings for the price. they are ultra soft and stretchy. a great pair of leggings to relax in. they are very stretchy and only come in 2 sizes s/m, l/xl. i am 5' tall and they fit fine, because usually such generic sizing is too large for my small frame. they are a bit long for a petite person, but tucked into boots and nobody will know.
4 The 'peach' color is actually a lovely shade of rose and the smocked detailing at the shoulder is exquisite - but there are bold stripes of gold lurex running through the plaid. if you like that kind of thing, you'll love this blouse. it hangs well and is a substantial but airy fabric.
4 Tried the xs on in store from an online return, loved the tailoring but the shoulder seams were a bit tight and i'm usually a s in most tops. ordered the s and while it was flowy like some mentioned, it was still tailored on top & flattering. also versatile - wore it with wide leg denim & wedges as well as cut off shorts & boots. my only complaint is as the others mentioned, the almost immediate pilling even before the wash. sad about it because i love it. will keep and give a little extra tlc.
1 I really loved the way this shirt looked on me. it's forgiving and flattering, and really lightweight. the fabric, however, couldn't even withstand half a day's wear without snagging 3 times and developing a hole right in the center. i have no idea how this happened, as i wasn't wearing or near anything that could have pulled at it. such a shame. this could have been a staple wardrobe piece for me.
4 I love this pair to add some color to a plain outfit. however, they ran just a tad bigger than i expected.
4 I am 5'9 and i wear my usual 27 like i always do in pilcro. i am so sad that they are too short. they are 32.5 inches long and it's just too short for my legs even with flats. the fit is great and they run true to size but they are too short for tall girls. i usually buy the wide leg linen pants and those are long enough. these needed to be about an inch longer. i do recommend them if you're a bit shorter :)
4 I'm so glad the other reviewer also found these small. literally, the largest size i have ever bought. but the style is really cute, sort of dapper british boy...
4 I received the sky color in m online.  am definetly keeping it as it is beautiful.  however i wish they had made it a little less wide and more long.  i am 5 3 and could totally size down to a s but even at my height it would be too short.  i like crop tops and waist hitting tops a lot.  but the shortness on this one just looks like it shrunk in the dryer
4 Purchased this in-store today. i'm normally a small, but tried on x-small before trying on my regular size. the x-small fit perfectly. i'm 5"5, 135 lbs, with wide hips and petite derriã¨re. the dress fit well, slightly hugging my bottom. while i don't like things that draw attention to my bottom, with an outward tug or two of the stretchy material of the dress, it fit perfectly. sweater dresses tend to be bulky, so it makes sense to down size. definitely a nice addition to my closet.
4 It is a pretty dress but runs large, i usually wear small and i ordered a regular xs because they are out of petite... it fits and since i am pregnant it works but it is a little large around the waist...the lace is beautiful and the quality is amazing
4 I'm. 5'2 and based on other reviewer's input, i went with a regular rather than petite and the length works well. the top is cute, but it billows out around the waist which isn't apparent on the model. other reviews mentioned that so i bought it anyway with that information and it's fine if you expect that. i'm a 34dd and find it to be a bit tight in the bust.
4 I tried this on in the store, in regular size (i often need petite). i think on this one, i could go either way.the cut is flattering fit and flare, and the colors are rich. i like the "flowery" design, good spring piece in my opinion, as it has components of all kinds of seasons: sleeveless and see-though material, buthe design part is almost like a fine corduroy, very soft. not too flimsy iether.
4 I bought a pair in both black and green. i sized up one size because of previous reviews. i am happy with the fit. they are very comfortable, look good and keep their shape. the only negatives are after two washings, (following the directions-cold water, no dryer), the black has faded and the hook closure on one is difficult to close and the other was barely attached. overall, i would still recommend them.
4 At 5'4" and 140 lbs, this tank is a nice thin under layer. a little low cut for trying to cover cleavage.
4 This dress is beautiful with gorgeous coloring, nice thick, stretchy fabric and wonderful detailing including buttons. the only issue i had with it is that it's does run small, especially in the bust. i'm normally a medium to large, depending on cut so after reading the previous reviews, i ordered a large and it's pretty snug. still deciding whether i will keep or try for an xl, which is doubtful in availability at this point. i ordered it with two other pieces, both of those a medium fit fine.
4 I bought this top in white and my usual size large based on other reviews.  the sleeves are wonderfully long enough for this tall girl, which means that they are likely very long on shorter gals.  i love the style of this t.  the white is slightly see through, but with a nude color bra works ok. i do wish that it didn't cut up so high on the sides.  this probably isn't an issue with shorter people, but i need to wear something under it to avoid showing skin.  i've tried a white camisole under an
4 This top is adorable and looked pretty on, but when i raised my arms the top wanted to rise up and then stay there above the breast level. it didn't settle back into place when i lowered my arms. maybe a larger size would have helped, but then it would have been a boxy fit. i also found it hard to take off, even with the button on the back of the neckline. the length is cropped, so you would want to wear it with a high-waisted skirt or pants. i like the details in the fabric a lot, but i didn't
4 Because of how much i have been buying recently, i didn't *want* to like this dress. i just tried it on because it's such a classic dress. i'll probably wear it all year-round, dress it up or down, and it'll probably last for ages. so i tried it and it's cute. and flattering. and practical. and the scallop neckline in the back is just enough of a tease to be fun without being too obvious. (it does get a bit cold though so adding a scarf is recommended, though maybe not the davy crockett one the
4 I am 5.1 and 113lbs. i ordered the petite size 26 and it fits like a glove. i gave 4 starts as i wish i had less stretch in it but other than that they are perfect length and sooo soft. super happy with the cut and waist height!
1 Bought the gold pair and dripped something on them so spot cleaned them with water only. my white washcloth turned bright yellow. the food came out but surrounding area was super faded. so i returned them, took the second pair home, wore them a few times, they stretched out so much, washed them in cold water and they have splotches that are really light. these pants are way too much trouble.
4 Just a heads up because i didn't notice the pink in the blue motif print until it had arrived. almost sent it back - changes the overall aesthetic, makes it harder to layer in winter, black shoes stand out more etc... but i don't really like the orange print and i'm a red head... so i'm keeping it but it would have been amazing if it were cream and blue. i also bought the emerson swing dress. this dress runs tts (emerson runs a touch larger). i'm 5'5" and the dress came to just barely above my k
1 It's a cute top but once i washed in cold water and laid flat to dry it shrunk and lost it's shape. very disappointed. i am going to return top.
4 I love this dress so much i bought it in 2 colors, it's so soft and cozy, i want to live in it!
4 I ordered my normal size large and it fit well although a bit on the long side. the fabric has a waffle texture that's lightweight but warm and cozy. i got the blue and the color was a bit intense in combination with the tie dye affect and waffled texture. my favorite part are the lighter striations on the neck. that opening is really small. it just didn't suit me, so i returned but recommend giving it a try if it's calling your name.
4 I ordered this dress in the blue color. it is lovely in person - but the petite seemed to run smaller than most petite dresses i buy from retailer. i ordered a 2p - and it was tight in the bust on me. i imagine a 4p would be perfect. i am 117 5'3 34b.
1 Looks fitted on, but this just turned out to be an oversized muumuu on. the fabric also felt cheap.
4 I love the colors, the material, the design details (especially the white pattern at the end of the sleeves). the sweater is super soft and cosy. i got it in s because i wanted it to be nicely fitted. i am on tops between s and m. i am of tall , narrow build and athletic, which means i have well developed but still slim muscles in my chest, arms and shoulders. to accomadate that i often need m even though the rest of me is an s ;). anyhow, i was a bit surprised. in s the sweater fits very snug i
4 I just adore this top! it is so comfy and stylish. i wear it with a little purple cardigan and feel like an iris in bloom. like other reviewers have mentioned though, the straps are way too long. i had to cut them down and re-sew to make it wearable. before that it just slouched in front and looked sloppy and awful. i tried layering under it, which looked absurd.
4 I was looking for a dress that had a lot of color. since i usually stick to neutrals, this was out of my comfort zone, but i found this one and loved it. it's comfortable, not clingy, and i can wear a regular bra (bonus!). i wish the waist wasn't dropped, but i think it worked well. i plan on wearing it more in the spring/summer, dressing it up or down will be easy. i'm usually a size 12 and this fit true to size.
4 This dress will take you through fall, winter and spring. i love all the stitching and design detail. it has a nice swingy skirt that is quite a bit longer in the back.
4 This is a beautiful dress. the detail is amazing, but it runs a little small. i'm usually size 0, but i had to go up a size in this dress. its cut a little too tight, and there is no give in the fabric. otherwise its stunning!
4 Beautiful lace detail and very soft material. runs a little big.
4 I'm a m/l size in most things....depending on the maker and design. i tried this vest on with the paired top in the photo and couldn't believe how big and boxy it was. very boxy. it looked dumpy on my 5'3" frame. i thought it might work because i have broad shoulders to hang the vest off,but noooo. i have breast and that ruined it. well there you go, a size 36c wasn't going to help with this one. but i'm going to try sizing down to a small to give it a chance in fitting better. it runs at least
1 I loved the color and design until i tried it on in the store. i am 5'5" with a slender build. i tried my usual xs but couldn't manage to put this shirt on me without risking smear my makeup or scratch my face by the elastic band at the neckline. the band is so small even fully stretched out. i have a normal sized head just in case you wonder... i gave up after wrestling with it. i can only imagine how uncomfortable to wear something with a tight elastic band choking me...funny... but not funny.
4 This top isn't so much on the hanger but very cute once you try it. the neckline is really cut low so a pin or stitch is necessary. the length on the regular is perfect for my shorter body. if you have a long torso it might not work for you. love how the layers conceal but do not overwhelm your body.  i purchased my regular size medium in black. for reference: 5'6", 145 lbs, 34dd.
4 The prima is soft and silky. they fit true to size, maybe a little tight in the waist. while the color is more of a wine it looks nice with a lot of my fall blouses and sweaters. you will be pleased with this purchase.
4 I am returning this dress as it looks pretty matronly once it's on. the top was also very tight in the arms and chest (i am 5'9", 140lbs, and 34d).
4 The denim is soft and very comfortable, the color also is very dark and goes well with most anything. the style is 'oversized' for baggy look and for that reason the sides of the over-alls gape open requiring a long top. i usually wear a size 4 in citizen jeans, and ordered small in the overalls and had to return for an xs. i do recommend for comfort and fun. they look great with booties or flats and hit just at the ankle.
4 These are beautiful pants - pretty basic, but comfy and you can dress them up. they definitely run large in both length and waist. i'm 5'10" and having a little bit of a platform or heel is helpful.
4 The wide strap style is very flattering. this tank is fitted in my normal size small, it fits like the model in the cobalt blue color. i'm 5'7" 120lbs. if you want more room, i'd size up. it is low cut, but not inappropriately so. fits like the picture shows.
4 I want to the store to try this skirt on. that had only one size m in stock (my size) and it was huge! i ordered an xs and it fits nicely. it's just what i needed for the warm days ahead.
4 Really like this top. colors are great for summer into fall and beyond. can be worn on or off shoulder. it is longer, but not tunic length. covers your bum. i haven't loved a couple of other off shoulder tops i got at retailer, but this one i do. the fabric isn't "puffy" so i don't balloon out under the bust. i am 5'6" 123lbs and 32d. got the small because i wanted length. would have even got the medium but the neckline was too wide.
4 I tried this top in the store and i really like it. i am 5'2", 34b with wide shoulder, tried on my usual size s in both colors and they both fit fine. however, i found that the ivory one fits a little bit loser compared to the blue one (by the way, the blue looked more like dark grey in person). the length of the ivory one seems to be a little bit longer than the blue one as well. since it is a drapery top, i like it to be roomy, so i purchased the loser/longer ivory one. it looks great with a j
4 ... between looking fat and looking like you have a human being on tap (which is way longer than you would imagine). another reviewer mentioned that this makes your boobs look huge when cinched which is true, and also ok since my boobs are huge now. if i wasn't pregnant i'm not sure i would go with this because it definitely has a lot more fabric to it than the model photos make it appear, especially when you cinch. but for 6 months pregnant, this dress made me feel fab.u.lous since it toned dow
4 Nice sweater. i love the detail in the front. i didn't like that it was lined... it seemed too much like a jacket instead of a sweater to me. nice details on the sleeve but the sleeves are a bit long. i have found many retailer cardigans to be a bit on the small side so i sized up with this sweater.no need to do that. this sweater is true to size.i am usually a large and i felt the xl was too big. it fit like a jacket instead of a sweater. the sleeves are too long for my liking (i like 3/4 sle
4 The embroidery on this was beautiful but didn't hang well on my athletic/small chested upper body.
4 This vest is a really cute idea for layering, so i ordered my usual size medium. and while it fit, it just added about 5-10 pounds onto my frame! ehhh the front just has this extra fabric that you are supposed to bunch up and then tie down, but it just made me look so bulky! sizing down wouldn't have helped as the back would have been squeezed in a small. it's a shame because it seems pretty well made and comfortable too. i'm 5'6", 140, and usually wear a 6 or 8.
4 I love the fabric, texture mix and length of this top. i gave it a four stars because my usual size is a medium but had to go with a large. a medium felt a bit too snug through the shoulders. very happy with this top and look forward to wearing it a lot.
4 These are some of the cutest jeans i've seen in a while. i ordered my usual size 28 and they were too big. i'm 5'9" and about 140 lbs. i always were a 28! i reordered the 27, though, and they fit perfectly. the only disappointment was they make my butt look flat and emphasize my stomach, which isn't the case in other jeans. i think it's due to the high waist. they fit almost like a pair of pants. oh well, i'm keeping them. i tucked in a striped sailor tee and they looked adorable.
4 Very comfy dress that you can wear in the summer if it's not too hot and in the fall/winter with boots (tall or ankle).
4 Product was exactly what i wanted. very soft, but very wrinkled upon arrival. will wear it with skinny jeans or even leggings.
4 I purchased this dress before reading any of the reviews. i ended up reading them the day the dress was to arrive---and they worried me, since i was so excited for this dress! i put it on and i feel like it is not much different from the photo here online. it is meant to be roomy. it is more fitted on top, and the back is cute to give it some shape too. but it is meant to be loose fitting. i personally love it. i have added a belt to give it more shape when i want, worn it on its own, or with a
1 This dress fits awfully. it's not short, as pictured in photo. it hit just above my knees. it looked like sack. i would've, also, felt like i was choking  all night with it clasped around my neck. it, potentially, may look okay on someone who is very tall, skinny, and lanky, but i have my doubts about that too.
4 I wanted to love this top but found it to run small and was too sheer for my taste. it is a beautiful top though, but you will need a cami with it.
4 Yeah i know that sounds ridiculous. but this is really a nice piece, the fabric is thin and soft with a little structure to avoid any pajama vibes. the color is perfect, a mid-deep indigo with just enough fading. i don't find it unwieldy or challenging to get on and off, and i like how the fit is adjustable with the waist tie. that said, it does run small. i'm usually a 6/28 and started off with a m. it was pretty form fitting, and the ct risk was at orange level. then the zipper wouldn't stay u
4 This dress looked very flattering on me, i say true to size to slightly small. as mentioned in title, the zipper ended up opening in the middle near where the waist is. the lace is soft and fits comfortably, the waist band is the tighter fit. the skirt is less see-through in the store anyway. darker red in person (overall). hoping the one i tired on was a fluke. the skirt has a bit of pleating to it, or atl east it looks like it...regular size hit me below the knee, almost mid-shin, wasn't t
1 Cut out design, no seems or hems. very disappointed in retailer
4 I bought the neutral color. this is a lightweight tunic sweater that can be worn during spring. the lace detail is so pretty...i ordered my normal size small and would have preferred an extra small...the top flows nice but would've been a better overall fit if i sized down. i'm 5'7 140 lbs for reference. make sure you size down at least 1 size.
4 I received this today and totally bummed it's not cold enough where i live to where this yet. this style of sweater is what initially hooked me into retailer. it looks like one you'd have up in your closet for years. good quality, feels nice, and i love the detail on the sleeve. kind of wish they'd put a little detail on the back, maybe a peek a boo detail of a small flower or another ladybug but overall i'm very pleased.
4 This top is very cute! however, it runs quite large. i ordered my usual size - xs but it looked rather heavy on me. the construction of the top was boxy and didn't produce the same feminine look as it does on the modeled picture. it's a very cute design but i would order a size down for a better fit.
4 I was very excited to receive this dress. i ordered my normal size small, which i should have realized was a mistake. you could fit two of me in that size small. i realize the dress is supposed to be "flowy" but it would have been baggy on me at nine months pregnant. the fabric is soft and comfy and the pattern is cute, but order at least one size down. i'm going to exchange for the xs in hopes of it not resembling a short muumuu.
4 This top is super comfortable and has a great preppy casual look. i have been wearing it on weekends with jeans, but could also pair it with a skirt and tights to have a more work type look. i don't usually like the shorter length shirts, but the fit on this works for me.
4 I never buy shorter shorts, my legs are so muscular that most are unflattering, but these were actually ok. they didn't look loose like the model, but hit a nice spot on the leg, and they have enough stretch to fit me nicely. i even bought the white color... unheard of! i weigh 115 lbs, all legs...
1 After reading the previous reviews i thought sizing down would be a great idea. as soon as i pulled it out of the bag i knew that the xs/s was still wayyy too big. for reference i am 5'3 and a 34ddd and usually wear an 8 but this thing was enormous. it was shapeless and boxy but done so horribly it looked like i was pregnant. it has an adjustable draw string at the bottom which helps to make you look like a balloon. such a disappointment. the design was lovely and it looked very high quality and
1 I ordered a size 16 in the orange. it ran a size smaller than normal size 16 maeve tops. the quality of the material was terrible. it wrinkled and was also so thin that you need to wear a tank underneath. that messes with the look of the lace on the top. the color of the orange was gorgeous.
4 The sweater is thinner than i expected but very cute so i'm keeping it. it seems well made so i'm not expecting easy snags, it washed well.
4 The material and color of the dress were great, but the fit was rather blah. i don't think it was right for my shape. i am disappointed though, i liked design of it.
1 I bought this very cute t-shirt in sky. wore it once, then washed it according to the washing instuctions (machine washable/dryable). this t-shirt turned into a crop top!!!!! i can't wear it. it's going to goodwill. i would suggest that you air dry this shirt, if you want to take the chance that it won't shrink up several inches.
4 I purchased a small in this dress. 5'6" 34d. i could have gone with a medium if i wanted to wear a bra. this dress is not meant to be worn with one. it fit much better without. i liked the regular length as the dress is supposed to be a midi. this dress screams "summer" to me.
4 Now this is a summer staple! love the design of the bib of this tee. super soft, great neutral charcoal color and can be dressed up or down. it is loose, i'd recommend sizing down.
4 The fabric is so thin, i think this entire garment might actually fit in a normal-sized letter envelope. the problem is not going to be that the garment is see-through (which it is) - it's the fact that the super thin fabric is not silky, it's cotton-ey, and i suspect it will get "stuck" against the back of my shirt/pants while i'm wearing it and not drape nicely. i wonder if some tiny weights could be sewn to the bottom hem to keep it laying properly.....however, i'm such a sucker for a pre
4 Over all this is very cute . it is very short. but has very good quality material.
4 This dress is modern yet timeless, cute yet rock and roll if worn with boots. i am 36b, 26 waist, 36 hips, and size regular s fits well. i like regular size because it is longer in the torso (lengthens waist for a belt) and the length is right above the knees, appropriate for work. the bust area fits me perfectly so well-endowed ladies may want up a size. i am into grey now but all colors are gorgeous, love the sheen, colors are true like shown (1 star off for hi price for a simple dress).
4 I wanted this this top when i saw it online but was hesitant when i read the review however i went to the store and was able to try it on, good thing. i'm not a fan of the off white/beige material but really like the black style. i had no problem with the shoulders staying down. idid get it in a small a size up for me.
4 Love the design of this top. wish i could have gotten it in white but was sold out. it fits nicely overall, but is a little snug in the stomach area. still kept it though, because the shirt is just so pretty!
1 The yellow is not as bright as the pic and the tee shirt base color is more off white/oatmeal making the shirt look much more drab in person than in the pics. fit was ok but nothing special about this and will be returning.
1 There was nothing i liked about this coat. it was definitely not designed with a chest in mind. the pins on the straps were already coming off the first time i tried it on. i usually like oranges too, but even this color turned me off.
4 I haven't worn this yet, but i can't wait too! i'm 5'3 145 pounds, ordered a size small. it's fits perfect! in fact, it's long enough that i may be able to pull it off as a mini dress on a hot day. that said, i will mostly layer this piece. the ruching on the side flatters the body. i would buy this in more colors if it was available! also, the material is a nice soft quality.
4 I like this dress because it's the perfect shape on me and i think the design is modern and cute. i got the red and i really like the pattern and the subtle tulle edging. the material is a little stretchy and substantial and there's also a lining. i wore it with little booties like the model and tights and a cropped moto jacket and loved the outfit. i am short, small chest, but somewhat broad shouldered, the empire waist would not work on larger chested women with hourglass figures.
4 Loved the dress, but the white of the dress was neon white, way too bright and made it look terrible against my skin. i can imagine this looking good on someone with darker skin. but i"m my pale skin it looked bad. otherwise the fit was great, besides missing out on the petite sizes which are sold out.
4 Great dress, comfortable to wear and flattering, with the stretch cinch waist and the soft flare of the skirt i feel flirty and fun with its open scoop neck and dipping back. plenty of space and simplicity to accessorize or not. i bought it in black/white and red, each with its own feel.
4 This is a really cute skirt, and it seems well-made (good stitch-work and enough weight to the fabric that i'm not worried about underwear show-through but not too heavy for a summer skirt). i sized up from an 8 to a 10 because it was difficult to get the skirt over my bum. also, the zipper doesn't lay flat when i have it in the back of the skirt so i just shifted it to the side--still looks great imo. i think if you have hips or a booty you might want to size up on this skirt. color is true to
1 I'm usually a maeve fan. i found this top to look cheap and fit poorly. it is also very thin material and showed everything.
4 I found this skirt ran very small and i had to go up a size from what i usually wear. maybe it is meant to be worn really tight as the fabric seems to contain a lot of spandex. i really like the longer length. it feels like a good sturdy fabric. i haven't washed it yet, but i'm hoping it doesn't fade or shrink.
4 It is beautiful, but not practical for me - the student who carries a backpack ! i didn't notice it doesn't have sleeves, it is regular poncho, soft and stylish . recommended for poncho lovers !
4 I fell in love with this dress when i saw it. i am usually a petite, so i knew it would hit me just above the ankle, but it works! what is lacking from the description is the under slip that comes with the dress. it is a knee length, cotton jersey slip that is bulky and uncomfortable - thus the 4 star rating instead of 5 star. i won't use the slip, so this makes the dress fairly sheer when backlit. otherwise, the dress is well made and the addition of the piping at the seams makes it special. i
4 I normally wear an xl, but could only find this instore in size large. the blouse fits nicely, but i think it would come down a bit lower and also be a longer blouse if i would have purchased it in my usual size. the blouse itself has a nice drape to it. the black 'railroad tracks' look very pretty in person, and add a nice detail. the only complaint i have with this blouse is the sleeves. the enormous bell sleeve feels like a costume. but for a nominal fee i had the sleeves shortened to a ruffl
4 Good quality jeans, but had to return, as they did not fit my curvy hips.
4 Looking forward to wearing this on a beach holiday !
4 Love this dress.  wear it with sneakers or boots.  can add a belt, or the right accessories to dress it up.
4 I ordered this online, but i own the vest and i love it, so i took a chance. this is a super comfy, great quality jacket. the sleeves are some kind of knit material and that makes it really cozy and not constrictive. the color, i ordered the green, is perfect. i ultimately returned the jacket because i thought the lapels were just too wide for my liking. they look exactly like the picture so if you don't mind that, you will probably be very happy with this jacket. it just wasn't for me. i ended
4 This dress is beautiful. it was on back order and i waited about three weeks to receive it. i usually wear a size 8 in retailer but because it was a button down dress, i ordered a size 10. the bottom is a great fit but the top is difficult to button. it is a heavier weight so i feel it is better for the spring than the summer season.
4 Very cute everyday tee. usually run between an xs or small with retailer and was happy i chose the extra small. a great updated on a classic strip tee.
4 For reference: 5'3, 130#, athletic/muscular body type (broad shoulders, slim hips)i wanted to love this dress soooo much, i wanted it for holidays, and special occasions, but my broad shoulders and 34d chest worked against me. the criss-crossed bodice accentuated my larger top, and there wasn't enough poof in the skirt to balance me out. i'm sure this will work beautifully on other body types, and i wish it worked on mine too! a sparkly necklace or dangling earrings and a high bun are all you
4 I just received this in the mail and really enjoy it! it's a nice color and very gauzy/ airy. the only think i didn't love is that it's a little bit in the chest area, which is rare considering i'm usually a m in that area.
4 I really wanted to like this since i've purchased previous byron lars dresses and have never not been complimented on them. however, the picture on this one is misleading. the colors are extremely bright, which on my pale skin makes me look washed out. for example, the border on the collar is actually more hot pink where in the picture here it appears almost white. the brightness and business just didn't work on me. that being said it still fit like a glove. 5'11 and 145 pounds and the size 4 wa
4 Nice quality, definitely need to wear a tank top or camisole cause this doesn't come with it. color is great not too bright. true to size. if you want short length zed a petite size.
4 There is so much i love about this dress. like many of the other reviewers i simply love the fabric. it's soft and comfy but has texture and interest at the same time. there's beautiful detail to it as well. the edging at the neckline and hemline are unfinished and beautifully so. having said all that, i like many other reviewers i just don't have the body type to pull it off. there wasn't one angle that didn't make me look even bigger than i am. the pleating in the front, while very cute, gave
4 Imo this top does run small. arms were tight in the size xs and just a bit snug in the s. top is definitely versatile. i don't usually wear peplum tops due a larger chest (34d-dd) and they usually look like maternity tops on me, however this one did not. the problem with this top is the fabric in the back of the top is shearer than i'd like. you can see every bulge and bump of your bra. i felt you'd need to cover your back with either long hair, jacket, vest or cardigan. not a deal breaker becau
1 I waited three months for these pants. when they finally arrived, i was mostly pleased. they seemed like the staple pant everyone is raving about. and they should have been.problem one: they bag out. i got one wear out of them before i needed to wash and hang to dry (regained shape then).problem two: the crotch split! in the front! i'm a teacher. i sincerely hope no one noticed! i read other reviews about this problem and don't know if i got a bad batch or if a similar fate is awaiting other
4 This is a cute waffle t-shirt material is very thin and see-through it's a cute shape and style but it runs absolutely huge  is not a shirt for petite people the extra extra small was huge
4 I bought this for the office and received many compliments about it. it puts the outfit together just right and the material is very comfortable. it fits my need for comfortable clothing that still looks good enough for a business setting. this jacket is more comfortable (almost slouchy) than it is structured.
1 The fabric is very nice on this wrap, but it wears like a blanket.
4 Lovely sweater. it fits baggy and form fitted somehow. i like the multi-fabric look. however, the main body of the sweater does shed!!! like, i just held it up to my body to look at it in the mirror and the shirt i had on was covered. haven't washed it yet, so can't speck to that, but i'm guessing it will lose some of that in the wash.
4 Just a cute, casual tee that i grabbed on sale, but i love the bow in the back! something unique for an otherwise plain tee!
4 The style and color is very nice but the fabric is a bit stiff. the fabric doesn't have much give and isn't as comfortable as most of my other retailer t shirts. still a cute top for the cooler weather.
4 I am very happy with my purchase. it is a great sweater! very easy to wear and cute! i am very sensitive to scratchy wool products and this one is very soft. i highly recommend it.
1 I was so excited to receive this dress only to come find out that it was not tweed, not the same colors as the picture, spandex material, the fit runs smaller than most of their dresses and the sleeves are capped. i love retailer and prefer their clothes above all other brands but i was extremely disappointed in this dress.
4 I love this suit. it is a really cute color way & stripe and the fabric is nice, but... i ordered an xl. i have 20-30 extra pounds on me leftover from my last child. i am currently wearing a 10 or a 12. this suit would be great for a thinner girl, but i could not wear this suit to the family pool. the bottom is cut kind of skimpy and the breast area does not have much support. this xl would be a better fit on an 8-10. it will need to go back.
4 I bought this dress to wear to work in my second trimester. the shape is perfect to accommodate a baby bump while still flattering the top. definitely recommend for any pregnant women trying to avoid true maternity clothes!
4 A scandalous mini skirt that isn't a skirt! beautiful pattern. does run a little big.
4 I really really like this tunic. it is gorgeous! but it runs small. i tried in l, usually wear l/xl, i may need to try the xl. but i sent it back because it just too expensive. the fabric itself is thick and heavy. i didn't like the fabric much, i wish it were softer. especially for such a gorgeous tunic. it was hard to send it back, but i may try the larger size in the store. i think i need 2 sizes up, it runs too small.
1 I wanted to love this sweater but it is a return. it is a very weird fit, very thick, rug-like material and unfitted. the shoulders are bulky, the top is big and the booty is small. i am 5'2", 34c and typically wear a small. the arms were very long, way too long. i will say other than that the top was true to size, may look okay on someone who had a larger chest and a smaller bum!
4 I love this robe and can't wait to wear it while i'm getting ready for my upcoming wedding. the only con that i can see is that the sleeves are a bit baggy, but other than that it's perfect!
4 This is a great basic tee (purchased in navy) but fits much larger than it appears on the model. the arms/chest area fit fine but it really billows out below. the front is shorter and the back is longer than i would've expected. i thought this would be great for summer, but it's really too long in the back to wear with shorts. it does, however, look great with skinny jeans.
4 I usually wear xl in tops at retailer, but i picked this one up in a l. it's stretchy and super soft, but doesn't breathe all that well.
4 I purchased this sweater in the blue and i love the color. at first i bought the regular size extra small. i am 5/2" and 102 pounds. i had to return the xs for the xxs petite. i like the arms to be long so i don't usually purchase sweaters in the petite sizes, but this one in the xxs petite the arms are still plenty long enough. it is still very roomy. it is very soft and comfortable, slightly itchy, i wear a very thin long sleeve shirt underneath.
4 This is a darling dress!  it is super flattering . . . except if you are a swimmer and have broad shoulders.  unfortunately i had to return it because it pulled so tightly across my shoulders/chest.  i ordered a size 4 and it was actually true to size other than failing to accomodate for an athletic upper body.  i'm 5'4", 118 lbs.  wish i could have kept this one!
4 Pros: versatile summer weight t. perfect with jeans. flattering cut. nice color palette. made in the usa. reasons for not giving 5's for overall rating and quality... shirt is a bit short overall (i'm 5'4). fabric is thin and a mixed blend of poly, cotton, and rayon. will have to be careful with washing. better if you can purchase on sale. regular price was steep for a t-shirt.
4 This dress is such a lovely thing to have in my closet- it's so easy to pull on, but adding a nice pair of shoes, a piece of jewelry, and leaving my hair down reveals a gorgeous outfit that takes next to no time. i must admit, my local store didn't stock this dress so i wasn't quite expecting the texture of the fabric (i was expecting it to be smooth but it's almost ribbed?). it's soft and comfortable though, so that's certainly not a deal breaker. i only wish they'd had it in petite as i feel t
4 This skirt was too big so i returned it but did like it well enough to re-order. quality seems average; my only complaint is the lining seems too short for the skirt. why, on a maxi, is the slip lining a mini? the first thing my husband said was that it needed a slip. he didn't think it had one as he could see through the skirt to my knees. this is very lightweight fabric but could be worn all year around depending on the leg wear that is worn with it. it is a very versatile piece which is why i
1 The dress is pretty, i ordered a 4 and 6 not knowing how it ran, i took both back the neck is too tight!
4 This bra is incredibly comfortable but not meant for practices that involve a lot of movement (i.e.: vinyasa) but is perfect for lounging and personal practice. the orange is a beautiful color
4 I bought this dress on clearance and think it will be cute next summer, on a super-hot day with ballet flats. i have no idea what it's doing in the fall collection. am looking forward to wearing it 10 months from now!!
4 It is gorgeous, and yes, the side slits are very high, but i am still keeping and rocking it. i am a size 10-12 and got the large, probably could have got the medium, but after a few washings, i think the larger size will be ok. side slits high, but if the weather is good, and you have self tanner on legs, it looks great with shortie boots. i have gotten many cmpliments on it, just hope it still keeps its shape after a long day of wear. very pretty in cream, though, i do recommend it. i am 5'8,
4 This top is very airly and swingy.  definitely need to wear skinny jeans to off set the volume on top.  it is a pretty top and also unique so i kept it.
1 I agree with the other reviewer about the great colors, but when i took this off the rack to try one, you can see through both layers of fabric. i thought, insulting quality, for the price. i imagine the holes would start after one wearing.
4 I really like this top. is casual and easy to wear with short right now and will be super cute with jeans when it gets cooler.
4 So i can see why this might not be an amazing shirt, it runs a little large imo and its long. i'm 5'5" and its almost to my knees, but......as a nightgown, it's amazing! super comfy and its now my new favorite pajama dress. lol. i might wear it as a shirt too, but most likely just jammies!
4 This is a cute casual dress. i've received many compliments and wear it a lot. i deducted one star because the dress is pilling in some places (mostly expected friction areas, but others as well). also the back of the dress started to rip at the stress points for the button up area. i mended it, but it should have been reinforced to begin with for a dress at the original price point.
4 This is a super cute dress and i get lots of compliments when i wear it.
4 Happy with this top- slightly thinner material than i was expecting but that'll be fine with our hot summers. got the navy striped one- very pretty and extremely soft. washes well. i do wear an tank underneath though bc the armholes are slightly large and you can see part of my bra.
4 I fell for the charcoal one and bought standard size m/l. on first wearing with slim jeans, booties and a long sleeved t, the body of the vest was fine. but with wavy shoulder-length hair, i found the large, wide collar overwhelming at the top. i tried folding the collar under, as in the photo of the gray one, but still too much. i altered it by paring it down by 7 inches at the back neck, and tapering down to meet the lapel at mid-chest. the fabric looks like boiled wool, but is actually a tigh
4 Great dress for fall! runs slim through the hips and neckline is a little low.
4 I purchased this top in the navy. the picture makes the top look like an interesting blue with some purple in it, but in person the top is just... navy. the lace and fabric are soft. it fits true to size; i almost always wear a small and the small fit fine. it wasn't quite my style, but it's a pretty top that will be great for spring and summer.
1 This may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried. the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo, absolutely garish. the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties, it just looks cheap. the skirt is an antebellum nightmare.  i did not even want to try it on, it's that bad. i considered adding a photo, but was too horrified.for reference, i'm 5'10", approximately the height/ size of the model, but it was shorter than the photo depictes. i wanted to like it,
4 This is a lovely embroidered (hard to see in the pictures) shift that i purchased to wear to a fancy fundraiser. it has vintage '60s lines that are fun. very forgiving fit. i am 5'5" 125 lbs with a 32dd bust and purchased a 4 petite (for a great price!!!). i might alter it so it has a bit of a waist curve, but that is minor.
4 I fell in love with this top when i saw it online. i love tracy reese! the pattern is beautiful and the yellow is even brighter in person. i ordered a size small even though i normally wear an xs in all tops. for whatever reason, there was no xs offered, which is odd. the straps are adjustable which is good but unfortunately you absolutely cannot wear this top without fashion tape to keep the straps from falling off your shoulders. the straps slipped off my shoulders constantly. i wore a coobie
4 I am 5 feet and 120 lbs. i ordered the honey. quality was excellent. no button issues. fits true to size. i ordered a small petite. my issue was the chino fabric was too casual. it's okay. if it were on sale i would keep it, but not at full price. color is as shown in the honey. no issues on arm length. but i like mine a little longer. it's kind of menswear. which some gals would like. i am a 34 c and it only looks good buttoned up on me. i'd say if your on the fence give it a try. it's tts.
1 Uhm no. oh dear, no. i was initially drawn to this blouse's lovely fabric, the color and pattern are truly stunning. i decided to give it a try because it seemed somewhat boxy, oh boy was i right. sadly, this is one of the least flattering tops that i've ever tried on at retailer. it might be a great maternity top, though.
4 Hack: wrap the sash around waist twice and tie in back!! agreed with other reviewers it is a bit sack like when the sash tied in front as seen on model. but wrap twice, and it makes the silhouette pop. fabric is rediculously lush, and pattern is very sophisticated. stunning dress, will be wearing all summer -- with flats for work, with heels for evening. oop, my usual size, fits perfectly (5'4, 110 lbs).
4 1. i'm 5'5" tall, 145 lbs, and 38-32-40. i'm normally a size 10, but i took a 12 in this skirt.2. it's comfortable and has pockets that you can really put your hands in.3. sits at high waist. hem hits below the knee.4. i didn't like the buttons. they are very round and stick out quite far. they are also mismatched. i would have liked them better if they were flatter.5. i also didn't like the mustard color. it's unflattering to me.
4 Really pretty. not very itchy and a great sweater to dress up or down.
4 I really liked this top. i wish it was not so sheer. even with a nude bra, its just too much. it's a very loose fit throughout the body, but the shoulders, arms, and neckline remain true to size so it looks nicely tailored on the top. i just can't do something this sheer. i feel too exposed. i wish they had it offered in other colors.
4 I usually wear a medium in tops from deletta so i would say this top is true to size. i personally loved the fit. in the front, the seam goes up slightly to follow the bust line. there are some gathers in that area as well so that any little bulges in the tummy area are hidden. the fabric falls nicely there. the seam at the waist on the side and back hit exactly at my waist. i love both of the prints. the tops seem to be well made. time will tell.
4 When i saw this top.... i had to have it.....runs very small... would size up especially if curvy on top.......sheer but not too sheer...... feels and looks delicate...... no problems so far
4 This dress fits true to size. i ordered an xs like i usually wear as a small was falling off of me when i had tried on in store. the colors are more vibrant in person. it's a really pretty dress and is very well made. the fabric is solid and light weight. i don't think it would work for someone with a lot of curves unless they sized up though as it is a really straight dress that is meant to lay free.
4 Cute, basic white shirt with nice detail. i love meadow rue and this is another great shirt from them. while i love it, i wish it were just a little bit softer (i am a sucker for soft things). however, i am keeping the shirt and it will be great for work or play.
4 Not my typical sleepwear, but glad that i took a chance, as it is super cozy for lounging. i was worried about covering my bottom (as i purchased the matching leggings), and ordered s based on prior reviews. ended up exchanging for xs as it was too oversized. could have purchased the petite probably as xs is still a bit long (5'2"), though fits like in photos.
4 The design is very cute. i'm glad i listened to reviews b/c this blouse definitely runs at least 2 sizes small maybe 3. i bought the blue and it's more of a navy blue instead of royal blue. at the sale price and additional 40% off (my daughter is an employee) i didn't mind paying $24 :).
1 This looks nothing like it does on the website. it runs small and the colors are so muddy. it doesn't drape nicely and i a musually an xs and this was short, stiff and plain ugly. sent it back immediately.
4 I really like these pants - great color and design. they are even lined! unfortunately, they do not work on my curvy frame - all the usual problems: waist too large, hips too small. sadly, i am taking them back.
4 I tried this jacket on and found it extremely flattering. the knit is soft and feels more like a sweater than a jacket in that it isn't constricting. i am usually between a small and medium and the small was plenty big. the fur collar is a special touch. the one i tried on had several loose threads hanging from the seams and the seams puckered a bit here and there. i loved the jacket but did not feel that the quality in construction i would expect was there. however, the fit is so flattering i m
4 I saw this in stores and ran right up to it because of the gorgeous embroidery work and vivid colors - unfortunately those bright colors are totally washed out in the online model pics...barely recognizable! the fabric itself is super soft and not at all stiff, plus it has pockets! i can see this looking great with leggings and boots, but the sleeves flared a little too much which i think would add bulk under a cardigan, so it might not carry as far into cooler months as i would like. my usual s
4 This shirt is nice and flowy. it can be dressed up or down. very lightweight for summer, but the color will work for early fall too.
4 I tried this tunic on in my local retailer store. they do not carry petites, so i tried on a regular small (i'm 5'2", 130lb). the proportions were a bit off. the v-neck fell way too low and there was extra material puckering across the bodice. i definitely think a petite would work better for my height. alas, no petites in-store or online in the color(s) i would purchase. i didn't find the shirt too thin, as some have commented. it's essentially a midweight t-shirt material (but rayon, so beware o
4 This was an unexpected surprise. i love the material of this short sleeved (almost sweatshirt) summer tee. the entire design reads late summer stripes with a cozy twist! the first time i wore it made me realize how tricky it can be to wear stripes and this design deconstructs all my previous hangups!
4 Beautiful dress for those with a large chest and small waist. sadly i am not one and needed to return the dress. fabric is heavy and the pattern is great.
4 I wanted to love this top, but similar to many of retailer's styles (especially this season), this top is very large and tent-like. normally i like a larger top, but i was not expecting the length of this top. it might be cute belted if that is your style, but still much more like of a tunic than a top - could also make a nice maternity top. i am 5'7" and ordered a medium and this top hit me much lower than pictured on the model. the fabric and pattern, as well as the neckline are very nice
1 I tried this dress on in the store. i loved the fabric and color, but the fit was huge, no matter how much i sized down. there are full dresses and tunics that are supposed to be loose, but this was shapeless in an unflattering way. i was attracted to the style and color, but the execution left much to be desired.
4 I just tried it on and it fits well, with no extra room. it seems like a nice fall piece to have in your wardrobe. the color leans more towards green. now i have to figure out what to put on top when i wear it!i think it will be cute with boots.
1 1. this looks so cute on the model, doesn't it? i have no idea where you wear a suit with hot pants, but it looks cute.2. that said, keep in mind the model is probably 6 feet 10 inches tall. i'm 5 feet 6 inches tall, and this jacket came down to my knees. i'm not kidding. the 3/4 length sleeves were at my wrist, so more like 7/8 sleeves.3. i'm normally a size 12 in cartonnier jackets, but this only comes s, m or l. the medium is really a size 10, which was too tight across the shoulders and
4 I thought i'd add a review because a lot of this landscape-print tee was still available at my local durham, nc store (the week after xmas anyway). it's a little different in person than how it appeared online (when it was still available). the white cotton is definitely a cream or off-white. and the silkscreen is darker colors and much more metallic than shown. the metallic is a subtle gold. it's definitely 3/4 sleeves, which i like and it has a curved bottom hem. the surprise to me was that it
1 This dress is huge. i am normally a l-xl regular in retailer brands. i love a loose, flowy dress. after trying one on in the store (just a random returned petite xl) i ordered the petite medium. and it was still huge and not flattering. so sad. i wanted to love this- loved the material and colors, but way off.
4 I was hesitant to try this on because honestly, it looked so short. however, i just bought this at my retailer store and it is very flattering on! 1st of all, it runs big. my normal size (12) was way too big and i had to go down a size. i could have gone down 2 sizes but the length became problematic. in my regular size (that was too big), the skirt hit me a few inches above my knee. perfect! in the size smaller, it was a tad higher; wish it was the same longer length as the 12 but still acceptabl
4 This is as beautiful in person as online, but the length is shorter than the description, and the arms are tight! although i am 5'1", i normally wear regular sizes in retailer just fine; however, the 28" length scared me off, so i ordered a 2p. it says it's 26.25" long, but it's actually just about 24". and my normal sized arms struggled to fit into the sleeves - yikes! but it's gorgeous and was purchased with a gift card, so i will keep :-)
4 Love this top, but the xs is still way too big, swallows me. 5'1" petite. wish it came in a petite offering. sadly, had to return this item.
4 I have the moss colored pilcro skirt that is out right now in an 8 and love everything about it. ordered this in an 8 and it is tight! sending it back. it is very pretty though. just don't love enough to exchange for correct size.
4 The navy version of these pants are beautiful. the contrast gray stripe is subtle and slimming, and continues through details in the pockets.i am 5'6", 34-26-38 and i wore a size 4 regular and 4 petite. the regulars were very long, and even heels couldn't help them. the pant leg covered my foot, covered my toes. the petites were much better (and i rarely order petite). they hit the bottom of my foot with no heels, so i think a heel would make them look right. i'm just not sure if the petite
4 Beautifully constructed tank--but the bodice isn't fitted and hangs straight down on me--perhaps better for a full-figured individual (i'm 5' 8", 34b, 120lbs and the xs had no shape on sides). could've been longer too. size of armholes is perfect though (often they gap/show bra).
1 The fabric was nothing special (i usually like a cotton/silk blend woven fabric, but this was stiff feeling) and the pattern was cute. but what made me return it was the fact that 1) the rose gold glitter dots are puffy paint. literally. puffy. paint. and 2) the dots were not quite dry on my top when it arrived. parts of the paint came off on my fingers and the top was stuck to itself because of it. i could barely unfold it.i'm sure this could have been cute, but who wants a top that looks lik
4 I love these! they are cute enough to wear out, and they are really comfortable. i ordered a small and at 5'3" they are a little long but they shrunk in the wash and they're still totally wearable
4 The colors of this top are my favorite part, i want to hold onto summer for as long as possible and this time lets me do that!
4 Sadly, this shirt was too short for me. i'm 5'11" and have had a hard time with some of retailer's shirts lately. but it is absolutely beautiful and the fabric feels expensive and it's well made.
4 The colors are amazing, the fabric is beautiful; my only complaint is the cut. i am 5'8" 130 lb and always a medium. i put the sweater on and the armhole area was short so it kept riding up- it almost fit like a petite with the higher cut in waist tailoring. i liked the sweater color and fabric so much i exchanged for a large.
4 I liked the jeans, but exchanges them for ag's stevie ankle jeans due to the difference in length. i love pilcro, but these were just a bit too long on me.
4 Gorgeous laser cut top layer in a true vermillion red, oh la la! style is feminine, elegant, and appropriate for all ages.  i plan on wearing this for the upcoming holiday season as well as valentine's day 2017!  quality is top notch and fit is true to size all be it a little snug in the sleeves.  for reference i'm 34e-30-40 and the size 8 worked, i would have like to have tried the 10 but the store only had an 8.  the arms are a little snug, nothing uncomfortable, just snug. length is below kne
4 So this dress is absolutely gorgeous! my problem is i am 5'10" and it is very short wasted. between the shoulders and waist and even the arm holes it just plain doesn't work. i think if you are taller this dress just won't work. i have purchased other items from this name brand and have had the same problem.
1 Was so excited to get this dress because i thought it was cute and i love flowy and big dresses - however this looks huge. the material is not soft so it doesn't fall well. it just stays proofed out so from the back you look like a giant!!
4 I got both colors as i'm not sure when a style that is so perfect for me will come around again. these are beautifully designed and very slimming. they are described as crops but i am 5'5" tall and the length is perfect, approximately 1/2 above the heel of my shoe. no alterations required!!! usually retailer pants are extremely long for me but these citizens of humanity cords are the perfect length. the colors are just as pictured-i was surprised by another review that described the navy as
4 I love the look of this tee, casual, but with some interesting details that make it more flattering and wearable than a plain tee. i tried on my regular size xs and it was large and frumpy, so i was initial disappointed. however, when it was on promo i decided to try the xxs, and it made a huge difference. if you size down it is great and looks like it does on the model. i ordered the coral and it is a beautiful color. the dye seems to be uneven, as it is darker in some parts. for this reason i
1 I was very disappointed in the quality of this top. the first time i wore it it snagged right in the front. i had to pull the thread under so it wasn't exposed. i put it in the wash in the gentle cycle and it was destroyed with several more snags when i removed it from the machine. this top is extremely delicate and doesn't withstand normal everyday casual wear although it's s casual lightweight sweater. now it's just a wear around the house ratty throw around shirt.
4 This gorgeous dress arrived today. the color is beautiful, but the sizing? way off. i cannot move my arms -- it is extremely snug across the shoulders. but, the rest of the dress is loose, as shown in the picture. if i went up a size to fit my shoulders, i'd be swimming in this dress. so, all you gals out there with anthletic tendencies: beware of this dress. it is for women without shoulders/with tiny arms. too bad. this is otherwise gorgeous & would look great worn over a sexy slip with the bo
4 Found this dress on the sale rack, but the store did not have my size. fortunately they were able to order & ship it free. the colors & fabric caught my eye right away. it reminds me of a vintage apron print, but in a good way. i'm tall with a long torso & ihad to lower the waist tie.
4 Ok, the material is great, light & airy. the thing they don't show you is the waist line is tucked in the photo, that's why you cant see the bi level hem line. the hem line is fantastic. the waist is the problem, the whole dress just hangs huge from bust down. the material is so light i would caution against darting the dress. i created a button loop cinch under the outside corer of the pockets, on the seem of the waist. this worked for me.
1 I was hoping these would be like some of the lace shorts i bought from retailer last year that i loved so much. sadly, no. first of all they run small. i am between a s and xs in most brands, bought a s in these because i like my shorts on the looser side. these felt a little snug and short, but i decided to keep them. the first time i washed them, they were ruined. i followed the directions exactly and even put them in a lingerie bag in the washer, plus a delicate cycle, no dryer. the lace is man
4 I was a bit dubious of the top because online the video of it made the top look frumpy - wide and wrinkled looking. the top seemed shorter in the video than in the pictures. so i wondered if the images were massaged a bit in photoshop. i got it today and it's fully lined and the material is pretty thick which gives it a rich look and feel. i like the top even though it highlights my hips a bit and being pear-shaped i don't normally like that, but being thin helps. the best part of the top is the
4 Following another reviewer's advice, i ordered up to an xl. it's huge. stick with your normal size or go down one. it's a one of a kind piece. soft, lightweight, yet cozy and adorable. sadly have to return mine.
4 I picked this dress up off the rack on a whim, and did not expect to love it. i was so delightfully surprised! this dress is made of a lovely, thick, starchy cotton--i found i didn't require a bra. which is great because the back is a gorgeous feature of the dress. the white band across the midsection makes the waist appear small. the dress has sort of a retro feel with the tea length and looks best with heels. i did note a little bit of gaping under my arms but not enough to keep me from buying
4 The design is unique and stands out.  goes great with a black pair of jeans and can be dressed up.  i found the fit to be decent - not unflattering on me. however, i suspect that it could run short / tight on others.overall though - a cute white top for winter.
4 Great dress - fits tts (i am a 6p and purchased a sp). looks good with boots or ballet flats.
4 The dress is very pretty! i ordered for a wedding and thought it was a little casual for that. in the end i returned because it wasn't very flattering for my figure.
4 My kids gave me this blouse for christmas in my usual size 6. it was so tight through the chest, shoulders and arms. i ended up having to exchange it for at size 10! there was barely any difference in the size 8. unfortunately, i now need to have the sleeves shortened, but as this blouse is so cute, it's worth the effort.
4 I ordered this as it was either in stylist pick or top rated, cant' remember which, but i must say, ti was very nice on. a little loose, but the petite sizes are sold out, so i ordered the xs (petite might have been too short...) the cut is feminine, not figure hugging, but still flattering. i can see wearing this in the fall with boots and a cardigan, not just summer with sandals, so i decided to keep it. 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist.
4 Fyi the neck does have a hook and eye closure so there is room to get it on and off. the fabric is not stretchy. the lining is a nice navy. however, the sleeves are not lined. the cut outs have a beautiful blue lace behind it. it hit me at my waist. i'm 5' 3" , 118#. i loved this top. worked with a pair of the new essential skinny trouser by retailer, and the nansen pointelle cardigan in yellow. this also paired well with a pair of rust colored skinny pilcro with a long necklace.
4 This suit is so beautiful, and the quality is great. i wanted it to work out, but unfortunately my chest size is not compatible with this bathing suit. i am a 36c and there is zero support (which i assumed when i ordered it, but it was so lovely in the photo i had to give it a try). for those who have a smaller bust, or are more comfortable with a little sexy side profile, this may be perfect. i ordered the large, and the bottoms were a good fit. i am also very petite and the length was good one
1 I ordered this in a size 1 which i thought would be a small and it was very, very wide. it is very short too. i typically wear a small and am 5'8" and 132 lbs. it's going back unfortunately. very soft material though.
4 This looked really pretty but i think i am just too short for it. a little on the wider side. would look good on someone taller
4 I found these jeans to be more fitted than slouchy. for reference, i'm 5'4" and 160#. i'm heavier thru the hips and thighs and ordered both the 31 & 32 petite (i usually take 32 p in pilcro) and the 32 fit well but was by no means slouchy. however, still very flattering and unique. i had purchased the other pilcro em in 32 p and they did fit looser and i would also recommend that style. always count on pilcro for great fit and style.
4 Very good quality. love the length of it. i wore it with a belt, since on me without it looked a bit too big. i bought the blue one.
4 First of all i love retailer, i am 67 yrs old and my whole closet comes from the store. this jacket is way cute. the color is very nice and the fabric is nice. only complaint is i wish the cuffs were just a bit tighter/smaller.
4 This top is exactly as described. it can be casual with jeans or dressed up for evening wear. i would have kept it but it was slightly tight across the chest. i am 5' 1 1/2" tall, 112 lbs & purchased a petite small. my bra size is a 34a.
4 This top is really pretty. the fabric is soft and flowy (not too boxy) and the elastic at the top is comfortable. it does not ride up or fall off the shoulders, which i've found with tops of similar design. in my regular size s (5'6 - 125lb), i didn't find the sleeves tight like others have mentioned. one thing i did notice was that the hidden straps that many other tops and dresses have (the ones for hanging on a hanger) are sewn right on the edge of the upper elastic making them pop up a bit.
4 I had been admiring this dress for over a year and finally treated myself to it for the holidays. first, it is gorgeous and very thoughtfully designed to make you look amazing. where things fall off the rails for me is the fabric choice for the sleeves...they are sooo delicate and evidently snag far too easily. the dress that i received in the mail had two large snags (one in each sleeve) that were already running a bit. to me that was a huge red flag that i shouldn't be spending so much money o
4 I saw this in the store and had to try it on. luckily i grabbed a couple sizes before heading to the dressing room since i thought it looked large but wanted to get the best look. i normally wear a large in most retailer items and if you want a really roomy look you could go for your normal size but i liked it a little more fitted and ended up getting a small. i plan to wear it over jeans or leggings. the delicate embroidery and details are so pretty. the stick out sides look a little funny but if
4 I love the cut of these pants! i'm very curvy and the high waist and wide leg is perfect for me. these hang off the hips beautifully. i'm 5'2" and the petite is perfect with heels. i didn't have to hem them. the one drawback is that they get very static clingy which is frustrating. i wear them with a cream tie blouse and wedges. they're really comfortable.
4 I wasn't sure i would like this top, but wanted something different, than what i already own. i ordered it in an xs (my usual size) and it is slightly loose (which i knew it would be based on the cut). it looks great with jeans or shorts. i purchased the black and white striped one because it looks more interesting. the ties may drive me crazy- we'll see. i like the weight of the fabric, i just hope it doesn't pill. for reference, i am 5'3 and 123lbs. i usually wear a 2/4.
4 I can't decide on these pants. after trying them on in the store, they are very soft and a beautiful blue color. however, i found them a bit small. i usually take a l in retailer pants, and these are very tight. probably could pull them off with a tunic top, however, in spite of the fabric, the fit was just not comfortable for me. a good alternative for denim if you are slender, rather than curvy.
1 I usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops, ordered this top in an s and it was so wide on the sides and huge it fit like a tent.  not even remotely flattering.  i thought about ordering it in an xs, however, i could tell the xs was still going to have way too much fabric.  back it goes.
4 This top is well made for the price! the colors are beautiful and will work well with jeans and a leather jacket if it is cooler.
4 Beautiful, unique design. it's very flattering the way the fabric hangs.i usually wear a 10, but because the lining is much smaller than the dress (which many linings are... it's a pet peeve of mine), i sized up to a 12 and took in the shoulders a couple inches so the bodice area would sit correctly on my bust. otherwise in the 10 my stomach would feel squeezed even if it looked like it fit perfectly. that said, i'm very sensitive to that kind of thing.other reviewers have noted that the emb
4 If you're very small-framed and/or petite, i would size down in this. unless you want a really slouchy look and fit. ----------i have very broad shoulders and very large biceps, and typically wear a m/l in retailer tops. sometimes if a top is a pullover style (as opposed to button-down) i have to size up to a 12 to get the top to accommodate my shoulder width and biceps. so i was leery the size 8/italian 44 would fit, but it does, with room to spare, albeit it is not as loose or long in the ar
4 Like the other reviewers experienced, i received my top in the mail, and it does not have the straps as shown in the online pictures. not to say that the top is not attractive, though, and i'll be keeping it. very comfortable and cool in the triple-digit heat in my community.
4 Cute cute. simple tank with a little something to add interest.
4 This is a gorgeous dress. the color is absolutely stunning and looks true to the photos online. the dress is a little too short and tight for a work dress, but too thick for a summer dress. it would be perfect for a date night, but since i have enough date dresses, and not that many dates...i opted not to purchase. it is gorgeous but i would suggest sizing up because i could barely zip in my standard size and the seams would definitely give after sitting.
4 I bought the pink, which is a vibrant but not neon shade of deep reddish pink. love it. i love how the flutter of the sleeves is balanced with a slimmer fitting body, which keeps it from looking frumpy. i did order a size down to achieve this look. i prefer a more tailored look so this suits me while satisfying my desire for a little whimsy now and then. my only issue is that it's too low cut. trying to decide if i just need to wear it with a lower-cut bra or if this requires a cami. i hate laye
4 These jeans are very unique thanks to the embroiding. would have perferred colorful embroiding though. they are boyfriend cut, but not slouchy. just a bit loose even around athletic legs. they run true to size, but have a lot of give. after wearing them for a a little bit i catch myself pulling them up a bit. if you want a snug fit and are between sized i would go down a size.
4 I love this tunic in the carbon color on the model. the color does look different in person, more of a lighter gray. on me, the tunic runs very large. i am usually a small or medium but took the extra small in this and still have room. i agree with the other reviewers about the pockets. they do add bulk in the hip area so if this is a problem area for you, i'd avoid this tunic. overall, it's a nice tunic for everyday wear. the tie-neck adds a nice detail and makes the tunic stand out. it looks g
4 Bought this on sale and wore it to work yesterday with black skinny pants and leopard flats with a big gold necklace. i'm busty and have to be careful with peplum styles, but this one does well.
4 I love this dress. i agree with the other reviewers that the rhinestone linkages do very easily get caught on the lace part of the dress and i could see it snagging very quickly. that said, i am going to keep it and hope for the best because it is absolutely gorgeous. it is not actually a true white as it looks pictured. instead we, it is more of a nude color, but it adds to the flattering nature of the dress and makes it look sheer. the embroidery is beautiful. my only complaint is that it will
4 I'm 5'3" and 110 lbs. i usually have a hard time finding pants or leggings that are short enough and fit just right. i ordered an xs, and these fit like a glove right away and i was so pleased! i ordered the brown and blue motif. i have only received the blue so far but love them. they hit just right at the ankle and aren't too loose at the bottom. it seems like they are made well but will wait until after the first wash. i'm someone that wears leggings all the time but love that these look like
4 I have still not decided if i am keeping this dress. i sized up according to the other reviews. i typically wear a 6, so i got an 8. it fit me just fine on top, but i am a 36b, so fairly small. because of the photos, i expected the dress to be a-line and flare out at the hips. it did not, that that's why i am unsure. i'd like it to flare out a little more than it does. it would be more flattering and more comfortable. i love the dress otherwise. i think i may take it to a tailor and see if there
4 Love the fit of this top, love the design. it does fit a bit small which was a pleasant surprise considering the sizes don't go as small as i usually have to. i got the smallest size and its pretty tight. its a revealing/low cut top, which is great for minimal tan lines. negative- threads are coming out all over after one wear. but i love it so much i will probably order again once it falls apart.. not so great considering the price though.
4 I waited so long for a small petite to come back in stock and finally it did...received the dress last week and it's beautiful it was a perfect fit for me not to big not too small (my size 5'3"/122lb). if you're petite or very thin probably size down. i gave it 4 stars because of the quality...some of the eyelets looked a little weathered. it is lined and there's no see through. agree with other reviewers though - this dress is not worth $228 price tag.
4 I wanted to comment about the wash. yes, these jeans look really ?dirty? when youpull them out of the package. but after a few months of washing, the dirty color has reallymellowed. also, i am a usual 26 in jeans, purchased these in 25 and could have fit into the 24. i may purchase another pair, these jeans are really unique, comfortable, great for the summer with sandals or converse.
1 This dress is so cute! i went to the store to try it on and although i knew the dress would fit i could not get the zipper up. my mom, the sales lady and i all tried to get the zipper up and it would not move past the ribbon. i wish i could have bought this dress but i can't without a working zipper. i tried a size up and every dress at the store that was my size and none of them worked. please fix the zipper problem so i can have this dress!
4 I couldn't agree more with that first review. i would add that it does run large.the leg holes are big. beautiful flower watercolor design as it shows in the picture. soft fabric and thin elastic waist band. no fake string tightener or buttons. simple and romantic. yet still a good sleep short to prance around the house in:)
1 I wanted this jacket to fit on me like in the photo, but i guess my frame was still to petite. the fabric was also on the cheap end
1 Was really excited for this dress and couldn't be more disappointed. doesn't look anything like the pictures.the fabric feels...cheap. it came wadded up in a ball and is a wrinkled mess. looking beyond that, i tried it on and thought i had put it on incorrectly. unfortunately not. the top half doesn't sit correctly. it's so bizarre that it seems like a flaw in the design. it doesn't sit on your shoulders, but doesn't look right off your shoulders. the neckline is very high. also, front b
4 This is a beautiful top.  the detail in the pattern of the fabric is gorgeous and the color goes great with jeans.  love the design of arm holes, they don't show your bra!  the only con is price, but it's a keeper.
4 I agree with other reviews, soft, cozy and love the embroidery and beading. it is a bit wrinkly even after i ironed it but overall happy with this blouse.
4 This is very cute, but i will have to size up my large to extra large. and normally i wear a medium or large. it is quite tight as a large. it looks a lot cuter on the model. so i am hoping the extra large does it.
1 I was so excited to purchase this dress; i love all shades of grey for winter clothing, i love knits, and i have loved other maeve dresses. however, i simply cannot fathom how poorly this is designed--it fits absolutely nothing like it appears to on the model, to the point that i wonder if i might have received a defective dress.for reference, i am 5'5", slender and small-boned but also curvy (hourglass). my bust is 36 c, hips about 37-38. i normally wear a small in maeve dresses. maybe it's j
1 This dress comes with a built in fupa. literally there is extra material at the lower abdomen that sticks out and is very unflattering.
1 I'll start by saying, over the years, i get more and more frustrated by the lowered quality of retailer's products. this dress represents all of my frustration. cheap, cheap cheap material. low thread count. elastic!!! around the end of the sleeves that rubs the cheap fabric against your arm. i mean, this dress is a total disaster - and looks nothing like the photograph shown.
4 I really like this romper and i ordered it to fit my bottom. i'm a 6 on the bottom and 4 up top. i ordered a mp to cover the bottom and a petite for my height. it's a keeper but i will be belting or adding something to cinch it at the waist so that it has more of a shape.
4 I love the coziness of this sweater. i do think it is designed for a looser fit, but i sized down for a closer fit. the sleeve design is unique and flattering i think, kind of of like a cap sleeve would be if you were wearing a long sleeve shirt under it. i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it does shed some, but has so many other positive features that i am keeping it and plan to wear it with lighter colors so i don't need to worry about it.just lovely really, love the blue color especially
4 I recently purchased the reading room cardigan in the color pink. the color is beautiful, and very flattering with my olive complexion. i ordered a medium, and although it's not a traditional fitted cardigan, the shape was very flattering, good length for my 5' 6" height, and is very versatile. great for transitional weather into spring.
4 I loved this top... the color is true to screen. the cut is cute. it's a lovely basic top that has just the right twist to it. i loved the fabric. it is see-through but if you wear a nude colored bra under it nothing shows.
4 This is a very comfortable, good-looking skirt. fits as shown. the zipper however is rather short, and it takes a bit of squirming to get it over the hips. once on, it's great.  it is not made in the usa, as stated. it is clearly marked "made in mexico" from "globally sourced" materials (i.e. not from the us).
1 I didn't have a problem anticipating the fit of this dress. i felt with the drawstrings on each side i could make it work. i usually take a large and even ordered a medium as i had read all the reviews of it running big. when i got the dress, i was beyond disappointed. it is a heavy, itchy polyester-like fabric, not a thin rayon looking texture like the picture shows. it is also a deep black, not the plum color in 4/5 photos. but most importantly, i am 5'8" and the dress is very short on me. it'
1 When i tried this top on, i started laughing. the two rows of ruffles are made of a starchy thick cotton, which, instead of falling by the hips, juts out like wings. it's also huge. cute idea, wrong material and placement.
4 The first reviewer summed up many of my thoughts exactly. i don't like to go without a bra and this dress with its slightly wider, almost cap-sleeve straps solves my problem perfectly. i love this neckline and wish i'd see it in more maxi dresses! the crossover and cutouts in the back mimic the lines of a traditional indian sari blouse and skirt, again without sacrificing bra coverage. just a beautiful and inspired design - definitely a standout in the sea of summer maxi dresses i've seen. i lov
1 I was disappointed with the style and quality of this dress. it poofs out funny in the waste and it just looks very unflattering. i'm sending it back.
4 I tried it on and it fit like a glove. it was a little strange having a different fabric on the back, but it worked and i am keeping it.
4 Bought this in cream in my usual xs/0, (5'7", 32b, 115lbs). it is a very flattering summer weight cardi which will work well with jeans and maxi dresses this summer. i would point out however that the sleeves are very snug - if you don't have thin arms then you may have to consider sizing up. i stuck with the xs even though i had to carefully pull the arms on because the s was just a little looser in the back. the sleeves are meant to be form fitting but i think they have been designed a little
4 Love the way this looked online/on model. would not recommend for a shorter or curvy person such as myself. it just ended up looking like a very chic potato sack on me, and was not flattering.
4 I need to remember that this brand runs small. i ordered the xxsp and i usually have a little room with jacket, but this fits snug. i have one from last year and it's the same. fits snug. if you want extra room, order a size up. the quality is nice, i love the camel brown color. it's a keeper for me, just won't be able to wear a sweater under it.
4 Sweater dresses are my fall/winter uniform and the patterns on this one are particularly unique and lovely. i'm 5'2'' with a small bust, this fit nicely and moves well, it's not baggy or bulky and not tight. good for work and play. i would usually wait to see if an item at this price goes on sale, but this one is the kind of piece that i expect to be snapped up swiftly and i don't regret getting it at full price.
1 I loved the photo of this dress. upon examination of the dress (and trying it on) after receiving in the mail, the dress shown online is nothing like the dress i received save for the pattern. the dress i received has a side zip as well as a belt and no pleats on the top. the bottom is also cut straight across not as it appears in the photo. turns out it is not as flattering as it should appear.
4 True to the verdugo style. love the fit, stretch but holds shape...super comfy!
4 Ditto on the oversized comments. am generally a large in tees and sized down to a petite large and probably could fit nicely in a petite medium. the stitching on the neck and front design are adorable. a bit long but great potential for layering to showcase the writing on the collar or cute design on the front.  think it's a keeper!
4 I ordered the blouse in black. it's not quite black but maybe in between a brownish gray. very pretty color. it fits just right. would have like it just a tad longer.
1 Ordered this vest on line and returned it due too poor quality .
4 Great fabric, details, construction...but, it is not grey!! definitely shades of brown!! i do like the look & style of this top.
4 I loved the cut out features on the shoulders of this shirt. it has the palest tone as pictured and will be cute with jeans this summer and on vacation. i took one star away because the body is cut rather large. i tested the center back fit and that was fine. i wish the body was a little more narrow.
4 This dress is super super pretty. it is very dull light blue grey, very romantic with the black blow. very very pretty, i love it! my only complaint is that it "balloons" up a bit due to the fabric. it is very fitted for me, i think if it were a tad loose fitting it would not balloon up around the curves as much. it is short and comes a little above the knees. i love this dress for it's romantic look, it can be paired with leggings as well.can't wait to wear it.
4 Great dress, nicely structured, but the fabric is very thick and since it's lined, it's a very "warm" dress. not something you would wear in the spring, especially in the summer. ordered in petite, so hem length was perfect on me (i'm 5').
1 The color is completely off! i loved the way this vest looks in the picture! i was excited to have that vest but unfortunately what i received in the mail was a huge disappointment. it came wrinkled and the brown is not as rich as it is in the picture. very pale. horrible.
4 I love this skirt; but it is so long that i have ordered the petite as well to see which one i will keep. i am tall; but even pulled up higher than my waist, there is at least 3 inches too much in length and i want to wear a flat shoe or boot with it. if i keep this one, it will need to be altered. it has pockets which i love. it is an effortless long skirt which i will wear christmas day for sure. the pattern is stunning with the mixed prints. the fabric is silky. it can be dressed down with a
4 Cute top & well constructed. was surprised at the various gatherings i hadn't noticed before ordering, really like the billowy aspect on the bottom. received lots of compliments.
4 I received many compliments on this top. it's very cute and versatile. a pair of jeans or a skirt or capris all can work well with this.
4 The longer back makes this one of my favorite pieces for fall. the navy blue pairs well with the floral accents on the back. this blouse is a little too sheer for my liking, but nothing a cami cannot fix.
4 I loved the look of these jeans-super cute-however they were way too tight! i ordered my usual size 31. they don't fit like a darker pair of serif jeans i own. back they go ! i'd be curious if anyone else found these to run smaller.
1 This is a cute top but i wore it for around 5 hours and lo and behold i had smurf skin. i did not sweat in it but the color transferred to my underarm area and bra and it did not come off in the shower!! i guess it's going to have to wear off. thank goodness it was not a hot day!! i hope that i can return it.
4 The large is perfect for me and is just my style - not too baggy but just shapely enough to where to the office with or without leggings, as the fall approaches. i bought the blue; the color is rich and saturated. the material is soft and all around comfortable, which is my number one factor in buying clothes. love its versatility too, since a jacket and scarf can dress it up. shoes also dress up or dress down the dress. all in all a bargain.
4 I am typically a 14-16 and the dress is true to size. (xl) i live that the embroidery runs the full length of the dress. i also like the shimmery side seam detail. the front cut near the shoulders is very flattering on. one minor issue is a gap in the bosom area due to button placement. however, i plan to add a snap t i fix. i often have this issue as i am large in that area. the length is flattering as well and provides great coverage in the rear. lightweight and flows nicely. the color is wond
4 Cute, easy to wear dress. personally i think it looks better with a belt, or something to accentuate the waist. otherwise it's a lot of fabric in the middle. i didn't think the top was too low as others have mentioned. though, it is possible to wear backwards (with a v neck front) if that bothered you. nice length, long enough for work.
4 Love the shirt! the green is such a vibrant color and it fits great!
4 Lovely, but i am sensitive to some fabrics and i couldn't bear the feel of this lace. wish it had worked, so pretty in the picture!
4 Super cute basic top but after washing it once according to tag instructions, it is pilling like a well-worn sweater would.
4 I got the grey in my normal size large and it fits as shown. love the cowl neck although it's a bit awkward and oversized. the cowl is a lighter shade of grey and a nice contrast. it felt a bit itchy and is a tad boxy and short. i decided to return.
4 These trousers are not lined. there is a wide elastic band that runs along the inside of these slacks that is not tacked down, which is a little cheap and probably to keep the price down but doesn't affect the overall fit. and they do fit nice. when your putting them on the fabric bunches at the crotch but then slims out after you zip them (zips up the back.) the fabric has some spandex in it but the lyocell makes them a great choice for work. they hit my ankle a bit lower than on the model. i'm
4 This tunic is very nice. flattering, good design, worn in winter and spring, and fits well. i have a curvy figure, and this fits well. i wish it came in more colors.it does show flaws slightly but fits well and is stretchy.
4 I'm a sucker for plaid. i tried another plaid shirtdress from retailer, and it looked like a housecoat on me. this is lovely - a bit fitted, but very relaxed and casual. i'll be able to dress it up for casual days at work. it's got enough lovely details to be stylish. i think the waist looks a bit simple, so a belt helps dress it up. the sleeves finish with a button, so it looks polished, or they can be rolled up. i love it with booties!
4 I loved the multi stripe pattern, buttons, pockets and a-line shape .  i agree it runs small. i sized up from my normal size 4 to size 6.  it sits at my belly button which i like.  i can tuck in a thin shirt comfortably.  the pockets kind of sag/pooch forward and don't lie straight through the course of the day but not enough to really bother me.  i  straighten the skirt by pulling up.  great buy on sale. i'm 5'2", 115#.
4 Cute top. not sure about the tassels at the sleeves. very flattering in the waist area.
4 Snagged this dress in store today. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because it is dry clean only although i will probably attempt to home wash. it runs very large. i am usually a medium but currently nursing a baby so need large to fit the chest but i bought this dress in a small. also, it can be elegantly worn backward so the zipper is in front to provide nirsing access. i don't think anyone but you would know you are wearing it backwards. very heavy fabric which makes it drape nicel
4 I wanted the blight yellow as photo with navy flower motifs. however it was much more darker as on the tag, mustard. if you like its color you will like it.
4 I was really suprised when i received this top. it was a knit (more like a t-shirt material), which i really like. this way you can wear casual as well as dressing it up. it is not see thru at all and it stay off the shoulder. the one thing i dont like is the elastic band at top is too wide. but overall ita s keeper!
4 This top looks better on than on the hanger. i've been looking for a feminine plaid top and this is the one! it's a flirty and innocent look in one. i would say size up. it runs a little tight around the upper arm, shoulders area when stretching arms out. i normally wear a size 2-4 depending on the top and the 6 felt better.
4 This shirt is versatile for work and fun. my sister has this shirt and thought it was so cute, i ordered it too.
4 This fabric is the same as the turtleneck swing dress by maeve. it's lightweight and stretchy. the problem with this particular dress is the pattern in the fabric will be a little different on each dress depending on how the pattern was cut when it was made. i had to try on 5 different dresses to find one that was cut so the pattern looked and fell in the right spots when wearing the dress. hence 4 stars. the bodice is lined but the skirt itself is not. it is not see through. i'm 5'4" and 120#.
4 Our store only had one petite dress in my size in stock. i'm 5'4" and so can sometimes pull of petite sizing. no in this case. it was a tunic on me. however the dress fit beautifully everywhere else and the quality was beautiful so i'll probably order my size in regular to give it a try.
4 I was looking for a coat to wear over dresses. this one is the perfect length and works over all lengths of dresses (and looks awesome with jeans too). my only concern is how it will hold up in the rain - it hasn't happened yet!
1 This fell apart after wearing it once. for the price, it should hold up better. it's too delicate.
1 I was very shocked to receive this dress with a rusty zipper, looks like crusty white rust . see attached pictures. the dress fabric is very nice and i did try it on and it is a very nice fit, lined with a little stretch but my gosh what a cheap poor quality zipper that looks like it was old and exposed to moisture because the metal parts have a white crusty substance! retailer you really need to check your merchandise before sending to your loyal customers. lately the quality has been declining a
4 This cardigan was a keeper for me. i love the pin that pulls the two sides together or worn open is just a nice decoration. four starts only because i felt like the arms ran a little short.
4 I always coveted a pair of flower camos that my sister used to wear. they were perfect, fitted, but not too, casual but not too. i saw these and thought to myself that i finally found them, that i didn't have to covet my sister's pants any more. these check all the boxes--comfy, stylish, high quality, but by the end of the day, they bag out. when i wore them, i had to keep pulling them up--a belt would certainly help. so, i love the pants, but am a bit disappointed with how they lose their shape
4 It's so hard to tell exactly what this sweatshirt looks like from the online photos. it has a white and pale sky blue tie dye look all over with a sea foam green floral print. runs tts. the floral print isn't centered on the one i received, but for $11 i'll be keeping it.
4 I'm so glad i saw this pretty dress on sale as my eye overlooked when it was introduced. i have to agree with the previous reviewer that the zipper on this adorable dress is yucky to grab and zip. i also wish there were pockets but it's not a deal breaker. perfect dress for autumn/winter especially with a thin layer to wear underneath as the armholes are cut a bit large, showing my side boob and bra. i had to go two sizes up because 10p was sold out. skirt profile looks a little too wide, so i'l
4 This romper was cute and short but not too short. the fabric is soft and elegant.
4 I wear a lot of solid dark colors for work so i liked this was dark blue but had more pop than the basic navy. able to pay it up with other colors too. the sides are a little shorter so have to watch throughout the day so belly isn't showing. not a bid deal overall.
4 Beautiful top for summer. love the yellow under the thin white fabric. the photo is good representation. running big.
4 Adorable, comfortable piece. runs slightly big.
4 This is a very pretty, delicate, comfortable dress. i think it fits tts - maybe even a little large. i got the ps which is my usual size and it fit perfectly.the only complaint i have is that the photo is misleading. on the dress i received there was nothing to hook the buttons into (no loops as in the photo) so the whole front of the dress has to be unbuttoned. i wish i was able to button 1 or 2 as in the photo.
4 This sweater looks alot better in person. the picture online doesn't do it justice. this can be used both as a sweater or even like a lightweight jacket. a very versatile piece added to the wardrobe. definitely worth the markdown price!only con, is that it has some fluffy pieces in the yarn that comes loose on wearing and sticks to other fabric. so wearing it with black pants might cause a problem.
4 I tried this on today because when i touched it, it was irresistibly soft. i like the orange, it was a loud orange-and i almost would have preferred some sort of design to it. i did not purchase this because at the end of the day it did not suit my style-it was very plain. i think you could dress it up with the addition of a belt or the right necklace, but i am not usually a fan of buying pieces that do not stand on their own and require an accessory. that said, it was very comfortable and soft
4 Love the colors in this autumn designed sweater that i just received but it has to be returned. i disagree with one of the reviews that it is not as pictured as far as the green being "off." i think it is just as pictured. i love the texture of the large pockets and belt with the suede feel. i love the flap on the back. what i don't like is how large it is. i have never worn an xs from retailer and i should have listened to the advice from the previous reviews but i didn't. i could send it back
4 I tried these on in a 6 which is my usual size in bottoms that are not designer jeans and they fit ok. they were a little short waisted but i have a long torso. sizing up to an 8 helped but then they were fairly wide in the legs. they are meant to flare out a bit i believe but it was too much for me. i like them but i don't love.
4 This is the softest shirt, super comfy, very baggy but i'd say true to size for the style. it is a bit thin and i'm worried how it will hold up, or would have given the full 5 stars. i'm not a usual fan of the turtle neck but this is so soft, i love it!
4 Echoing others' remarks, this top runs large/wide (wise to size down). the embroidery is beautiful and for the volume of work, this arrived with minimal to no loose threads. however, i was bit disappointed by the mixed cotton textures - most of the top is a knit, tshirt like textures, while the bottom hem (with the horizontal stripe embroidery) is a stiffer, thinner woven cotton that i had thought would be the material for the whole shirt. the mixtures of textures and predominant knit textile ma
1 This is an extremely flattering dress. i couldn't resist buying it, even though i didn't come into the store looking for a dressier dress, which i feel this is. once i tried it on, i had to purchase it. its one of those things that i know i won't regret because at some point, an occasion will show up that i'll wear it to. its soft, comfy and flowing and accentuates the body's curves without being too tight or clingy. its a classic!
4 This cardigan is nice and the lace at the back is pretty. just be aware that it's definitely a cropped length, which is good for wearing over a dress that you don't want to cover up too much. size up if you want room to layer. the one i tried on at the store had the top button almost falling off, so i didn't buy it.
4 Love! accurate sizing feminine details my new favorite top
4 I tried on the blue in store and ordered the red in petite, and they are both too long (which means i will have to hem). i am not sure if i want to spend the extra money on hemming so hanging on to them for now as i love hte cut and color. they fit like a glove otherwise (i do have muscular thighs). the 0p is good for me (115 lbs). can't go wrong for a nice pant, i can see wearing these out or for work...
4 I was excited to find this on sale because i just love baily 44, their designs are always simple, beautiful, and comfortable, and this one, just like the other 2 baily 44 dresses i own is perfect. i am 5'9, 125 pounds, and 34b bra size and got my usual size, xs. unlike my other baily 44 dresses, this one has a more relaxed fit up top and then has a form fitting layer that shows off your curves on the bottom. i personally don't think it's too short, but then again plan to wear tights with this pi
4 Beautiful and stylish. looks amazing with my new black suede over the knee boots! i am 4-6 on top and curvy 6-8 on bottom so aline skirt is great (interior slip is tight straight skirt rather than a-line, which dropped one star).
4 The sweater coat would be wonderful for cooler weather this fall. i ordered it in medium because the small sizes were sold out. sometimes a medium is the right size depending on the brand. i was disappointed that the coat was so large; i don't think it will work for me even with layers underneath. it's a great design but i may have to return it.
4 Nice, easy to wear dress!
4 These are really great legging style cords. you can wear them without worrying about covering your bum in my opinion! they are not too bulky at all which you might expect in a corduroy pant. they are a tad loose in the waist area unfortunately but fit me well in the thighs, so i don't think sizing down would work for me. i bought the bronze, and it's a very versatile color! darker than the picture, but still a good color. i feel it will be perfect for fall and spring especially. i'll wear it all
4 I'm 5'0 and 114 pounds and got the small petite. i have broad shoulders and am slim hipped. i no longer have a waistline, thanks to having given birth, but this dress really hid that. it gave me a figure! the ruching is super flattering and the material has enough support (with stretch!) to hide any unsightly rolls.so why did i return it? i did, after all, get many compliments from females while trying it on. they loved the color on my pale olive complexion (i'm filipino with -ahem- blond hair
4 I am generally a size l, and after reading reviews, sized down. the inner layer was a little snug, but this was not an issue because of the outer layer. great dress!
4 Love the pattern & fabric. it does run a little large. i usually take a medium or large but with this dress, i may have even taken a small. it is somewhat drapey, which i like, but that needs to be considered when sizing for it. i'm hoping it shrinks a tad so the dress has a bit more shape. i'd exchange it, but i love the pattern & quirky sleeves so much i want to keep it! got this gem on sale & can't wait to wear it in the spring & summer months next year (or maybe on a warm vacation)...
4 I love this top! i was hesitant about purchasing based on the other reviews but i'm so happy i decided to order this beautiful top! i'm 5'4" 115lbs and the xs fits great. it does run a lititle big but i like slightly over-sized tops with skinny jeans. the xxs probably would have worked as well. i definitely reccomend giving this top a try but size down if you are going for a more fitted look. the lace detail give this staple piece a nice added detail!
4 The top runs small, it is a very sexy and slimming top. i tried in l, it was too small so i have ordered it in xl. i hope it fits because it is very fitted and i am worried that the bottom will roll to the top with a fabric like this. but it is a very sexy, good looking, and slimming top. i love it!!
4 Great top for everyday wear. runs a little large as i usually for size medium and i bought a small. a tiny bit see through but i think i can get away without wearing a tank underneath.
4 I ordered the green version in size xl. i knew it was cropped and it fits me as shown on the models. so, i think that's true to size. the knit is very soft. but, it's the color that's amazing--such a rich bright emerald green! i love the look of it. it's awkward fitting on my pear-shape. i layer a long tank underneath with this on top. but, the hemline of the sweater cuts at an unflattering place. still, the softness and the beautiful color make it a staple in my closet. when i'm staying at home
4 This dress runs waaaay small. i would have too size up at least 2 sizes. while it is a beautiful color, it is an extremely stiff dress. returning!
4 Goes well with lots of skirts and pants, including the culottes shown. only downside, and not a big one, the sleeves are finished with elastic instead of a fabric band, which looks a little cheap
4 Comfy cozy!
4 I am 26 weeks pregnant and bought this in an xs to wear to my shower this weekend. i am delighted with how it looks on, but it really might be too big for someone who isn't pregnant.
4 This is a really nice top, especially for the price. i am 5'6", 34dd, 140 lbs and normally wear a medium in dolan tops. in this top i purchased size small since the gathered front provides ample room for my bust. some reviewers have found this top to be on the "boxy" side. i can see that if you don't size down as i did. i found the medium to have too much fabric and look very baggy whereas the small was perfect. i do wish this top was a tad bit longer and less sheer, though. white tops should be
4 I love rompers and this one is really cute. i usually wear size 12 but should have got a 10, it runs big. it seems too long, and i'm 5'9". the prints cute but a little blah. i paid $158 which is too much, since i haven't worn it yet, i should have waited for it to go on sale.
4 I like this raincoat but it runs large. exchanging for a smaller size.
4 This dress is gorgeous in the photograph. and very pretty when it arrived, however, it is very dark in color. you would only notice the blue in bright light or perhaps outside in the sun. the fit was small. i could not get the tie around the waist to look right and feel comfortable, so sadly i had to return it. i applaud retailer for the excellent and attractive packaging. that was almost enough to sell the dress. it came in a very nice white box inside a larger box. tissue paper and fol
4 I am a 34dd so i purchased the small in green, hoping for a more fitted silhouette. i got what i wanted and it looked great overall. except for the chest. it just sort of mashed my chest down in a very unflattering way. but despite all that i almost kept the coat because it was so soft and warm and beautiful. and sturdy! i could have sized up for a better fit in the chest but then it would have been boxy and we hourglass shaped ladies know how poorly that works out. wish this would have worked b
4 I bought this top in my usual xs size in black and it fit just right. it's very flattering and i love the strip of buttons down the back and the tucks at the shoulders. two things that i did not (could not!) notice by looking online is that this top is actually knitwear! it's still very lightweight and it has a fabric strip that runs along the back strip of buttons. the second thing is that it's a bit transparent. i would definitely prefer to wear a camisole underneath if i'm wearing this top to
4 I have this top in orange and white. it is a great top to throw on with jeans. don't put it in the dryer, will shrink.
1 I should have listened to the previous review on-line before ordering. unfortunately this will go back as the design fit and proportions are simply off. i love uniquely shaped wraps like this, but this one didn't make the cut for me.
4 The dress is beautiful but runs small so unfortunately i have to return it.
4 This dress is really cute, but it runs quite large. order a size smaller! i got a lot of compliments on it at the party i wore it to. it can be dressed up or can be casual with a pair of sandles.
4 Feminine flow, however slightly large. such soft material. love the little details.
4 This is a nice lightweight summer top to wear with a pair of shorts. it is low cut though - lower than i expected so i wear a tank underneath it. the layers are flattering.
4 The colour is gorgeous but it's basically a baby doll dress - it looks like the waist is much lower on the model but for my height and large chest it' fell like a baby doll or a maternity dress. not flattering. pockets are a nice touch though.
4 Love this shirt, it's so comfy for fall/ winter, but has the really cute detail at the top. love the color too!
4 Runs really large. i am 5'4", 120lbs, 32c, and had to exchange xs for xxs for width, but then the sleeves were a little tight. decided to keep the xxs in white.
4 I purchased in store to avoid shipping costs. my local stores don't carry xxs, so they are mailing it to me. i usually wear an xs, but it was roomier than i cared for and made it look a bit sloppy on me. this tee is more distressed looking in person than online, as well. i wish it were more refined because the neckline is very feminine & interesting; i would have liked the ability to dress it up more. also, the solid blue and coral are lighter in color than they appear on my monitor. the blue st
4 My size was not available so based on reviews stating the bagginess of a certain area, i sized down and glad i did. i never size down because i do not like tight clothing, especially casual wear. nice muted print and good quality terry material. recommend, but size down if you want a more fitted feel.
4 Cute bright colored suit a little more orange than pink i prefer pink but the fit didn't quite work for me  the bottoms were a little too big and the top although was fairly well proportioned just didn't look right altogether  purchase the extra smalls in both  and have since returned  i do love the suits that retailer has been offering would just love to be able to try them on in the store nice quality good colors
4 I love how this sweater fits. i was reluctant to get it because i thought it would be boxy, but it's a perfect length, especially for a higher waisted pants or jeans. the fabric is super soft. i only gave it four stars because i thought it was going to be grey, but it's more like a marled black/white, 80s-style color.
4 These are so soft and cute and i could see myself wearing them a lot. however, my normal 25 was just too baggy and the few times i tried to wear them around the house, they just bagged out and all i did was pull them up every 2 seconds. i ordered the black, mostly because i wasn't crazy about any of the other colors. if there were any colors left in a 24 that i could see myself wearing, i would re order them in a smaller size and see if they were any better for me. i think if they fit you well a
4 I usually wear a small or medium depending on the cut, but this one only worked in a large. with or without a bra, it was not too low and covers all the middle area flaws beautifully. bust size average and i have muscular (not sticks) arms and a fairly wide back. nice and drapey, pretty green color. great sale price.
4 I love the feel of the fabric and design of this dress.  i look forward to changing the look with cowboy boots or fringed booties. i also like the option of wearing it opened over a white tee and jeans. worn loose or belted, it can be different every time you wear it. it does run large so you may want to size down.
4 This dress is more lovely in person than in the picture. the lace details show beautifully against its nude slip. i'm 5'1" 130# and regular size 2 fits perfectly and hits at my knees. it's a very flattering dressy-casual dress. it's a bit pricey for a cotton dress but worth it at the 20% retailer promo.
4 I bought this during the 20% off and i'm glad i did. the sweater does run large, so i would recommend sizing down. i'm 5'4, 135 lbs, with a larger bust (34d) and even the size small is large on me (not large enough to exchange, but i would probably do better with an xs; even with an xs i would still get that oversized look). the color is not exactly as pictured, it is a brighter yellow in person. i was expecting more of a muted, soft, baby yellow, and that's not exactly what this is. some pros a
1 Ordered on line and thought these are a great quality as i pulled them out of the box. tried them on and found minimal elastic for the waist. within minutes of wearing, the waist fell down past my hips...glad i was at home. looks cute but will not stay up.
4 This is a cute top and i did not even need my usual petite size thanks to the 3/4 length sleeves. i liked the semi-abstract sailboat pattern and the style is comfortable to wear. however, the tie at the neckline didn't appeal to me so ultimately i did not buy it.
4 Ordered online, just received this vest, so disappointed! love the garment but it is way too small. i wear a medium in most clothing and size 6 in a dress, but the medium in this vest isn't just snug it is definitely too small, even worn alone, i can't button it. i am now ordering the large and keeping my fingers crossed as i want to wear a tee under it. hoping i won't need to return both the m and the l, thinking of ordering an xl.
4 Bought this dress as good transition piece into our hot fall. don't usually go for the uneven hemline. but got so many compliments, i'm expanding my comfort zone.
1 I was excited to see these jeans since they came in petite sizes and had a short inseam... unfortunately after ordering/returning several pairs, i found out that these are actually not petite jeans. please beware that if you are ordering these for the shorter inseam, they are actually 28 in... not 24 in as in the description. other than the inseam issues, they fit like typical paige denim.
4 The top itself is beautiful and colors are like pictured. my only issue was the size. i went for medium ( i'm usually m or l) and i'm 5'4" so i can get away with regular and pettite. this top was way too long. looked like dress on me. i'm sending it back for exchange
1 I tried this on at my local store. i love the look and the color of the blue tank and wanted very much to like it. alas, it was not to be. the material is super thin (almost see-through) and it is of poor quality. i did not buy it.
4 Tried it on in store and found it cute and comfortable, it might run a little big since i was expecting to fit into small but found the xs fit and looked better. i will consider when on sale. i felt that it was way over priced.however if money is no issue i would buy it.
4 It is a pretty tank, the fabric feels nice and substantial.
4 -i normally don't go for these tops because with my hourglass frame and wider hips, it only makes me look wider. however, like others, i was drawn to the fabric and feel.the bottom half really is lovely and looks expensive, and the top half is stretchy an
4 I ordered it with a particular outfit in mind as i liked the purple (burgundy) color. ordered xxsp, as with most t-shirts at retailer, they run a little big. xxs seems to be my new xs (which used to be s!).color was nice , fit was good too, i just felt not "special" enough... but if you are looking for a tshirt, then i say give it a try, as it was comfortable and the shape at least is unusual.for reference, 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist
4 I got this in light green and it's a gorgeous color. first tried a small, but it was a little too wide and long. exchanged for xs, looks great. now i just hope it doesn't shrink too much!
1 I agree with the other reviewers, this top is completely disappointing in every way, i could not believe it was the same top i pulled from the bag. where to begin,.......it runs really bigit's short and boxy, not at all like it appears on the model, this must be pinned a lot in this picture.colors are completely dull in person, i really think this picture was lightened a great deal.fabric feels cheap and stifflining is stuff and poorly sewn.i haven't one positive thing to say about t
4 This dress is lovely. the colors seem a bit more muted than as reflected on model; otherwise, looks very similar to photo. it has a slimline style and is very flattering. the dress has a more casual appearance than as is reflected in the photo. its really more of a day dress than a special occasion dress, notwithstanding another reviewer's opinion to the contrary.i ordered up a size due to reading other reviews. i found it to be a bit larger than i wanted so i washed and tumble dried it on low
4 This is an interesting skirt. the fabric is comfortable, breathable and flowy. it is eye-catching. but the pattern is not one i would say i love, although i do like it. the lighter color in the pattern is more pink than off-white, which is fine, but that did surprise me a little. overall, i kept it for comfort and because i liked it enough for the sale price i paid for it.
4 This dress is cute and the a line style is quite flattering. a few minor issues: fabric is linen not denim as the name states, petite sizing is still a little large and back zipper doesn't zip down far enough to step into so has to be pulled over head (not that big of a deal). for reference i'm 5'4, 120, 32d and i ordered a petite size 4 and it was a bit large and fell bellow my knees. will be returning for a size 2. fingers crossed!
4 I had to keep rechecking the price tag on this one to be sure i saw it correctly. price aside though, it's really awesome. fit is flattering, stripes are cute, colors are nice, and you can wear it all summer long. if you can get over the dollar signs, it's a keeper!
4 I bought this dress in black and i think it will be a great piece to transition with but definitely great during summer. doesn't come down too low on me which is sometimes an issue. the arm holes seem to be on the larger side. i'm 5'3 so it is not this short on me. i'm really happy with this purchase. plus it has pockets!
4 I spend a lot of time on the retailer website. it never occurred to me to try this dress. a salesperson suggested it in the store and i tried it on. it is really cute on. i bought a thrift store denim jacket to throw over it. the only con is the sleeves. i am 5'3' and my arms are not very long. the bell sleeves are a little crazy on me, but they will be hidden under the jacket.
4 This dress is a beautiful cut, and thankfully, it comes in petite so it fit my frame. i ordered it in my usual size in both 2r and 2p and will be returning the r. checks are cute and can be dressed up for work or for social event depending on goal. fabric is a little scratchy but texture and cut are great.
4 I love this fabric, it is comfortable and forgiving. as i prefer jewel tone colors and the red is beautiful. i thought the sleeve length on this might be odd, but it's fabulous. the only reason i haven't given it five stars is that i haven't laundered it enough to verify the quality
4 I really like this shirt. i almost didn't order it based on the other reviews, but its cute and comfortable! i didn't get the white color, so that may be why mine is not see through. i just wear it with a bra and its good to go!
4 I ordered this dress to possibly wear to my wedding rehearsal dinner. i an adding this review to give some guidance on sizing. i am size 34a and own two other dresses by this designer in size 2. for this dress, however, i had to size up to a 4 in order to close the side zip. i'm 5'7" and the dress hit me just above the knee. (in my opinion, it would have been more elegant if it was a little longer.) the color combo with the taupe and off white is unique, but wasn't particularly flattering on my
4 I like the skirt. that said it is going to the tailor to have some of the fullness taken out. just a lot of material going on, and heavier than you might have imagined. i will wear it fall & winter with white & navy cardigans.
4 I am 5'2" and got this in a 6p. i would say it fits tts (the top also has some give), but the waist is just a few inches away from being empire. i think the dress on the model is pulled down to de-emphasize this. even so, it is a very cute dress - plan to wear it with a navy velvet jacket for easter.
4 This is just the cutest dress on. i love the way the plaid comes together in the seams and the fullness of the skirt. i almost didn't order it, but then i left something in my cart too long and it was gone. this was my next choice. i haven't had the chance to wear it yet. but the wrinkles pressed out beautifully and it is hanging in my closet waiting for an event. i will wear it without a bra since even with my strapless, the bra shows in the front. i think if you want to wear a bra it would be
4 This is a great swingy tank for summer and the smocking adds a nice design element to an otherwise plain white top. i typically wear a l, sometimes xl in tops from retailer, but the l in this is pretty loose - i am hoping it will shrink down quite a bit in the wash. otherwise i really love the top, and now that it's on sale, the price is definitely right! i wish the black one was still available!
4 This is a cute, casual romper but i'm on the fence about keeping it. i hate when there is a pattern mismatch - especially across the butt and that's why i'm on the fence. i bought my usual xs/0, (5'7", 115lbs, 32b). i would say that it is a little roomy around the bust - if i keep it i might have to have it altered slightly to stop my bra from showing. this is the first jumpsuit that i have tried that actually accommodates my longer torso - so many seem to ride up and that is not flattering!wi
1 This dress will unfortunately be returned...so cute online and looks like a sack in person.  runs very large, arm holes are very low.  not flattering.
4 I was so excited for this to come in the mail, once i got it and opened it up i actually went back to verify this was in fact pajamas! it is great quality and super soft! some positives were that it has pockets! (who knew?!) and like stated before it is super soft and comfortable. the only negative is that it is not physically attractive, it is very baggy and it a-lines out. it's fine its pajamas but if you are wanting something cute for bed and you have a straight body this may not be the answe
4 I purchased this top on sale and it's almost perfect. the pleats under the rib cage make the bottom bell out a little bit - not enough to make me want to return it, but i'm glad i didn't pay full price!
4 My waist measures 28" and the size 4 is a snug fit. i normally buy size 2 in retailer skirts, but the 2 was unbearably tight. cute skirt though! i like that it's machine washable, and the quality looks good.
4 This is a beautifu;l dress. unfortunately it runs extremely large. i wear sized 10-12 and ordered l. i was lost in all the material. but because i love this dress so much, i am taking a chance and ordered it in small.
4 I ordered this top in xs and blue, its subtle but pretty on, as the style gives it a boost. it is a bit snug in the shoulders (cut a little snug in armpit?) but i would not want it larger. it does not affect the appearance, is not uncomfortable, just noticeable when moving arms around. nice fall top, want to try with blue or white jeans and boots.
4 I took this sweater on a recent vacation up north. i wore it 3 evenings because the weather changed from hot to cool. loved the feel of being wrapped in a warm blanket. cocoon cardigan is an apt name. wasn't sure about pink but it is exactly as pictured. this will become a go-to in my sweater wardrobe.
4 1. i'm 5'5" tall, 145 lbs, and 38-32-40. i wear a size 30 in hyphen chinos and they are loose. i could get in a size 10, but i felt the stretchiness made it look like it was pulling slightly. i decided to get the size 12 even though it was a hair loose.2. the skirt hem is right above my knees. it's not as short as it appears on the model.3. the back pockets are sewn shut, so they won't sag.4. my only complaint is that the hook and eye at the waist pulls away funny, but i'm going to t
1 Totally bummed. the pretty print doesn't outweigh the very odd fit of this dress. makes you look really top heavy and even the print, which looks so cute online, looks muddled in person. sadly, went right back.
4 I had high hopes for this cool top. i ordered it in xxs because no petites were available at the time, and i think the size is just right (i'm +/- 105 lbs, 34aa). i just suspect it looks better on people with broad shoulders, like the models'; mine are kind of narrow. plus, crew necks aren't the most flattering neckline on me. i would say it's fairly short, just barely covering my belt, so on taller people it may be cropped, and the waist is kind of fitted, as shown. i love that it's cotton, mad
1 I was looking for a casual dress for quick errands that was trendy but comfy.  this dress had a lot of potential [i was drawn to the print]  but the material is awful. so thin and scratchy! immediately went back.
4 The weight of this denim is perfect, thin enough for a nice drape and wearability for all seasons but still thick enough to be structured. though there is absolutely no stretch, which is probably why so many are finding it to run small. i am a true size 6, but find that most retailer brands run quite large, therefore i usually wear a 4 and that's what i purchased in this dress. the bodice is a bit snug, but not enough to size up, for me personally. i know it's mostly a spring/summer dress,
4 I purchased this jacket in red. i have several boiled wool jackets from retailer and this one did not disappoint. it is very warm and appears to be high quality. it looks good both snapped and open. i do believe that it runs large. i settled on an xxs petite and am just under 5'4".
4 Very cute. a size small worked perfectly for me, fits like a glove. it has open sides so i wear a tank top under it.
4 This top is made from a thick, sweatshirt-type fabric, making it a nice choice for transitional weather. the details are quite unusual and lovely. i just got it and i've already worn it twice.
4 This is a great pullover. very cute for lounging at home or running errands. it does run large, i ordered an xs & it's pretty big. for reference, i'm 5'7'', 125 lbs & 34 b. it is also a little pricey for lounge wear but i am keeping it because it is so cute.
4 I love the feminine feel and look of this skirt. it is unique and matches many different shirts and looks great with a jacket. the only thing is it does run large. i ordered a 6 (my usual size) and it is very loose, not form fitting like the photo, but still cute and wearable. downsizing would've been better.
4 I really did want to love these jeans but i had to return them. im a size 10 and a little heavier in the thighs and got a 30. the rise is just to high for me and the thigh was very tight. the denim felt fabulous they just fit me a bit funky.
4 I tried this on in-store and would have purchased if it have been a better price, it wasn't something i could justify spending $100 bucks on. it's cute and was surprisingly comfortable but again, not worth the asking price. i will buy when it goes on sale.
4 I bought this dress for an early fall wedding, i usually wear a size 14 and bought a large. it was loose and swingy, very comfortable, almost too big. i would size down if you are in between. this dress was so easy to wear, i would definitely bring it on vacation. you can pair any type of shoes- flats, sandals, heels, wedges would all look good.
4 A cute dress. i did not have the issue with the slip being too tight. i wish it had a little more shape to it. while flowy, it looks a tiny bit tent-like. i still like it and wear it into fall with booties and boots!
4 The top is really pretty. it is sheer and needs a camisole. wish the material was a little softer. think it fits true to size.
4 This sweater is a grand-dad style sweater. i love the pattern of the fabric. it does run a bit large, especially in the length of the sleeves. it definitely fits a more "oversized" sort of look. i find it very comfortable & perfect for a casual/weekend outfit.
4 Cute top, wish they had xxs. looks great with jeans and a fun necklace like pix. i got an xs (5'4 and 135 lbs) and it's still a little wider than i would prefer, but i'm not a skinny jeans gal so might look better with those. i decided to keep it since no xxs. wore all day with jeans for a more casual event, then added a skirt and high heels later for a theater show. super comfortable and looks great for all occasions.
4 I cannot believe this t-shirt is on sale! the colors and the design are beautiful and soft. the shirt is an average t-shirt weight, and the fit is nice and loose on the body like it is on the models. i am 5'3" with a petite/athletic build and the xs fits comfortably (with some room...washing may make it even more perfect). i cannot wait to wear this with jeans on the weekends or with a grey skirt to work.
4 I really like this shirt overall. i'm 5'2 and the petite sizes were sold out so i bought a regular. if you are short like me, beware that the sleeves am be almost comically long. while the shirt is stretchy, the cuffs are not so pushing the sleeves up isn't really an option. also, it had lots of loose, hanging threads straight out of the package. but overall, it's a keeper!
4 I was shopping for a holiday outfit today at my retailer store, and my sales associate suggested i try on this top. i have lo idea where it was on the store l, yet it's a very pretty top that stands out when you have it on. i took this in a small because it's meant to run shorter. i felt xs would have been too small. i purchased it to wear with jeans or dress pants. pretty detail. blouse shows off my arms and minimizes my waist. i love it!
4 I really love the feel of the fabric on this dress. when you first take it from the package it resembles a tent, but once you figure out how to scrunch the front and back around the straps, it resembles the photo. the fabric is very soft and the indigo colors are amazing. this dress is perfect over a swimsuit or for casual gatherings. you can even dress it up with a belt. it is somewhat sheer, but does look cute with a cropped jacked over it.
4 These pants run large than the true size. it is so comfortable and can be dress up or dressed down.
4 This dress is so vibrant in person. i am 5'10" and the length is perfect. having a small waist helps too. certainly worth the $49 i spent on it. watch the sales. several times ill go to pay for an item, and its even cheaper that advertised. the uniqueness that retailer embodies is what i love the most about their clothing. i'm a size 10, ordered a medium
4 This is a very cute dress that i did not keep. mainly because i did not like the neckline on me. if it had been different i probably would have kept it. i liked the fabric, the top is a little thin, but i did not think it was sheer. the bottom part is sheer, but there is a lining. it drapes beautifully. it is a little like a maternity dress, but not enough to dissuade me.
4 I love this shirt for a throw on and go.  hangs nicely and fits great.  colors are more vibrant in person.  i love mauve, i think they do a great job with their designs!
4 Received this blouse to wear for the holidays and was not disappointed. the design of the shirt is to be relaxed and flowing. i usually wear a medium which is what i ordered. the shirt fit fine but i probably could of managed with a small if i did not want it as relaxed. so if you are between sizes, you might want to size down. if i did order a small, the sleeves might of been a tad short since i have longer arms. the shirt is sheer, so you will need a cami underneath. i wore a black one which w
1 I tried on and bought this shirt in my usual size and it fit long and loose but still had great shape. after hand washing in cold water and air drying, as per instructions on the tag, the shirt shrunk significantly. so much so that my stomach shows if i raise my arms at all. it also lost its shape, and now looks very boxy and is very unflattering. i won't be wearing it and am disappointed i didn't even get to wear it once!
1 The dress is beautiful in pictures, but all the reviews are dead on...it was full of snags when it arrived! 8 snags to be exact. and the fabric was heavier than i expected. sadly, had to return.
4 I bought these in the store today. they're a great jean. none of the pairs i saw had as much distressing as the picture. there were no holes, which i'm actually grateful for, i don't like holes in jeans. anyway these had a great fit for me. they fit more like a slim straight jean on my curvier figure and really flatter my backside- they aren't baggy, as pictured on the model. they're a great casual jean which i know will be my new staple! (even better- my husband gave them a big thumbs up!)
4 I liked this coat but my family said it looked too much like something hilary clinton would wear. i am 54 and i think it made me look a bit dowdy since it runs a bit big.
4 Bought these in 28 had to return for a 27p . love them!! i order the 2 other colors
4 I love this coat! it is exactly what i was looking for. it is unlined (with cute fabric edging on the seams) and a lightweight wool but it is roomy enough for layering and that is what i like about it. also like the length as it can conceal a long tunic sweater without it hanging out the bottom. it is very versatile in that it can be worn with something dressy or jeans and leggings. also like that i can add any fun scarf to dress it up or down. it's a great contemporary shape. i would say this c
4 I love these cords! soft and great fit. bought three colors!
4 I couldn't resist the toucan print when i saw this online, and ordered in my normal size s (27/4 in pants, 34b bust, 5'7"). the fit is perfect - arm holes are an appropriate size (not huge like some dresses), semi-fitted and flattering, nice length for work, and the tie front is a nice detail to help define the waist. length is about the same as the model shot. i knocked off a star for quality since the fabric is not particularly breathable for summer and the zipper is a little tough in the wais
4 This a great dress! bright colors, soft material and comfortable! the body of the dress is voluminous, so i found it to be a definite swing dress. i can see why it sold out the first time it was offered!
4 This dress has a much more flattering fit than appears! it has curves and fits tts. the fabric is fairly heavy, nice quality polyester and will be just the right weight for a nocal wedding. the back straps nicely cover foundations so even though it's open you don't need special undergarments. the color in the pic is spot on. don't be deceived by the "turquoise" moniker.
1 Noticed all the 5 star reviews online for the latest pilcro stets- so due to the past 2 years of dissapointment of what was once a great pair of jeans....i was hopeful that retailerpologist listened and went back to the original pilcro stet formula- thick denim, just the right amount of give and a flattering 10 inch rise. walked right in and found them- and i knew right when i touched them- they were still the thin denim that's nowhere near the quality they once were. consumers pay attention and t
4 I bought the blue & black, they are great basics. got the small. i am normally a extra small in retailer.
1 The fabric is a little stiff, the back looks unusually long compared to the front, and it fits tight across the chest. and i'm not busty so that's not a factor.
4 A very cute and comfy top that's lightweight and falls nicely... but, it does snag very easily. so far, i've worn this top once and found small snags in multiple areas. the snags might blend into the fabric texture if they did not create dark spots. the yarn/thread is a mixture of a celadon tone and black, which concentrates the black when snagged.
4 Cute top and perfect for those hot summer days as fabric is light, but not sheer.
4 These run tiny. i wear a 25/26 in pants and took a medium in this bottom and i'm still not completely comfortable with the fit. love the floral print, but with a bottom this small you don't really see much of the flowers so on mine at least it's just some splashes of different dark colors.
4 Love the feminine take on flannel and how it fits like a tailored shirt. i am a bit long waisted and the side slit reveals a little too much when i lift my arms. if the shirt was just a little longer it would be perfect.
4 I was so excited to order this dress; however, once it arrived, i realized that the fit doesn't work for me. i carry my weight in my stomach and backside, and the dress clung to my trouble areas.
4 Very soft, comfortable piece that can be worn casually with jeans and a tee or over a blouse or sheath dress for work. i like the 3/4 length sleeves and pockets
4 Bought this for my daughter. it's adorable on her. we're going to take it in at the waist so it doesn't look so sack-like; then it'll be perfect!
1 I do not even know where to begin with this product. i ordered a small (i go between small and medium) and felt that would be a good fit. after trying on the shirt, i would have opted for the xxxxxxxxs or whatever the smallest size is. this shirt is very boxy. i know its supposed to have a 'flow' to it, but this shirt is too much. it needs to be taken in. or have a belt wrapped around it. i tried the belt look but it did not look flattering. i found this color to be very blah. overall, i am slig
1 I loved them on when i got them, but they literally frayed apart on my body as i wore them, and i had them on no more than 5 times. it was not a fit issue or a seam issue; they literally just frayed apart in two areas.  while flattering and incredibly comfortable, the fabric was not at all durable...they are not your typical  denim,  they almost kind of a knit feel them.
4 This blouse is great to wear almost anytime! it can easily be dressed up or down depending on the occasion and the accessories. it has a bit more volume around the waist then the picture shows - but that could be because i'm bit more "well endowed" than the model. i'm 5'0 and size m/8. this shape looks great on my curves without making me look chunky or stout. the image makes the color look black, but in person the color can pass for a really dark blue in some light. the textile of the fabric is
4 I got this number in the turquoise and i hadn't expected the skirt to be ribbed! are they all like that? retailer was out of the petites, so i sized down in a regular instead -- yeah, that didn't work. i definitely needed the petite version and perhaps should have even sized up. the bust was scandelously tight. in the end the dress wasn't flattering on my figure the way this style usually is on me -- the proportions were off somehow. it's just not one of those dresses that curvy petite girls shoul
4 Found this lovely dress in store and wanted to try it on. fits true to size everywhere except the bust. i am a size 2-4 with a 34dd bust. i can normally fit most retailer dresses no problem though. this one was very very very tight just in the bust and squished my chest to be a very unflattering shape.i am 5'4 and the length was perfect just above the knee, for a youthful but work appropriate length.i am a relatively fit but hourglass curvy lady, but certainly not a 'perfect' beach body and
1 This is a great dress if you don't want to leave the house or you want the world to see your nipples.
4 Beware ladies! these are the first pair of cartonnier pants i've tried that actually run large! i have several other pair of cartonnier crops that are sized way up to a 10 (my normal size is 6 or 8). to my surprise, my normal size 6 in these for perfectly!! the fabric is way different than the printed crops. i got the bright red, and fabric is stretchy! great fit and great weight for summer!
1 I was able to get this on sale. when it arrived, it was missing half of the rhinestones. i am very surprised that this top would be sent out this way. it also was missing the little bag with extra stones. i'm reaching out and wondering if anyone else has experienced this and is there a store that sells rhinestones like the one on the blouse? any help from anyone would be appreciated. i hate to part with this, but where was quality control?
4 This dress has a flattering and fitted cut which perfectly compliments the unique eyelet fabric. it is at once elegant yet casual, perfect for the office or better yet, afternoon tea in a far flung british colony of yesteryear. which brings me to the buttons - putting on this dress makes one wish one had a ladies maid, but the effort is well worth it for this stunner of a dress. as others have said, it runs small and tight in the chest and is not for the well endowed. i am a petite 5'2" and fit
4 I ordered this dress online and did not realize it had beaded details on the bodice... gorgeous dress - perfect for festival season.
4 I do not know if this item is worth the full price but i love it. very soft, good length, and comfortable to wear. the stripes are a perfect width so as not to be overpowering. the fabric design is unique and i think the weave added to the cost of production. for many it may not be worth the cost but i am glad i purchased this top. it is not a sheer fabric. try it on if you see it in the store.
4 I was excited to get these pants & at a great price! i am 5'9 & these pants were plenty long enough for me. they also have a nice light textured design that's hard to notice in pictures. the only problem was they are a side zip pant which i didn't know when ordering. i don't love the zip on the side for my shape it. so i'm still wondering if i'll keep them. other than that nice pant!
4 This is a find! i am always on the hunt for a unusual lbd so when i found this on a "found and collected rack" i went for it. for starters, i am 5 foot almost 6 inches, and it the length ends just about the same place on this model. i usually wear a size 2 but when i tried on the size available in the store (oo), i felt i only needed a bit higher sizing bc i am small in the chest. i am barely a size 34 a and probably a 30d at best, and i barely can squeeze my chest into this dress at this size!
4 My favorite features of this sweater are the flattering neckline and the bracelet length sleeves. it's a heavy-weight cotton with a beautiful line. my only complaint is that it seems to pick up lint and things very easily and needed a lint roller even straight out of the delivery box. still, a small issue for an easy to wear sweater that looks great with jeans and boots as well as leggings. a new favorite!
1 This top really is lovely. i had high hopes of it looking smashing with black jeans. i wash everything before i wear it. though this garment says it needs to be dry cleaned, there was nothing so delicate about the fabric that it had to be dry cleaned. so i hand washed it with delicate soap. when the lighter colors came into contact with the black, the black immediately stained the light color. i tried putting some stain remover on the black stains, rinsed and hung it above my bath tub. it is cur
4 This dress is exactly what i was looking for for fall events. can be dressed up or down, flowy, suede-like fabric. i normally wear a small in most retailer pieces and even though i am pregnant in my first trimester i bought a small in this since it is stretchy and will fit me at different stages.
4 This dress is too short for me to wear as a dress, at 5'7" and over 40. however is is great with leggings and boots.it drapes nicely not over sized like many dresses this style. the color is more earthy than pictured. it's actually nicer in person than online. and it has a wonderful texture to it. i was drawn to it when i walked in the store they had it on display under s short cropped jacket and boots.
4 Had to return for a larger size. like the design, though. quality wasn't as expected but since i purchased on sale, i decided not to return the top but exchange for a larger size which i hope is still available.
4 Runs large under arms i am typically a size medium but bought size small.
1 Super itchy! had to return.
4 Love the pattern on this lightweight cardigan and it is super flattering. i tried ordering the xs/s first because the next size up just sounded too big, but i ultimately had to order up for more room in shoulders and length in arms, though. i'm hoping the m/l fits without too much spare fabric because it really is a great piece.
4 I had purchased other sanctuary black petite leggings in the store and found these on -line. they are very flattering and well-made. runs a little small, i am 5'0 and 97 lbs; small fit more loosely which i prefer so i can wear them to work. thanks retailer for carrying great petite selection!
4 I only say that this sleep top runs small because it shrinks a whole size after you wash it. i'd recommend that you order up a size for that reason. otherwise it is cute. i am ordering the shorts to go with it.
4 I really love this dress, just not on me! i am very curvy, with a rounder stomach. i normally wear a 10 (5'8, 160lbs), and the 10 fit, but it is so fitted that i didn't like how it showed everything. if i had a flatter stomach, i would have kept it, but it just doesn't work on my body style unless i wanted to constantly be pulling it down (it was riding up a bit). the fabric is great, the color and pattern are so lovely i almost ignored my instinct and kept it anyway (my boyfriend, who is picky,
4 The photos don't do the top justice. the split back is very unique and adorable. i typically take a size 8 in tops, but ordered a 12 since a reviewer suggested it was narrow in the shoulders. the 12 shoulder fit perfectly, but the body is way too big -- i was swimming it in. i like it enough that i'm going to visit the tailor to take in the body. with the sale price, it is worth tailoring.
1 I am not sure who would look good in this dress. it is extremely oversized with tons of fabric that will not flatter anyone!
4 I love this dress, i love the style, i love the pattern, i love the feel of the fabric. there's a slight puffiness to the shoulders that surprised and delighted me. however, i think it runs a little large, particularly because it's not fitted at all - that tie around the waist is the only defining feature, and it's a great one: this dress (and your figure) needs it. i am 135 pounds, 5'5", and i normally wear a 6. perhaps i should've known to try a small, but i went with my usual size in dresses
4 I ordered the ivory in size xl. it fit a little on the small side. the knit was good quality as was the lace. unfortunately, the mock neck was stiff and uncomfortable. the sleeves were a little too long for me as well so i returned it. but, it's such a unique style and good quality.
4 I fell in love with this jumpsuit at first sight. the color is stunning and very striking. i found it to run a bit large, so would suggest sizing down for optimal fit, but all in all a great piece for summer that will transition nicely into early fall.
4 Just as described by others. soft, great fabric and so comfy.
4 The red is so pretty in-person. i love the details on the sleeves... only complaint is the fit is pretty boxy and couldn't size down because it is borderline to short in length. did buy it today and we will see if it work out!!
4 I bought the black motif, the design lends to a nice pop of color.  the venting detail on the back is beautiful, but probably not as obvious on the black.  maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers.  i'm usually between a s/m or 6/8 in blouses.  i followed advice from other reviewers and got the 8- for room in the arms.  the blouse is very billowy- much more than in the photos, but i'm wearing it with skinny jeans and i love it!
1 Large and the material is too bulky. i returned it.
4 Love this top! i just purchased this shirt from my local retailer store. i noticed it when i walked in and saw it on display. it's stylish, comfortable, and subtle. it runs large so size down. normally, i wear a medium in retailer tops but needed a small. the flower print is small and the colors are muted against the black. pairs well with several colors: black (like model), dark denim, olive green, and mauve. the display had it tucked into a soft khaki colored pair of pants that worked as well.
4 I love pilcros! i have a few pairs and all in 28s, so that's what i ordered, however they are so tight i could even button them! i haven't gained any weight and all my old pairs fit fine... i liked the color and length so much i'm exchanging them for 29s. hopefully that will do the trick!
1 As another reviewer noted, the upper portion (back, chest, shoulders, etc.) fit nicely. however, the body of the dress was enormous and did, indeed, make me look much heavier throughout the middle. back to the store it goes.
4 I ordered this coat online without trying it on in person. the pictures on the models are stunning. i have a long, mostly rectangular physique with long legs and a little extra love around the middle. i like wearing long sweaters and drapey things that accentuate the positive. i thought this was right up my alley. but, it person it has a weird bunchiness around my middle due to the hidden pockets. the sleeves are a bit too long and the lapels and shoulders make me look beefier than i am up top.
4 I bought this to wear to work, but i pictured it as being fancier than it is. the fabric is heavy, stiff sweatshirt material. i bought a small but probably would have been better off with an xs. despite this, it's long enough to be a dress on me, and it is comfortable and cute. it will be nice in the winter and could probably be dressed up some.
1 This sweater is a dull off white color. it looks old fashioned. don't get.
4 I just got these and had to return them as they were not becoming on my physique. for reference, i'm5' 5"; 122 lbs; 26" waist; 38"hips and i have a long torso and short legs. i ordered a 29 petite. the fitwas tight, but they are supposed to fit tight. if i wasn't so "hippy" i would have kept them. the model isslender with long legs and she looks fantastic in them. not me. i do recommend these as they are cute, but perhaps geared for a more slender body type.
4 I loved this top, but had to return because the stiff applique made me look like a linebacker! i wish it could have worked out, because this is a cool top. if this particular design works for you, go for it!
4 I agree with the other reviewer that the color isn't as pink in person and more subtle. my thoughts below on some other things:__________pros:- pockets! makes it so fun and chic with the overall style.- the material is lovely and breathable. i didn't find it sheer at all! of course, i didn't wear it outside the dressing room. the material is thicker but it hangs on the body well.- runs "mostly" tts. i only tried on the medium and it fit everywhere being slightly tighter in the chest. i
4 I really love the look and feel of this top, perhaps this was mentioned in previous reviews, but it is unlined, which i hadn't realized when i ordered it. so the eyelet details are will expose skin unless you wear a cami underneath.
4 Very pretty top, but like the other reviewers said?the neck is very itchy. i live in florida and i don't think i can wear this during the summer unless i get the neck lined. i got an xxs p which was a little shorter than i would have liked, so i am returning for xxs.
4 This is a nice and comfortable shirt. i'm 5'7 and i have triple d size bra and i got my shirt in size m. it fits perfectly and my breasts are not showing too big and the shirt is not too tight. it's more of a casual style, possibly because of the fabric that was made of. nothing fancy but a very nice every-day shirt to go with skinny jeans or a skirt. it covers belly really well and it does look nice and slim around the waist. i'm pretty pleased with my purchase.
4 I love the style of this jumpsuit. it is so much more interesting than a long dress. i am 5' 7" and need a few inches hemmed which will cut off some of the pretty embroidery at the bottom. my biggest regret with this is that it is not made from better fabric. it is a little stiff and scratchy. if it were more silky it would be a dream. but i am happy to have this in my closet. i purchased this in the berry red.
4 Super soft and colors are great. i got the navy and plan to wear with white jeans and platforms, similar to the photo. would also look great with black skinny pants. worth it for the sale price.
4 I am normally a size medium or small at retailer (depending on the bust) and could not even get the medium in this top past my neck. it runs very small. unfortunately the size large was not in stock for me to try. truthfully, i might have needed the xl in this - it runs that small. for reference, i am 5'6", 145 lbs, 34dd. also, the beading on the top i tried was coming loose and some was already missing. seems to be a common fault based on what other reviewers have said.
1 I wore this blazer for one day, didn't do anything strenuous, and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back, next to the center seam. it's completely unfixable, since it's not the seam that split but the fabric itself. what a waste of money.as to the fit, it is a boxy cut through the waist. it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned. the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it, so it's good over something cute.or, it would be, if it didn't fall apart.
4 I really love this dress and want to buy it, but i won't buy it in white. it is just too easy to get dirty. i would love a pretty blue or even a darker yellow.
4 I thought the dress in store for true to size and was a bit more 'swinging' style. i am 5'7, athletic and the small fit perfect.
4 This dress is super sweet, but also unique with the reversed fabric on the skirt. it is true to size, unlike a lot of retailer clothes that seem to be boxy/run big. the fabric bunches a little bit at the waist though -- that's my only complaint.
4 Really cute version of a sweatshirt. fits true to size through the shoulders and bust line; however, since i am larger in the bust area than the hip, the lower half of the top looks slightly large on my body. the sweatshirt is cut very straight, so it would probably flatter a person with a pear or straight shape. the inside material of the sweatshirt is a little rough; however, the appliquã© design makes this shirt a keeper.
4 Although this shirt runs a little large, the snowflske and stripes makes it a classic. very comfortable shirt.
1 I really wanted to love the shorts.  when i read that the shorts were lined, i expected them to be lined so that my underwear didn't show.  even though the shorts are lined, you can see through the fabric completely.  this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design; pockets; and, comfortable waistline.  i'm returning the shorts as well.
4 Overall great romper! i have a long torso and thicker legs so i sized up to a small and i am very happy i did. the shorts are a bit on the shorter side and go upon the sides so another reason to consider sizing up. the quality is great and super soft chambray with a trendy tie up.
4 I purchased this when it was on sale and it is a great, comfortable, and forgiving top. this top again runs a bit large, so i ordered a size down and it fits great. i think that they are off a bit on their description of the color. i ordered ?pink? but i would consider it more of an orangish red color. not my favorite but not terrible either. overall it is a great shirt.
4 If all the tops i ordered from retailer this summer, this top is my fav. it is a crowd pleaser! my friend called it my "art shirt." the fabric is nice and the cut hangs nice on my 5 ft 5 170 pound frame. the armholes are a little big, so i just wear a red bra with it and it's great.
4 The color and the fabric in these shorts is quite nice as is the length. i didn't order the pilcro bermudas because another reviewer said the legs were quite wide. unfortunately, these shorts also have wide legs. i'm going to have them tailored so they hug the legs as in the picture rather than billowing out. i do not have skinny thighs(don't i wish!) and i was surprised that the fit was not as pictured. if you're ok with wide legs or can get them at a price at which you're ok spending extra for
1 This dress had so much potential. the top was absolutely gorgeous. my issue was with the bottom half of the dress. the bottom is made from a heavy quilted material that is stiff and has no movement at all. the dress is supposed to fit like a modified mermaid dress where its more fitted around the hips and flares out, the dress i received had so much material on the bottom that it actually made my hips look bigger. i though about having the dress altered but decided to return instead.
4 I tried the green one on in the store, as my store only had the green. the lace was sort of fuzzy-looking and i couldn't tell if the items were shop-worn or if the lace was supposed to look like that. since they all looked that way, i decided it was the look of the original fabric and i tried it on. i do like the combination of the lace sleeves and v-neck. a bit dressy but casual also. although i sometimes appreciate a little forgiveness in the tummy area, in this case the design was too loose a
4 Overall i really like this dress. the color is vibrant & unique. the top of the dress especially the shoulder straps seem loose so i'm getting it tailored.
4 This top is a very comfortable, very easy top to wear. it is perfect for laying with work clothes or styling a bit more casually for just wearing out and about. i ordered it in the light blue color and it is beautiful- very soft and feminine. the ruffle lays really well down the front, which i was concerned about because of how busty i am. i ordered a small and it fits just right. i think the knit back really helps with that. very nice!
4 Super soft, cozy cardigan! i have a long torso and this is just the right length to cover my behind! i wish retailer would carry more sweaters with this shape. the sweater is soft and light - perfect for every day and you could wear it year round, although with its lighter weight, it might not be as perfect for winter. i purchased this in the kelly green color and it's gorgeous. i have it on right now!
4 I really love this tee! but, the fit can be boxy so i ordered it online in a size 0 and am very happy with how it fits me. i've worn it with skinny jeans and have gotten complimented repeatedly.
4 Beautifully fitting. simple and flattering. i am an athletic size 8/10. the 10 fits well but the straps may have to be taken in a little.
4 This skirt fits great. the thick material helps it lay nicely and smooth the curves. i'm 5-4" about 130lbs, athletic build with a bottom and the med fit well.
4 This top is really pretty and flattering. i bought my usual size and its loose and flows without being too boxy. the pattern is beautiful and the band on the top stays up well.
4 Great material. a bit loose in the middle / lower half. doesn't belt well. it could be 3" shorter, considering alterations. i'm 5'7" the model is 5'10", so yeah 3" shorter would be cute!
4 It's navy and red--the photo looked black to me. so i couldn't use with black skirt that i had planned to pair it with, but it's cute with jeans and maybe white shorts next summer. the front gapes open when you sit down, so i'll either have to pin it or sew a snap there unless i want the world to see my bra. also a little short waited for me--i'm 5"11", so i wish the wrap hit a little lower, but not enough that i didn't keep it. it is flattering blouse. the shoulder ties add a little extra flair
1 I'm 5 ft 7 125 lbs true size 4 and these pants made me look like i had boy parts. super disappointed!
1 I wanted this dress so much, i ordered it twice. both times the zipper was defective--it would get stuck midway up, at the waistline--so i had to send it back (there isn't an retailer in my area). this is a shame because it's got great colors and looks flattering on, and i was looking forward to pairing it with a cardigan/boots for fall. i even thought about taking it to a seamstress to have the zipper replaced, but the cost didn't seem worth it. too bad, as it seems like it would be a nice
4 Light and distinctive design. the fabric seems somehow synthetic and in very warm weather might become not so fresh
4 I tried on the red xs in the store and the v-neck was way too low. showed at least an inch of my bra strap in the back, which was unfortunate because i really loved the dress otherwise. i decided to purchase the xxs online hoping the v would not be so deep and would cover my bra. it did, but the xxs was significantly smaller! it still fit, but took this from an elegantly flowy and loose dress to one that looked more empire cut and tight in the chest. maybe the xs i tried in the store was just st
4 This dress is beautiful and unique. an eye-catching piece with a bohemian flare. you will not be disappointed. tts.
4 Height: 5'2"weight: 118-120 lbsbust: 34b or 32cwaist: 27"-28"hips: 37"-38"i like this dress a lot, but it would have required tailoring the skirt. i'm petite, but for whatever reason most regular sized clothing fit me well, and petites clothes are usually too short in the arms or legs for me. the midi length is better suited to taller women. in the photo it looks like it hits just below the model's knee, but on me it hit below the fullest part of my calf.i ordered the 0 and the 2
4 Although true to size, i sized up to improve pocket placement and for a longer and slouchier fit like on the model. the pockets in my regular size were almost too high up and made my midsection look bunchy.
4 Nice shirt that's a little different from the typical. flirty sleeves that move in the wind which is a great look :)
1 This dress looks lovely on the model, but it looks just awful on me!i am 5'4" and curvy. the shoulders are cut w/ a weird shape. instead of a cap sleeve, it is like a pointy cap on the side and stuck out on my shoulders. it looks like i am ready to get beamed into space.the material is nice and the sequins are pretty, but the cut of the dress is unflattering.
4 Love this shirt, but beware that it shrinks if you place it in the dryer. the good news is my teen daughter loves it, too, and benefited from my mistake. i usually wear a s or size 6 and bought this in a medium the second time around to allow for dryer.
4 I bought both the small and the medium and seem to be right in between. the small is a tad tight through the shoulders and arms, but the medium feels a bit baggy. it is soft and hangs nicely - i just need to figure out if i will wear it enough to justify the price.
4 I usually wear a medium in jackets, took a chance with the small in this coat. it fits well, the arms are a bit snug but not too snug. beautiful design though. biggest disappointment was quality. i thought the jacket would be thick and warm. it's pretty thin, will test out warmth soon. overall decent purchase, would buy again.
4 I loved the print on this top in navy from the picture, and loved it even more in person. it is gorgeous, and the top feels high quality. that said, as usual with maeve clothing it fit me strangely. i am curvy with a small upper body (34 d) but larger bust, and maeve tops are almost always too tight in the bust and too flowy around the middle , which creates a pregnant look on me at least. i feel their fit model must be small busted, so for small busted ladies this top would be lovely. i always
4 Beautiful skirt but does run small. i wear a small and am able to keep the skirt but have to be very careful about under garments since it is so tight. looks great though.
4 I like the retro look but these seem to run large to me.  i get they are ruched on the sides.  yet, the bottom has a saggy look.  i got the large but i feel like i should have gotten the medium to fill out the bottom. i already took the strip out and washed so i'm keeping them.  very cute with a bikini top.  maybe i just need a bigger butt.
4 As soon as i saw this blouse in the store, i fell in love with it. i thought it was a little too expensive for what it was, but, hey, that's antho for you. i luckily had a gift card and a 15% off bday promo, so i got it at a good discount. i love the fit of it. sometimes button-down tops like this are too tight in the arms or pulls too much around the chest, and this one doesn't. when i do wear it, i have to be conscious of the buttons because it can be a little gappy in between the buttons when
4 I decided to give these trousers a try, despite my reservations about the appropriateness of the flowered embroidery on the fabric, given my age. girls and younger women can wear these types of pattern in public, but not me. for me, it seems too much like pajama wear, so wearing them as house clothing also didn't appeal to me. i'll be returning them.the length is why i took off one star. how many petites have a 31" inseam? i would need to have them hemmed. if you're looking for loose fitting,
1 I love the colors. however, $200 is a lot to pay for a small piece of fabric , no lining what so ever. the fabric is very thin. you will need a slip. looks just like a cover-up. going back.
4 I love this unique piece. it is slightly over sized which is intended - cinches allow you to tighten the waist area/providing more definition. will look great with booties in the fall.. great boho dress.. the included slip runs small and short. however, if it's a piece you love, you could easily wear a different slip if you wanted something a little longer.
4 I took these out of the package and wanted them to fit so badly, but i could tell before i put them on that they wouldn't. these are for an hour-glass figure. i am more straight up and down. the waist was way too small for my body shape and even if i sized up, i could tell they would still be tight in the waist and too roomy in the hips - for me. that said, they are really nice. sturdy, linen-like fabric, pretty color, well made. i hope they make someone very happy!
4 The fit and style of this dress are beautiful. it's a bouncy fabric that is light and comfortable. i really wanted to love it, but the color just didn't work for me. the pictures make it look like it's a nice cream color, but it's very tan and i can't pull it off with my coloring.
4 I tried this tunic at a store and loved it. i had to buy a much bigger size because the sleeves are so narrow.the 12 fit ok but the sleeves are so tight it hurt. i have normal arms and i am so glad i was at a store to try a bigger size.
4 Comfortable and warm. i will wear this a lot this winter.
4 I have been staring at these shorts since they first appeared and finally decided to treat myself to them for my birthday. when they came in the mail i was so excited and they in person are even more beautiful and well made then in the picture. but be warned these shorts are rather short so if you don't mind showing a bit of leg these will be right up your alley.
4 I love this tank top...the fringe on the bottom is fun, and i've gotten many compliments on it already...i think it runs true to size :-)
4 I love these, but i should have ordered the size 25 instead of my usual 26. i can wear them higher with a tight belt, but they are still too long. too cute to return though.
4 I bought this top in both colors. the fit is perfect, the styling is very cute and it also is very comfortable!!the only bad thing is that it snags on my jewelry !! :(. if it weren't for that i would rate it a 5!!
4 This dress is very comfortable and casual, but in a high quality fabric that makes it great for a summer dinner with dressy sandals. i don't think a bra can be worn with it which i don't mind at all but might be a problem for others.
4 This dress is beautiful. it has lovely colors that should compliment many skin types. i bought the dress for my daughter as a graduation gift. i have not given it to her yet so i don't know if it fits or how it fits.
1 This dress looks like it could be cute on but when you put it on its just blah. i saw someone else trying it on in the fitting room and she felt the same. not cute, not flattering, the model photo is deceiving. would not recommend, although it looks airy and comfy.
4 I like this shirt and think its very feminine.
4 Like the look of this tank, ran a bit larger than expected at the neck but overall happy with the purchase
4 I love the print of this dress; the deep blue really is striking. i agree with the other reviewers that it has no lining and therefore, it's hard to justify the price. i can't seem to part with it yet due to the lovely print and the off the shoulder style is romantic and flattering. still on the fence. . . it would be better as a sale piece.
4 I'm glad i bought this dress with a discount. it's a comfortable staple, but not a showstopper. i love the plush fabric, which has great weight, and the skirt. the top is cut to be a little revealing, which worked well with my full bust but wouldn't be work appropriate. the keyhole at the back is large, but did not reveal my bra.
4 I think these look great. i found them on the sale rack and at $50 w/ 40% off, it's a pretty great deal. i plan on wearing with low heels. hope they work out. i will show to boyfriend, get his feedback too.
1 Luckily i bought this on sale... i now see the instructions online say to hand wash, but i bought mine in the store. the instructions on the tag said to wash delicate in cold water and tumble dry. i washed it in cold water and it shrunk to doll size.
4 The melon color is soft and flattering. it is a little on the long side in the back, but i paired it with a lightweight, flowy sweater, and received compliments.
4 Very soft, comfy, lightweight sweater. perfect for layering as the weather gets cooler. looks great with jeans or jean shorts.
4 I really like this skirt - so colorful! the interesting pattern and multiple colors will make this a great fall skirt. i can wear it with pink, burgundy, gray, white, black, and probably many more. can't wait for the temps to drop!
4 I loved the idea of these pants as i've been looking for an updated pair of tuxedo pants. i wear 26 in most of my jeans. i'm not super skinny & consider my legs medium (not too skinny & not too athletic). i tried these on in xs (36 european as marked on them) & they were big around the waist & hip area. there was so much gap in the back which made them look frumpy! i did however liked the length. the fabric is nice & heavy which i also loved. sadly, these didn't work for me though. really wish t
4 Lovely crochet lace tunic. also very comfortable. doesn't wrinkle and the cotton has a lovely feel.
4 I adore this dress. it has a fairly thick material, which helps the skirt stay full and is very flattering if, like me, your thighs or tummy can be a problem area in dresses! the only downside for me is the fact that i have fairly narrow shoulders, so the seam for the sleeves tends to stick out a bit! i get lots of compliments on this one!
4 I love these. i like that they're fancier than your basic summer shorts but they still look casual and effortless. unlike the other reviews i found that they run large. i'm usually a 4, maybe a 6, and the 4 is roomy.  still looks good though just rides a bit lower on my hips.
1 These pants are gorgeous when you first see them. they fit beautifully when you first put them on. and then you wear them for one day. and they snag. on everything. and little strings start to come out of the pants. and the hem begins to unravel. and the pants which were once beautiful light summer pants appropriate for work or brunch are now frumpy, worn out pants with a million snags and strings hanging off of them .... after one day. i can't begin to tell you how annoyed i am that i spent
4 Another lovely, billowy top. i tried on the xsp and the bottom was just huge. and i have a huge bottom - haha! it flowed out so far in the back that it looked silly. it's too bad, because from the waist up, it looks great!
4 Purchased the xs blue. love the fit and light material. perfect casual tee for warm weather. no shrinkage after washing in cold water and minimal wrinkles when hung immediately.
1 I ordered a size smaller prr other reviewers but that still didn't prepare me for the sweater's issues. it looks really cute but the quality is pretty horrendous. i wore it for the first time today and already the sweater is pilling a lot on my back. seriously heartbroken.
4 Great swimsuit, love the fabric and pattern. the top lacks support.
4 This top is so much prettier on. you can dress it up or down. it does run a tad large. i'm 5'7" and 145 lbs. i am usually in between a small and medium but usually a medium. i went for the small on this and i loved the fit of it. still pretty flowy and the medium would have been just too big. it is a tunic so it runs kind of long. a tiny bit too long for me but i will still wear it a lot.
4 This top is perfectly feminine. the fabric is light and the bow adds that perfect touch of distinction.
1 This jacket is just too small for me anyway and i am no way big. i am tall and athletic and this thing looked like it had shrunk in the wash. there are so many better fitting other types out there, this went back
4 I got this shirt in light blue. i absolutely love it. i just bought it for the summer and i wore it on a day where it was 85 and it was just perfect. it is a very light material and it's very flowy so it breathes very well. i got an xs. i am 5'6 and it fits just perfectly. highly recommend!
4 I ordered this in the neutral motif and the colors and design are more beautiful in person. unfortunately, there were no "petites" available when i ordered so i will have to have the length and slit tailored.
4 Liked everything about these but they should say in the description that they're ribbed.
4 I love this dress but the zipper is definitely defective.its a flatering style and i love the fabric and fit. im normally a 10 but the 8 fit perfectly. i'm nervous to wear it because of the zipper. i would return it but dont have the receipt.
4 I love the asymmetrical style of this dress - so unique. also the cotton blend is appreciated in a sea of polyester. the body of the dress hangs nicely and is flattering to the figure. but it didn't quite work for me due to the sleeves- they are narrow and not stretchy enough to be comfortable. sizing up may have helped, but because i am also short (5'1"), the sleeves were also too long for me. i wish it came in petite length. if so, i could probably just go up a size to make the sleeves more co
4 I think these are a cute pant. they run large in the waist/seat area but not in the length. i'm 5'4 and this gathered at my ankle. i like them even though i have to keep hoisting them up. keep in mind the tie to tighten the waist does not stay
4 The only critique i have of this is that the zipper gets stuck at the waistband every time i try to zip it up (even when it's not on me - just trying to hang it up) the fabric is strange but really cool, and the fit is nice, although a little tiny bit big on me. i am 5'5" with a 27" waist and i got a size 2. the pockets are awesome!
1 I am 5 6' and 130 pounds and ordered this in an xs. the sweater is enormous. the material is also scratchy and not soft at all. i'm disappointed with retailer's sizing this year. i've had to return a # of xs items because they are huge. really disappointing.
4 I really love this addition to my wardrobe. the colors are great and it is very comfortable. my only complaint is that it runs large. it would be nice if they had more than two sizes.
4 It is a beautiful dress,but didn't fit me.this is better for someone tall and thin.
4 I really liked this top-- the red gingham is adorable, and it looked great tucked into the pencil skirt i was also trying on. sadly, it had two things going against it:- when i didn't tuck it in, it looked like i was hiding an early pregnancy (it just hangs from the chest, and my bust is relatively large-- 34dd)- the material is awfully thin, and i don't know how it would hold up (that's a concern when you're spending $90 on a "casual" top)i would certainly consider purchasing this on sale
4 Fits loose good material. will buy in other colors.
4 I have been watching this skirt and only scooped it up on sale plus promo. it runs small and the size 10 fits like a size 8 would fit . 145 lbs and curvy figure, flat tummy but have hips and tush. the quality is just ok and not worth the full price but on sale it was doable. i love a-line styles and this skirt is different with the fabric stitching at diagonal pieces. it is light weight so i can really see this being worn more in spring and summer and a go to skirt that looks sharp . website pho
1 This is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer, but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear. this brand makes some of the softest, cutest tees, but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry. not worth the cost.
1 I feel in love with this piece. the color are gorgeous and i received so many compliments. it lifted my mood just wearing it! sadly, ut the end of the first wear i had a run up the front and by the middle of the second wear the light fabric got caught on something and a hole developed. upon further inspection i found another hole at the top where the price tag must have been attached. i also noticed all over pilling after the first wear! so sad! they should recreate this in a heavy fabric.
4 I bought this dress with my birthday coupon, i love the design of the fabric, and i think the length is great. it's a lightweight dress, which makes it a nice for more seasons. sandals in the summer, light sweater in the spring/fall, and tights, slip, and heavy sweater in the winter. the underarms wrinkled a lot the first time i wore it, which makes sense because i was wearing a sweater. the rest of the dress did not wrinkle at all. very satisfied!
4 I love his cardigan! i knew the small would be a little big since i am normally an xs or xxs. i decided to give it a try anyway. it's definitely a little big - i would have liked an xs to be an option (5'3" and 110lbs, for reference). i'm keeping it because it still looks cute, just a little loose through the body.
4 I'm happy with this sweater! a few things that may help others: 1) the detail on the yoke is made from a silky taupe-colored fiber, 2) it is ivory, not white and 3) although the fit is true to size, the sweater runs short, so if you prefer a longer fit you may want to size up.
4 I'm typically a 27. this 27 seems snug but there isn't a 28 in petite so i'm keeping these 27 petites. i ordered 27 regular also and they are too long. i'm 5'4" 128lbs. they are very comfortable. hope they stretch just a tad.
4 This top runs large... an entire size. i am on the fence about it.. it is quite *stylish* and well made. it is fairly heavy and seems like it would be very warm. the burgundy color is nice. the issue i am having with it is the way the lower black arms are sewn in the upper arms. it just seems somewhat *odd*. overall though, it is very *forgiving*,especially with the black border around the entire bottom. it is the perfect top to showcase a great long necklace and it would be great with leggings
4 Love everything about this beautiful coat except the way it fits on me.  it is just perfect in the shoulders but once it flares out at the bottom, i look like a clown costume.  if i size down it will not fit in my shoulders.  perhaps a tailor can install buckles that match the neckline buckle to the sides of the coat to fold in the flare.  on another note the buckle at the neckline feels very hard and fake, not sure if it's real leather.
4 The dress is very comfortable but runs a little big. i normally wear a 4/s and the small fits but doesn't have great shape. i'll keep it and wear with flip flops casually but was hoping it could transition out too. it's just not as fitted as it would need to be
4 This dress is stunning.  it may be my new favorite thing!  i'm not sure where you are to wear this as it is really fancy but i will wear it to work and church anyways--even if it is a bit on the dressed up side.  the fit it true to size.  i am 5'8 and the length is similar to that on the model in the photo. zipper troubles!  i can zip it off of my body--but when one when it comes to the thicker part where the zipper is i cannot zip it--decided could zip halfway and still shimmy in.
4 I tried the other dresses by this brand and they were short and didn't fit well. but this dress fit better,i bought the orange size 8 and it fit good with a swing to the bottom. for reference i am 5''9 , 34dd and thin and this fit well with some room. this time they got the slip right and its not tight and the length hits right above the knee which give an overall better look plus the long sleeve balances out the dress. i'm going to wear mine with tall brown boots.
4 This skirt is stretchy and really comfortable. i love the color. the only complain is it gives a little magnification to the low belly- on me at least. very flattering for the behind though.
4 I actually found this blouse to be quite nice. i'm not sure that i'd wear it as a tunic, though. it looks great tucked in and the print is fun but nothing exhilarating. for the price, i expected more.
4 I tried this product in store in red and fell in love with the fit, it fits in the most beautiful flattering way, red looked gorgeous - rich glossy fabric, this could easily be one of those effortless summer transition pieces that can go from a day dress into incredible sexy night outfit. the fabric was very lush and had this rich gloss to it, i have never seen a fabric like that, it almost looked coated. red being such a statement piece was a bit too much for me, so i decided to order the produ
4 I tried the size 2, regular in store. they were a bit roomy and since i am 5'3", i was glad that they were offered in petite. they did not carry petites in the store so they ordered a petite 0 for me. i tried them on when i received them and they fit like they had been tailor made for me. the rise was a bit short but not a deal breaker, however, they were very long and i hoped that i had shoes that were high enough. i often hem pants but figure when i buy petites there is no need. also, the hem
4 I was so disappointed in this top. the fabric blend was too thick for summer. the cut was wide across the shoulders, and very narrow and short through the waist. add in the odd splashes in the print, and it spelled disaster.size: i tend to run between small and xs. i ordered xs. i'm 5'5" tall, 135 lbs, 34d, 35-29-37, narrow across shoulders, with short arms and long torso.fit: the cut was so wide across my narrow shoulders that it looked baggy and felt odd. however, the sleeves didn't sl
4 I got m in black with white. it's ok. material is soft and nice. classy. plan to return it since color is not flattering, makes me look old.
4 I tried this on in the store and almost considered buying it until i looked at the price tag. i think it's unique and interesting. i just don't think it's worth the $$$. the fabric is nothing special and the construction is not complicated enough to warrant the cost. i would consider it on sale. retailer has more interesting sweaters made with softer blends for a similar price - all things considered i don't think it's a smart purchase.
4 The design is graceful and both my kids said it was a keeper "pretty," even the boy child.somehow i feel it makes my tummy look bigger than it is, maybe with the belt on my jeans.
4 This is a lovely dress with a soft fabric that drapes over the body. the pattern is soft and feminine, very much like the picture. my only issue, which is why i didn't give it 5 stars for my overall rating, is it's a bit snug around the bodice. this could be because i'm a lifelong swimmer however, my bra size is 34 b or c depending, so this shouldn't be an issue for this dress.other stats: 5'7" 117 lbs and i got this in an extra small per recommendations of other reviewers. the small would b
4 Just bought this today and i love it. so simple, and at the same time it's not. the fabric makes it casual to dress up or down, but the shape of it is incredible and what takes it above simple. the straps felt a little long, so i will likely get it altered to be shortened in the straps. got the red and it's gorgeous.
1 These run very small!! they are also short, almost like a crop pant. the fit was so weird that i won't even exchange for a bigger size.
1 Very cheap looking material. looks cheap to cost $158.
1 This dress had so much potential. looked cute when i received it. put it on & couldn't wait to take it off. it's shapeless, top heavy & just overall unflattering. the material could be cute....on a totally different dress. don't waste your money.
4 I loved this when i saw it online. tried it on in the store, and though it is beautiful, it's a lot of sweater. its a a bit heavy in weight, the buttons on the collar give you the option to wear it up or open as shown in the picture. the problem was that when it was open the big button loop hung down right in front. that was probably the determining factor against purchasing it. if it goes on sale i may reconsider.
4 Very soft and comfy tee. like the interesting neckline. wish the petite neckline was slightly higher, but sleeves are right length and have great cuffs.
4 Beautiful color,, great quality, and great fit if you size up! i learned my lesson with previous purchases and sized up when i read it runs small. i usually wear a 0/2 and i took a risk and went for the 4. it fits perfectly. i have a 25 in waist.
4 Love this shirt it has a femine look with a casual style.
4 This is a cute top that can transition easily from summer to fall. it fits well, nice print and it's comfortable. i tried this on in the store, but did not purchase it because the color washed me out. this is not the best color for a blonde. would look much better on a brunette. if this was in a different color i most likely would have purchased it.
4 This dress does indeed run large like the other reviewers mentioned, but it also runs small in the shoulders. i'm 5'3" and usually a size 6. the xs fit perfectly in the body, but was a little too small in the shoulders. i liked the dress enough to size up to a small to fit the shoulders, and then just had the sides taken in slightly. i did purchase this dress during the 20% off sale, so that helped justify the cost of alterations.
4 This cardigan is lovely, casual layering piece. it's a very thin lightweight knit and pairs well with a tee or tank under it. i really like the color and the style. the longer front can drape or tie for multiple looks
1 It's the inverted invert ... not so obvious at first but then it shrunk and was harder to ingnore.
4 The prints are very cute and flattering and the material is thick. i'm 5'2 107lb and 32c and got the xsp, my usual size. the shoulders and sleeves fit perfectly, the neckline is a little low (questionable for work). the fit however is off on the waist -- which is not as pictured. it is more of an empire waist ad barely even clears my boobs, so i doubt even a regular xs will change this much. it isnt a flattering look on my frame altho the prints hide it somewhat, except from the side view. also,
4 I purchased in white. the material is a little thinner than i like, but the material is soft. runs tts over all. the arms are long-but i like this in a t-shirt. i will probably pick up another color in this shirt.
4 I definitely trend towards preferring my clothes looser as a style but the fit on this dress felt a bit too boxy, i typically run between and x-small and small, should have gone with the x-small. i loved the print and quality of the dress though and would recommend it!
4 I bought my usual size medium and it's huge on me. if i sized down, my chubneck wouldn't be comfortable. the buttons are frustrating. the color, the pattten, the style are 100% gorgeous! i think i will belt mine
4 I love tunics, i love sweaters, i love turquoise. i ordered this in large, and it fits well, but the arms are very long. i don't like constantly pushing sleeves up so i wear it with the cuffs turned back. a previous reviewer commented on the length and another about the bagginess. i didn't have issues with either. it hits just above my knee (5'5") and it is appropriately proportioned around the the body of the sweater. so what's my reservation? how the sweater is more delicate than it seems. the
4 I'm an hourglass shape and on me this dress didn't give me any shape at all. and i felt the bell sleeves were a little much. the lining though is really soft and excellent for colder weather. and the print is very pretty, just as pictured.
1 I found that this dress ran very small. i am true 8, ordered a 10 and it was snug
4 Loved everything about this sweater but the short length.  didn't notice in the pictures but the last one of the back of the model shows the length. it barely reached the very top of my jeans so would have to wear something under or i'd be flashing my stomach all the time.  worked a bit better with skirts, but still too cropped for my frame. wish it was 1-2" longer in length and would have been a new fall favorite. really great color and design besides that. just make sure you are wanting the sh
4 I was skeptical about the contrasting color details on this blazer, and it turns out i was right to be. this blazer just looks like part of a prep school uniform, both in the colors and the fit, which is very boxy. maybe this is someone's style, but i just don't think it looks good.
4 Last minute i needed a family-friendly top for a chilly night, so i tried on a couple of flowy sweaters at retailer and this was the keeper. while i found other styles a bit too boxy or bulky for my short torso, this has a nice a-line shape that gave me a slim profile while still being forgiving, plus the detail up top is feminine and i liked not having fabric piled up around my neck. i am usually a small but wanted this to fit like the model so i sized up to a medium and voila, i am a model. just
4 This top is really cute for the right body shape.it is tight around the bust area if you select your size and sizing - you lose the shape.
4 The is a cute dress with a great pattern and nice material. it would look great on the right kind of figure. i'm 5'7" and slim, but at thirteen weeks pregnant and not showing, the skirt made me look about thirty weeks pregnant, but the top fit just fine.
4 I tried this on in white and my usual size small. it is such a beautiful top and the detailing, lace trim is so pretty. my only complaint is that it lays funny on my cleavage, and i don't have much. it just gathered there and appeared clingy in that area. it's also one of those...am i hiding a pregnancy tops. i like it, but i think i'll wait to see if it goes on sale.
4 I'm a little on the fence about this dress. it doesn't do much for my fairly straight/petite body type; i.e. it's not fitted at the waist which i think would help even though i don't have much of a waist to begin with. but the low v-neck is flattering and the flared skirt is too. it's just that it probably looks better on an hourglass shape... i was fine with the fabric type, i'd describe it as a mid-weight ribbed knit blend. i'd say it's true to size, i got my usual xspetite and i'm 34aa, 26",
1 This looked fabulous on the model, of course, and i love sweater dresses. but even in an xs, i was drowning in fabric and looked ludicrous. concept is good but execution went terribly wrong somewhere. a definite return.
1 Ag jeans have been a main stay for me. they are the most comfortable and best looking jeans on my body. however this pair was too tight and shorter then i liked. the fabric and color is beautiful. i wear the same size for ag no matter the design. but this one ran too small. i have to return it. i will try the next size up if they still have them.
1 I ordered this dress in the green color. the dress did not look like the picture. i returned the dress since it looked like something to wear to a farm barnyard dance. i returned the dress.
4 I really like this skirt. it is soft and the length is just right. i hate skirts that go below the knee. the only thing i don't care for is that there seems to be extra fabric in the back... maybe i should had ordered a size down. and the skirt does wrinkle easily. still, not enough reasons to send back. i have had many compliments at work.
4 If you are looking for a nice vest, this vest is nice enough, comfortable, and soft. the cut is also flattering, but i just didn't think it was as special as i wanted. it looks like many other options out there, so i decided to pass.xs fit me at 115 lbs.
1 Looked good in pictures. i even ordered an xxs petite and it was huge! although the sweater has interesting textures and is very beautiful, it is very awkward and poor fit. will be sending back.
4 Other reviewers have pointed out that these tops (i have both colors now, spoilers!) run long- and i am happy to agree. basically, there's a lot to work with here. i'm always looking for longer tops to traverse a larger bust, and this is a great hip-hitting length for me. plus, the neckline can be style multiple ways. all in all, a flattering better-than-basic sweater.
4 This dress will be very useful. it fits loose, but it is suppose to. i plan to wear this to casual parties, out to dinner, and possibly a wedding at a winery. i weigh am 5' 6", weigh 145 lbs, and ordered a medium.
4 This dress has a really lovely design and is very, very comfortable. it is not quite as flattering as i had hoped, and doesn't have quite as defined a shape as i expected. still, it's cute and i'm happy to have it!
4 I didn't realize the patterned material was tee shirt material. i got lots of compliments on it though. i'ts blowsey from the bust down (i got the short sleeved red one) but it's comfortable without looking sloppy. if you can pull off the tucked in look, it's super cute.
4 I really liked these cords. i ordered both colors. they are very lush corduroy material and the color is very rich. since i am short, i wear them as ankle length (i am 5'1"). my only issue is that they run very large. i am normally a 25-26 and the 25 was still a bit large. unfortunately, they are all sold out of size 24 :(
4 I tried on the xs in store (would need xxs i think, it is short enough to not need petite). anyway, the neck part was really bunching up on me (between neck and girls), it wasn't flattering. the rest of the tank is really pretty and flattering though, but the bunching was enough for me to leave it behind. the fabric is soft, and the color is nice warm neutral. i love the lace back with the subtle layer of satiny looking fabric. overall goo, perhaps i don't have the right shoulder shape fr this.
4 I decided on these last minute for a date last night and let me say...i looked hot. :) they are super cute and flattering (im slender, but hey, im also 53) and could be dressed up or down easily. the but is because when i got home i realized that i had ruined my new gel manicure from the black die! it comes off so easily that you should be cautious of your car seats, sofa, etc. i made the mistake of not washing first, but do! hopefully thats enough to help because these are great leggings.
4 The blue color is sublime - the material velvet iridescent cool - the fit is loose and not something to wear to show off your figure but it is has a cool swingy boho vibe that was what i was expecting ... add a cool shirt jacket to elevate it and give it more structure
4 I received this today and will have to send it back. it is super cute and the quality is great. however, you need to wear a bra or a halter bra due to the style which is not a proble, but my 32d chest looked huge in this top so it is going back.
1 Even at a very deep discount, this piece is definitely not worth the money. the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design (which would be cool)--which is largely what attracted me to it, but as i discovered when it arrived, that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo. so this image is rather misleading. the actual jacket is very thin--more like a shirt with an open front than a jacket. the pockets are just loosely tacked inside. for
4 I am 5' and 3/4" tall. too "tall" for most petite pants and too short for regular pants. these ran a little big. i weigh @140 lbs. and have been wearing mostly 28s and 29s, which is what i ordered. the 29s were a tad too big around the waist. the 28 fit but were so long that they looked like clown pants on me. i am in the conundrum that i can never find cropped pants that fit because i am in between petite and regular height sizing. these were a perfect example. they both went back. loved the qu
1 I loved how soft this dress was, as well as versatile. however, i only got to wear it one time because after the first wash, a giant fabric tear happened on one of the seams. unfortunately, the fabric is so soft, but rather thin, and it didn't hold. the care instructions say machine washable but i wouldn't put it in the washing machine again. especially since i often have to wash clothes twice in the washer i use because it's so old and barely agitates. would love this if it was made a little be
4 Beautiful, washes well in a garment bag on delicate. has little clips in the shoulders to hold bra straps which is crucial with the scoop back if you have sloped shoulders like mine. i normally go for a large, but was definitely a medium in this dress. 32" waist, 32f bra, only minor complaint is that the pattern (at least on the red, though probably also on the others) is just printed on the outside and the inside is faded almost white, so since the sides of the dress are slightly longer than
4 Everything about this dress is beautiful except for the hemline. the color is beautiful; the old-fashioned, wispy femininity is beautiful. the dress probably could use something better at the waistline besides elastic, maybe ribbons to tie, but the hemline is what kills it. it is half a normal-length dress (in the front) and half maxi dress (in the back). the designer should have chosen one or the other, not both, and it would have been much better. for the category of aesthetic/design, i would
4 Runs almost two sizes small. i plan to wear as a jacket over a sleeveless dress / skirt / trousers like a suit. the material is sturdy. i recommend for early autumn or spring weather. once again, a collector's item with unique colors and design of pattern.
4 This is my first pair of mcguire jeans, and i like the fabric and fit.  thank goodness for petite sizing!  these 32p fit just right on my hips, with no gap between the waistband and my body.  fits through thigh and hips and pretty slim all the way down.  nice stretch.  of course, the proof will be after wearing a few times and washing.  i will update my review if i do not like them so much after that,
4 I love this color blue. when this item went on sale i had to grab it and i'm glad i did. it feels medium weight to me so i could throw this on, on a cool summer night and also in the fall. there is some sparkle to the fabric which i think is really a nice added touch. feels comfortable on and looks adorable.
4 After reading the reviews, these leggings seemed to be the best leggings ever. i'm usually not a leggings gal, but decided these might be the ones to take me through winter with long cozy sweaters. i read the profile of those who purchased and were happy with the fit before making my purchase. i'm 5'2", 134lbs and bought a medium. while they fit nicely through the waist and thighs, from the knees down they're baggy and really don't fit like a legging. in the photo you can see some slack around t
4 I seldom take anything but a size m in retailer tops. this m top fits ok but it is a bit sloppy overall. one reviewer says it is 'body skimming' but not on me. i am a true m yet a m seems to fit in the shoulders but overall just too big. i love the fabric and print however i will exchange for a size s if it is available. it does hide the tummy area but ends up looking like a pajama top on me.
4 I am just over 5'8"and i found that these pants hit me in a weird spot on my torso, almost creating a muffin top that i don't normally have. in addition, they were too short on me to give the chic and modern look of cropped ankle pants. on my frame, they fit more like capris from the late 1990s. both the construction and execution of the pants are otherwise fantastic.
1 This top is beautiful in design, but sadly, i will be returning. it is hand wash, and even after doing so, i had 2 unraveled threads resulting in large holes. unfortunate since it was so flattering before washing.
4 I love this onesie! i get a lot of complements when i wear it. the only issue is that it's slightly too short in the mid section. it tends to give a tiny bit of a wedgie. but it's not nearly significant enough to give it a bad review or return it. overall it's comfortable. i did have to size up because of that issue but it still looks great.
4 I'm an xl in retailer tops, and the xl fits nicely in this blouse. if you are athletic or slender or have a petite bust, you can probably size down..this is a nice lightweight sweater. i would not say that it is too thin or anything like that; its just lightweight for being categorized as a sweater. i absolutely love the pattern placement of this sweater, it makes the sweater so unique and figure flattering. honestly, i'm not crazy about kimono/bell sleeves because i feel they are at best impr
4 I just got this shirt the other day, and already love it. it fits like a basic tee, but the details on the sleeves and back are really cute. the shape is loose at the bottom, which makes this really comfortable.my only complaint is it's a little tight across the back, but this does not hurt the overall fit and comfort of the top. this is a little thicker than a tee shirt too, so the quality feels nice.
4 I like this top. yes it is very cropped and fitted but that's the style as shown on the model in the picture. but its true this style may not fits everyone. it probably flatters those of athletic or petite figure more than a full figure. i am 5' 6" 110#. my usual size is xs. the top looks small to me at first so i tried both size xs and s. i took the xs cause i like it look fitted than loose. i wear this top with high waist fitted skirts or pants and it looks great. if this top can be an inch lo
4 Really beautiful top. i agree with the others, a bit on the short side. it is cut a little wide but has a nice flow. the color is not pink. it is a blush type color that can be hard to wear for some skin tones, but i'm going to make it work because the top is too pretty to pass up.
4 I'm 5'4" and weight 130 and i usually wear a small in dresses from retailer. although this fits everywhere, it's a tad shorter than i expected based on the fact i figured the model was at least 5/7" and this looks to be mid-thigh.. it's mid-thigh on me so i'll be wearing tights and boots- can't wear without tights...imho. otherwise, so comfortable and cute...
4 I was so excited about this dress. but when i got it, there were several issues i had with it. the neck is just too high for me and the skirt is too pleated and makes my hips look wide. i was hoping for more of an a-line cut. gorgeous though! wish it worked.....
4 This is a nice, heavy sweater for cold days and lounging in jeans. very comfortable and flattering.
4 I ordered the red/orange but it was much brighter than i expected (felt almost neon). and the dress felt much more casual than i expected from the pictures online. that said, it's a great dress and i am keeping it - just adjusting my expectations/what i plan to wear it for.
4 I ordered down a size based on other reviews. i am 5' tall, 110 lbs and a size 26 is a great fit. i ordered both the navy and turquoise colors. my only complaint is the turquoise color is not the vibrant blue in the photo but more of a green tone.
4 The lace detail is very classy. a great go to white dress.
1 They ripped on the inside upper thighs of both legs less than two months after purchase. i've washed them once, and wear them a few times a week, so they're certainly not worn out. i've never had a pair give out even close to this early. i loved the cut of the jeans and the softness, and they hold their shape well after multiple wearings. the color is lighter than pictured. i paid full price (the most i've ever paid for jeans) because i'd heard good things about jean shop quality. even at sale p
4 This top is very nice heavier weight linen. i normally wear a small or size 6 in retailer but this seemed a bit on the larger size than normal. it's still great quality and i'll probably keep it. a great item to wear for a long time!
4 I agree that this blouse is boxy, but because it's not too long in length it evens it out. any longer or shorter would make it look too boxy. it's great for work to dinner during the week & goes great with jeans too.
4 Very cute, but i would not call it pink. it's more of a melon color.
4 I bought this blouse in the purple motif and love it for work. great design and print.based on the existing reviews, i sized down from my normal xs to an xxs and i actually wish that i would have stuck with the xs only because the blouse is tighter on my biceps than i would prefer, but i am keeping the blouse. i always appreciate this in other reviews, so hopefully it helps: i'm 5'2", 117 lbs, and a small 32b.
4 I love this top and find it flattering, but the black and white polka-dotted motif that i purchased definitely has navy blue in it -- not black. kind of disappointing that the color description was so inaccurate.
4 These tanks are perfect for working out! they have big armholes so could work with a bralette but probably not a normal bra. the material is soft but they do shrink in th wash
4 These jeans are great quality, but they just hit too low for me to be comfortable.
1 1. i like a shorter jacket, but this one was poorly made and poorly fit.2. the sleeves were way too tight. i'm a size 10 or 12, and the large which would be a 14 had tight sleeves that wrinkled up my arms, and the hem of the sleeve turned inside out.3. i ordered both a medium (size 10) and a large (size 14) , and neither hung right. the m too tight, and the large too loose in the body and too tight in the sleeves.4. very polyester with lots of static.5. cute idea, but not very good in pe
1 I really wanted to love this dress, but i couldn't. it ran large and heavy. rather than a sleek cocktail dress, it felt more like a heavy sack once i put it on. there was one upside: the drape in the back did not appear to drop quite as low, so finding a bra to wear under the dress might be easier than if it draped as low as it appears in the picture.
4 I have 9.5-10 size feet, and these are a bit small; the heel doesn't quite make it around my heel to where it's supposed to be. still, they're comfy and not too thick or too warm. i really like the stripes of different patterns. good trouser socks. i imagine if you're size 7 or 8 these will fit perfectly. i got the mint and the pink colors, and they're very true to how they appear on my computer screen.
1 Agree with other poster. this shirt runs very big. i'm all for a flowy, shirt that hides my belly but this is just a tent. i'll be retuning it.
4 This will be my third pair of hei hei shorts.  i was very pleased with the previous two shorts, sand city short and dobby beach comber.  all shorts have nice materials and not too tight, perfect for the summer.  i typically wear s or m depending with the material and design.  i bought size s and it fits nicely.
4 I really love the fit of this dress. i said it runs true to size, and it really does--even with the stretch fabric around the back and adjustable straps, i would not recommend sizing down as i normally do at retailer--there is no stretch to the actual fabric on the dress. i'd never bought anything by this brand before, and i would say that the fabric is quite thin for the price of the dress, and it is not lined (i'm still hoping it's not see through). however, for me, the style makes up for
4 This is nicer than the first reviewer states. the fabric feels very soft and the tunic does not look cheap.the top of the tunic was a little more fitted so it was a little tight for me since i have wide shoulders. i will have to get a larger size.
1 I keep trying to find a peplum that works for me, but so far i have been unsuccessful. i just do not think that my shape and the peplum shape play well together?aside from the peplum issue, this shirt had a massive amount of material and runs large. the material alone is thick, making it a bulkier shirt, then add the volume of the peplum and i looked (and felt) huge. needless to say, this one was returned, sale or no sale.
4 Received this yesterday, wearing it today and am happy.  it&#39;s warm and cozy - perfect blend of sweatshirt and sweater for when you want to be comfortable, yet still look like you tried. i&#39;m 5&#39;4.5&quot; and 130 lbs. i ordered an xs and it&#39;s still pretty roomy which is how i think it&#39;s supposed to fit. i would prefer it to be a little more form fitting, but not enough to send back.  great with skinny jeans and boots.
4 Love this kimono. design is bohemian and it will be a great layering piece. can be belted over simple black dress or layered with jeans and boots. almost didn't purchase because of the reviews concerned with fragile material but i didn't find that to be an issue once i felt the garment. great piece for fall.
4 Oh yes. another sequin top to add to my collection. it is sparkly without being glittery- if you know what i mean. can definitely dress down as it is tee shirt- like. lots of options for this one. tts.  much better in person than the online pics.
4 I couldn't wait to try this dress on when i first saw it featured. it is stunning! i love the red lace over-layed with a blue slip. it adds a fun color contrast to the piece. i am usually a size 6 in retailer clothing and found this one comfortably true to size. this dress has a very renaissance chic quality which is very feminine, flirty and unique. a great find for fall/winter parties. i can't wait to wear it!if i had to find a fault with this dress, it's the lack of pockets. retailer d
1 I wish i had read the reviews prior to purchasing. this skirt looks amazing in photos and lace appears black. the lace on mine is actually purple - at first i thought it was just purple due to lighting with red underneath - but nope - pull the netting away and it is purple. lace netting hikes up on the right due to poor craftsmanship. i ordered a medium and felt it was a bit large. will return.
4 This is a beautiful blouse. very pretty and looks well made. unfortunately i had to send it back. i'm looking for a more classic cut. it has an a line/tent shape. when i put it on and put my arms above my head, the bottom of the blouse was up to my bra!i would order from this brand again.
4 I love the quality of this little gem. it's going to be used as an under a sweater top and also to fill a v-neck line dress up that's too low for me. it's made very well in my opinion but it runs a bit too full so if you are between sizes you could easily go down a size.
4 Great print and material, but this top runs large. i'm 36c and usually wear l in most lines retailer carries, but this was just big. i reordered in a medium.
1 I am almost always an xs in bottoms (sz 0-2) but literally couldn't get the stretchy waistband (no zip or fastening) in xs up my hips. in addition, the "brocade" is a very lightweight polyestery, tinselly weave--does not suggest quality. as others have noted, it also runs short; i'm 5'3'' and this was a little below knee length on me, not ankle-length. i've had luck with retailer's sale section in the past, including some items that didn't always start off with the best reviews, but have no regret
4 While i love this top ( beautiful color and pattern) i found it to be a bit short.  if it were a few inches longer i would be thrilled.  i'm 5'8 ,  curvy, and have a long torso-- so that may be the problem. i will say that within 2 hours of wearing this, i had 5 strangers stop me and comment re: how pretty it is. i am keeping it :)
4 I loved this on the mannequin and assumed it would look terrible on me. i tried it on anyway and was delightfully surprised. i tried a small and it was too roomy in the top so i opted for the extra small. i'm 5'6" and 130 lbs, (27 in jeans, 34a). my booty definitely fills it out but the rest of the fit is similar to the model. it is hard to get on and off but if you tie a looser bow before slipping it over your head it's much easier to get back on and you can tighten it up again fairly easily. f
1 Loved the colors but the fit was less to be desired. very wide under arms & too much material. looks more like a maternity dress. i ordered a small petite & would have needed the xs but now it is no longer available. oh well. returning this.
4 This dress is gorgeous in person and very flattering, but i was surprised at the weight and i found the armholes, especially with the picot edge detail, too tight and a bit irritating. i do have a 32 dd bust, so i'm not sure if that was the problem, but i've never had that problem in any of the retailer dresses i've purchased in the last few years. (and there were a lot of them.) i tried on my regular petite small and that was the correct size.
4 I ordered this online in red. i would definitely say this color is more of an orange-red. i like the weight and the cut. i keep wishing the material was a soft modal vs what it is. the ribbing up top does not bother me but it definitely does make it a casual dress. (which is what i wanted so i'm happy with it) it fits me nicely, the straps (for me) could be a hare shorter to fit perfectly. that being said, i'm 5'5" and have a thin build. small bust. i would say there is a some leeway for 1 s
4 Great fun pattern. sexy styling. the other reviewers commented on how the trim is white and the body is ivory- i actually liked that. i am 5'4" and 120 lbs. i usually wear a 4 and ordered a medium in this suit. bottom was super small and is sold out in large so i had to return it
4 The color and pattern are so cute and fun. they are also very soft and comfortable. most important, these pants still keep everything covered when i bend into a forward fold.
4 If you are shaped anything like me, you will have to size up quite a bit on this one. i tried it on in my normal size and probably needed to size up 2 or more sizes to get the proper fit. the fabric has no "give" and feels a little cheap in my opinion. for your reference, i am a curvy, athletic build with broad shoulders.
4 I'm 5'5" 120 lbs and i bought these in a 0. they fit great. i wore them for upwards of 12 hours and i was very comfortable. i received compliments on the print and cut. very flattering.
4 The inseam is advertised as 28", but they are more like 38". i was hoping they were for short people, but they are for someone with very long legs, event in my tallest heels, i'd have to get them hemmed! just a warning to my short friends out there. the quality, fit, look was great, but way way way too long.
4 I ordered an xs regular and it barely skims the floor when i'm wearing wedges or heels - perfect! it's form fitting but not clingy, and i think it's a pretty, comfortable dress. glad i made the purchase!
1 This is a very soft and comfortable jacket but it has holes in the pocket area. it was returned to the store and the other jackets had the same problem although not in the same area. the store was considering pulling the product off their shelves. it is unclear if the holes are just the beginning of a pocket or what. but it was flawed by everyone who looked at it.
1 I'm normally a small in retailer tops. i ordered a small, and the top fit well in the shoulders and in the upper (more fitted) part. it all went horribly wrong from there. the top billowed out at the bottom and fit like a circus tent, instantly adding a good 50 pounds to my frame. this was such a disappointment, as the pattern is beautiful and the fabric is high quality.
1 This dress has pretty colors. the top fit well but the bottom looked like an upside down umbrella. it has enough material to make 2 skirts and the big pockets on the sides make the skirt stick out sideways. the photo of model is from side, not the front. very unflattering on me.
4 I love the flower patterns. they add feminine touch. this legging is well made with good quality spandex. the only cons is the color is not as deep as the picture. when you wearing it and the fabric stretched, the color looks much lighter. other than that, it's a good buy!
4 Easy to wear and very cute, especially for curvy ladies. but, i think it looks best worn with a best, or a blazer on top, something to emphasize the waist a bit more.
4 I'm always nervous about length on ponchos, and this one was perfect (fit like the model and i am 5'7"). it is definitely a thin/semi-sheer knit, but it looks so classy and elegant with a black long sleeve under it and jeans. i love that this doesn't require dry cleaning and makes me look put-together for an easy day to night look. i'm 25 weeks pregnant and love that this works now and later :) very happy with this purchase!
4 This is a pretty tunic/dress that looks and fits exactly as shown. i imagine that it would be quite long on anyone under 5'5" or so, since it falls maybe 2 inches above the knee on me at 5'7". it's cute, and an easy throw on and go piece. the quality is even good. i decided to return it though because it felt a little plain for the price...maybe if it were more exciting colors or patterns? a slightly more fitted cut? i couldn't place my finger on the exact thing that wasn't clicking for me, but
4 I&#39;m 5&#39;3&quot; 118 lbs and the 26 navy fit great.  the gray i can hardly button and are less flattering.  i will order another size 26 in gray to see if it will fit better, but also try a 27.
4 This jacket is really cute! however, the mesh is really fragile. i've had the jacket for a month and noticed a huge tear down the back shoulder. it doesn't fit me tight so i'm not sure how it happened. every time i wear it i'm super paranoid about snagging it on something. like i mentioned before, the jacket is cute. it's lightweight and the design is unique. but if you want to get more than an occasional wearing out of this then don't bother. i'm hoping i can return it otherwise that's a lot of
4 Easy to wear! cute, comfy...will be a go to for summer.
1 The photo misrepresents how large this sweater is. it is giant! petite ladies stay away from this sweater. i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs, but this just floored me. the neckline wouldn't even stay up on my upper body, it was that loose. also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model. it is like a tent. i'm so bummed. the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft. it's too bad it doesn't fit smaller women.
4 I got this dress and think it's just great. it's a bit formal, but a bit whimsical at the same time. i really disagree with others said about the opening along the arms. i think they are barely noticeable but are nice surprise. this is a perfect california winter dress. i could see how a woman in colder parts of the country might not appreciate the slits on the arms but i think it's nice to show a little skin in a conservative way. i plan to wear it to a classical music concert soon. and i got i
4 ...but it does have it's problems. the neck, although it has pretty button detail at the back, is very outsized on me. i would like to see it fit a bit more snugly as by not laying flat, necklaces bunch up and are hard to wear with it. it is just sort of 'floppy' if i'm making sense. the camisole liner is nicely made and attaches with snaps at the shoulders which gives this a definite plus. the fabric is sort of like chiffon with appliquã©d flowers. the color combination is beautiful and with the
4 This dress is so cute and unique. i got many compliments when i wore it to an event recently and i know it will be a great summer dress. it definitely runs small and short on me. i am usually a 2/4 and needed a 6 in this dress.
4 I love these jeans and want to keep them but they are so long! im 5'7 and they wrap all the way under my feet so i cant even have them altered because it would cut the flare out. its kind of crazy how long they are.
4 I knew i had to have this shirt when i saw it online. the embroidery is almost like english smocking. i was not disappointed when i opened my package. the only flaw i've noticed is that it does "pucker" slightly around the shoulders and chest area due to the tight embroidery not allowing it to stretch. it is not terribly noticeable though. lovely shirt all around.
4 I agree with everything the other reviewer stated. this top is very billowy and runs large, it would be nice if i didn't have a chest! the other issue with this top is the macrame detailing is made more out of a satin like material and i wanted it to look closer to natural raw fiber. the pink is slightly more pink in person but it's not that far off. had to return.
4 This is a beautiful dress and i would recommend.but it was short on me (tall), not the midi i was hoping for. and a little too low cut (too much cleavage), i'm a d cup.since i paid full price, i have to be completely pleased with my purchase, for this reason i will return. maybe if i had bought it on sale price, then i would keep.
4 Cute and perhaps a little too innocent for my age because the petite was too high and wide on me.  fits great on my shoulders/chest and the flare can be controlled with a layer and belt.  i already have a few ivory lace dresses that look age appropriate first try.  i don't think i have the right personality for this one.  looks great on everyone else i've seen wearing it!
4 Nice, flowy, comfy top with soft fabric. there's a lot of fabric below the waist - it could probably work as a maternity top - but it drapes nicely rather than looking overwhelming. i do find that the buttons gap a little at the chest, despite the top fitting loosely on me, so i have to wear a layer under it.
4 Great fit and quality. i'm 5'3" and 130 lbs, size 4 fit perfectly. bought both the blue and black. could definitely dress up or down!
4 I love the look of this dress but wish the bottom was lined like the top is. it's a little sheer without the lining.
4 Love the subtle pattern, i think it will be great for a number of occasions. the fit is very flattering. not lined, but high quality heavyweight fabric does not seem to make it necessary.
4 Love the dress, a little cheaply made but overall, it fits nice and will be great next fall. it will show tummy shape so if you do not have a flat tummy, this may not be the dress for you.
4 The material is so soft and i really like the design (i got the map one). as others mentioned, sleeves are quite short, almost morel like a muscle tee than a t-shirt, but i don't mind. looks really cute under a cardigan for fall too.
4 The design/pattern balances broader shoulders/narrower hips and gives my straighter waist definition.at 5'1", size 2 ended mid-knee, but overall felt a little too long (torso length). i normally take 0p or 00p in retailer dresses.i like the feel of the fabric and the overall playful yet chic look.
4 Just got these and love them. the blue color is a great bright shade without being too crazy and they fit well. i'm 5'7" 138# straight build and ordered 27 (true to size for me.) they have loosened up throughout the day and the waist and hips are a bit baggy now but i like that they're not ultra-tight. nice light fabric for the summer.
4 I made the mistake of ordering a medium instead of large and have the same fit issues as other reviewers. it is tight in the back through the shoulders, so if you're considering it i would stick with your larger of your size range. the print is beautiful as is the fabric. it looked okay on me from the side but i am short waisted. it fell at the perfect length on me too. there's just something about the fit that didn't wow me so i don't plan to reorder, but i do think it would be lovely on thinne
4 Beautiful print. agree with other reviewers that the small snap at the bust is inadequate for anyone with a d or greater bust size. the dress was a perfect length on me with heels - even after i kicked off my heels i didn't find it too long like other reviewers. wind does open op the front so i may get it altered so it's no longer a true wrap dress
4 Some quick notes- it is not sheer, like a previous poster was asking. there is a lining. the color is darker than it appears online, which was ok with me. i thought it still looked nice as a deeper gold. i was excited about this top, and thought it was the perfect thing for a casual/festive company holiday party. i ordered a m, and am usually between m and s in most retailer items. unfortunately it fit me rather boxy and short. i have a larger bust (30g) and it draped in a very unflattering way. m
4 I tried on areturn at my store, size 26 (i am often a 25 in jeans) - because these are tighter fit, teh 26 was fine. length was long though, but fit comfortably and looked nice. the cutout was at my knee, which bothered me a tad (model, seems a bit above the knee). i decided not to purchase them as i found another pair i liekd better, but if you are taller and are looking for a distressed skinny, these are great. (i am 115 lbs and have thighs ad butt form working out)
4 Was hoping i was going to love this top and i did. its a fun piece to dress up or down.
4 I love white for summer and by august i am tired of wearing sleeveless...so this caught my eye. it is very easy to wear and pretty on. i wore it with black tie up shoes and accessories. super comfy & stylish.
1 I made the mistake of ordering without checking the reviews. cute design but not as comfy as it looks. returned immediately.
4 I ordered this because it looked to be a good fit for my casual lifestyle. and it doesn't disappoint! it's cozy, lightweight but warm, flows well and looks great tied or worn loose. i ordered my regular size large in the grey. it fits as shown, just a bit longer because i'm short. the color is more of a blue gray with white striations that are well placed. it's really striking for such a casual piece. very pretty. highly recommend.
4 Classic design with nice details. stays in place for those active bikini wearers.
4 I had been looking for an off the shoulder top (or open shoulder) as the trend is really in right now, but that proves more difficult for me (muscular traps and shoulders, not always flattering)... anyway, i decided to order this ( i saw it paired with a wide-leg jeans, tucked in)... that is how i like it... tucked in. it is otherwise a little boxy on me (wide shoulders means the whole thing shifts out. the fabric si a tiny bit wrinkle-prone, but not too badly. both colors are nice, but thought
1 I thought it was only me and immediately assumed i needed to go on a diet when i attempted to put this adorable skirt on. it got stuck at my hips. i'm a very consistent size small in dresses and skirts. i actually thought about putting it on over my head but that was impossible. its going back. now i see the other reviews and am relieved that its the skirt and not me! wish i had read them before purchasing. retailer is going to get a lot of returns on this one.
4 Uncomfortable in the leg area, but otherwise very flattering.
1 There are darts that are not shown in this picture that make the dress ill fitted. not sure why they are not in the picture and on the dress. i wish the pictures shown were more accurate.
4 This dress is great but extremely short. i'm 5'6" wear a size 4/6. the 6 looked like a tunic on me it was so short.
4 Very cute dress! 5'4, 120 lbs - xs regular was too long, xs petite was perfect length!
1 I ordered the shirt bc it looked soo cute despite the fact many said this shirt was see thru. it's true.. had to return it
4 Purchased this tee online and could not be happier with what arrived in my mailbox. this tee is perfect to throw on to run errands or out to lunch. the fabric is so soft, fit is true to size, i don't like tight fitting shirts, if you do i suggest ordering down a size. overall great detail, fit and just as pictured!
1 I love the idea of this top, but there is just way too much fabric involved in person! i'm 5'2 and usually wear a small or medium to accommodate a fuller chest. i ordered a small and it fit fine around the chest but the huge swing hem combined with the slightly stiff fabric is just enormously unflattering. i feel like they could have made about 3 shirts out of it. i think the picture must have it pinned a ton in the back, the silhouette is nothing like shown. if there were just less fabric, i wo
4 I love this top so much i tried it on twice. because i forgot why it didn't work the first time: i have a chest. i'm just a c cup, but i looked lumpy and matronly in this top. if that's not an issue for you, i think you'll love it.
4 I absolutely love this suit and was very disappointed to have to return it! it is really well made and the fabric colors/design is beautiful in person. unfortunately it just did not fit my body type. i am athletic build with a smaller chest and thicker behind, 120lbs, 5'4. the small was definitely the right size for me, but the back of the suit cut way high up on the butt so that a lot of the rear is exposed, which just did not work well for me. this will work great for someone with a smaller bu
4 Very pretty blouse with nice detail. needs to be worn with a camisole however.
4 Love the swing-style boxy fit. versatile - works well over jeans or any pants and top. like the coated linen (or cotton?) look. serves much the same purpose as any light weight or denim jacket - good to wear over a top to complete an outfit or as an extra thin layer but not a substantial outdoor jacket. really quite cute. fairly tts but if between sizes, size down.
4 I bought this dress in red for a wedding. i love the laser-cut design and the fit overall is good except, as another reviewer wrote, the psuedo-empire waste is likely not awesome for anyone with an average to longer torso. i have a super long torso and the dress still works, but a lower waist would have taken it from good to "wow". love the innovative take on a classic silhouette/design, though (and the red is gorgeous).
4 This is a great, effortless top. you can dress it up or down and fits true to size. it's forgiving and the straps draw your eye to the most flattering part of the body. the fabric is stretchy and and comfortable.
4 These jeans fit great, but i think getting the right size is key. i bought my usual denim size 26 and at first i thought they were too tight. but as the day wore on, they softened and conformed to my body and fit like a glove. if i bought them in a larger size, i'm afraid they'd bag out like jeans tend to do. i think it's the "legging" style that makes them so form fitting. i wish they were ankle length like on the model, but i'm 5'5" and they are quite a bit longer on me than the model.
4 Cute top. definitely sheer so need an undershirt. really love details on it, especially back and fringe at bottom. 5'4, 135 lbs, ordered s.
4 This shirt runs big, it's very long. material is very pretty and it is lined. i am keeping it for that spontaneous need to wear something sparkly...dinner party maybe?
1 The material that was used to make this top is very thin and poor quality. it feels like the type of material that will disintegrate after one wash. i normally wear an xl and this top is huge and not flattering. returning asap.
4 This is a very nice dress. the jersey is soft and high quality. the construction appears solid. the color is very pretty, and looks in real life just like it does on my computer. the cut and draping just don't work for me. there's just too much draping, too much fabric. it overwhelmed me and made me look bigger than i am. i have a feeling this would be much more flattering on a curvier figure than my own. this dress seemed to be trying to accentuate curves i don't really have (especially in the
4 This sweater is really pretty. it is a little itchy, but seems really well made. i also like that you have the option of wearing it open with the tie tied in the back for some shape. a nice alternative to the basic cardigan.
4 The stitching is why i like this dress. even though the arms and waist were a little large on me, i decided to keep it because of the beautiful pattern. (i think going a size down from what i normally wear would be too tight across my back or too short.) i will wear it with a cardigan, tights, and boots as the weather gets cooler.
4 First, let me say i really like these pants before i get into what's wrong with them. the fabric is a nice weight and drapes really pretty. they are very long for you leggy girls out there or ladies who like to wear platform shoes and that's a plus for me.now for the issues: the waist runs small, but not so much that i can't wear them. they are roomy and comfy otherwise, just snug there. the hem came out of mine, so that's the big bummer here. i have to hem them, which is a chore and i wish th
4 I ordered the white solid & the white w/blue stripes versions in size xl. both fit me true to size. the fit matches the model's photos. i got these on sale and they're worth that price. they're great basics to have. the white/blue striped one is my favorite. it such a pretty combo. i love the unique neckline too. fun details for a basic tee.
4 Tts - bought my usual pilcro size. enjoy the fit of these better than the serif style.
4 I tried on the skirt today in the store and immediately fell in love with how fluid the fabric is and how it looks and feels on, but i had something really awful happen, the zipper was hard to zip up so i just left it partially zipped but close to the top but then when i try to take it off the zipper broke and split down the middle but it was stuck on me! it was the strangest thing that i've ever had happened, and really embarrassing because i had to come out of the fitting room like that to get
4 Just received and sorry to return. i am 5'9" i wear a size 8 i ordered the m/l . it way really big and to wide
4 I ordered this to go over a dress. i wanted the jacket short, to not cover the waist of the dress. on sale, i think it is a great bargain. the sleeves are long on me, but i rolled them, which i thought was intended since they are lined. the medium fit me. i am usually an 8 in tops. the ivory color is almost a pure white.
4 This dress is very small in the bust and maxi length on short people (5'3" 36dd). i can't wear a normal bra, i have to use adhesive pasties. the fabric is very smooth, thick and satin like, but fuzzes easily. mine came with minor thread pulls and one strap was sewn on twisted. the pattern in real life is very pink as opposed to the model sample which has more blue landscape. i'd like to hem the dress but i would sacrifice pattern. still very pretty dress. be sure to size up one or two depending
1 I had my eye on this dress for months. i came into some extra cash and bought it at full price online and picked it up in the store. the purple pattern is nowhere near as soft as pictures. it was very bright which disappointed me. it's also made for more busty women. at a 34d i could in no way fill this dress out. the result made it look so frumpy and unflattering. i felt like an old lady in a bag.
4 Definitely cute and good fit but the distressing at knee is open and will probably get worse, worth it if price lower... maybe
4 I tried on a small, but usually am xs:this shirt dind't seem like it had too much fabric or too bulky to me as it did to others adn i tried on a larger size. teh material is soft and feminine, and love the embroidered detail. one thing to note is i found that even with the layer of fabric, it was still a bit sheer and i could see through in some of the dressing room lighting. didn't purchase only based on the skin tone v's shirt color. color of shirt is gorgeous, but i am pale and it wasn't
4 I ordered this top in a xs which is what i usually wear in most tops. a little big but just shrunk it. very comfy and love the color.
4 This dress is beautiful! i normally do not order online because i am so picky with how clothes fit. i am 5'4 and 138 lbs. i recently had a baby, so i am self conscious about my tummy area still. this dress fits great and looks great on! it's sort of "a" shaped, but very flattering and still gives you a good overall shape. the colors are a redish orange, navy and creamish white. i'm having to exchange it at the moment because it came in missing both buttons on each sleeve. the buttons are necessa
4 This sweater is great for cold weather. it is very comfortable and soft. only down side is it is a little boxy.
4 I did size up on this one. it came in and it was too snug for a loose shirt. i sized up and i love it now. i went to the store and bought it in white and black. i sized up in the white but not the black. you may want to try them on before purchasing them. i want more.
4 I love anna sui's lines makeup to everything. this dress is beautiful in a very usual sort of way and after trying it on, i couldn't see anything spectacular that made it unique or special somehow. the elastic waist does make this dress forgiving and it runs big. the hem is lovely scalloped. each detail is very nice in and of itself but when put together in this dress, there is no wow that justifies the full price tag. now that it's on sale i'll keep it probably for summer.
4 I have to disagree with earlier reviewers who suggested this top isn't flattering for larger-breasted women. i'm breastfeeding, so i currently have dds that are the bane of my existence, and i was very happy with the way this top fit across my chest. i didn't give it a full 5 stars for aesthetic/design only because i wish it were a bit longer. it hit me below my waist, but not below the crotch of my jeans where it hits the model (possibly because she is not burdened by swollen breasts). the shir
1 As much as i buy from retailer, this is my first review. the pictures do not accurately show how large this dress is in person. i wanted something that was a bit flowy, but this was a reminder of little house on the prairie. the most unflattering dress ever and since it's only available online, i'm not interested enough to try a smaller size.
4 This is a beautiful dress! i bought the red color in petite and love it. i know i will wear it a lot and the style is really easy to wear. i feel amazing in it even tho my post baby body isn't what it was.
4 I was pleasantly surprised when i tried this on. i tried it because of the detail but didn't hold out much hope because it looked frumpy on the hanger. i was very wrong. it fits beautifully. it drapes nicely, hugs the shoulders perfectly and doesn't droop open due to the embellishments. there is a tiny closure where the fabric crosses in the front so you are not exposed. i liked that feature very much. the sleeves are 3/4 on me, but i like it - nice change of pace. this is a very different style
4 I love this designer so i grabbed at this shirt immediately. unlike their other items, this shirt is linen. it's a great cut and very flattering once you iron it. the only problem i found was that as i wore it throughout the day, she shirt became wrinkled and misshapen to the point where it ballooned out around my stomach.
4 I love the way this dress looks on me. it skims my figure to hide my flaws, the bright embroidery is eye catching, the layers flow when i walk, it's a great midi length and it doesn't make me look wider in profile.  i'm not having the see-through issue since the patterns are busy and my lingerie matches.  i purchased 10 petite and my measurements are 39-28-35. my dilemma is three fold: the material is polyester & rayon, causing some uncomfortable heat to generate when sitting. then there's
4 I love this dress. it's an unusual material and really adorable in person. the problem was that it runs so large that i couldn't make it work. i'm usually an xs regular. the xs swallowed me. so then i ordered it in a pxs and pxxs because i really wanted it to work. only the pxxs fit, but it was so short that there was no way i could make it work. and i'm only 5'1". i am 51 years old so i am not comfortable wearing ultra short dresses. maybe a person who doesn't mind really short would be able to
1 I bought a pair of these in stone and after the first wash they become all splotchy. i chalked it up to perhaps there was bleach leftover in the my washer. although nothing else in the load was blotchy. i then, because i loved the cut of these pants, bought another pair in the darker blue color. the same thing happened after the first wash. again, nothing else in that wash load was the least bit ruined -- just my new retailer pants! such a bummer-- definitely a dye issue. i called the stores i pur
4 If i ever find something i can wear sans bra, i am pretty much going to buy it. just looking at this dress i wouldn't think it possible, but it is! this is a rare occurrence for me! honestly, the dress is a little tight a pulls a little bit across the chest (32d), but being able to go braless trumps that for me. hopefully it isn't too noticeable... i did find the straps to be extremely long, so i had them shortened. this dress is adorable and i've received so many compliments. it's so comfortabl
4 I'm a size 4 all day everyday. but, these pants wouldn't even meet around my hips. sadly, i'm returning them tomorrow.
4 I bought this shirt specifically for the extra details on the shoulder. when i received the shirt, it was a little stiffer than i expected but not enough to return it for being too uncomfortable.
4 Size down on this top. bought it online and when i took out of the packagei quickly put it back in. you could have put 4 of me in the xs. i think even an xxs would be huge. extremely boxy!! i recommend it only if you can find the correct size.
1 Bought two of these because i loved the way they fit off of the rack. washed them according to directions and they were ruined. the material shrank up making the shirt short and boxy and the side panels ended up being rippled. definitely going to try to return these.
4 This is a pretty, yet comfortable dress. perfect to wear to work or out to brunch with the girls.
4 Very nice design and color (beige). however, i am 5'1", 118# (athletic# and i thought the petite small was a bit too short #even for this cut) and just a bit too tight in the upper arms when wearing over a light-weight long sleeve dress. may work well over sleeveless. will see if a regular small fits better, but then the sleeves will be too long and not easily hemmed like the petite sleeves can be. the fabric is a bit felty for a boiled wool, but not a deal breaker.
4 The top is indeed a bit boxier than i was expecting, as the other reviewer found. it still looks good tucked in if you're concerned about it. the fact that it's sustainably produced in ghana was a big part of my desire to keep it too. really great to see designers producing clothing responsibly! i wish that how a garment is manufactured is highlighted more on this site because it definitely contributes to my purchases.
4 I purchased this dress on a whim. it is easy to wear and very comfortable.  the empire waist is flattering. however, the dress runs large and the lower half is a-line. the neckline is very flattering and you feel put together when wearing this dress.i am happy to have it in my wardrobe. a go-to piece for years to come.
1 Very disappointed. ordered two sizes, the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i wouldn't have worn it and the zipper was sticking. the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked. some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under $100 but at $228 they are not. returning both sizes.
4 It must be hard to photograph white clothing. this lovely top is almost invisible in the featured photo, but it is accurately photographed in the extra photo with the model in a jacket. this will feel and look great with cardigans or cropped, stylish jackets. i'm so glad i ordered this lovely, white, lacey top, and i do recommend it to you. i only dinged it one star because it would be even better in cotton and silk, which are frequent tiny brand materials. i went with the size large, as this be
4 I ordered size large in the denim color and tops like this are the reason i shop at retailer. this is such a sweet little floral, vertical, slimming, goes with anything print. the buttons down the front close with loops. it's easy to unbutton a few and pull this over your head. i'm a busty 34g and there's no gapping or pulling. the shirt arrived with the sleeves rolled and i had a heck of a time getting those tiny buttons into the cuff but once in, the cuff is wide enough to just slip your arm thr
4 This sweater is really pretty in person, and well-made. every time i wear it someone stops what they are doing to compliment it; one person asked if it was home-made( in a good way) i will admit that i would not have paid full price and did get it on sale, and in that case it's worth it. the sweater does have an unusual cut. the waist is boxy and the back is a bit shorter, but somehow it works. for me i see it as a cool style and not a mistake. it's super warm and i love it.
4 I consider this to be a flattering dress that is a good wardrobe staple since it can be dressed up or down and worn with a variety items (i.e. cropped denim jacket, oversized knit cardi, leather moto.) the twisty knot in the front is very cute and slimming and doesn't add bulk to my squishy squarish waist. this dress is tts to a bit large. the colors and material make this appropriate for autumn through spring. my only upset with this dress is the raw edges which cheapens the quality and makes m
4 I was looking for a velvet dress for the holidays. this one was beutiful in color and teksture.the only problem was that it was snug in the shoulders. going a size up would have made it too roomy elswhere.
4 I originally purchased this dress in a petite 6. i am 5'3", 125lbs with a 36" bust. the petite 6 was a bit too tight so i returned it and went up to a size 8. so happy i did! this dress drapes and flows beautifully and i find it immensely flattering to my hourglass figure. i also adore the floral print! one reviewer objected to the way the bodice drapes and the very small hook closure which seemed insufficient. i did not object to this characteristic. it fit me beautifully throughout the bodice/
4 I'm desperate for cute patterned shells to either layer or wear alone. i wanted this cute print to work - and it can, but it's just not great. the material is almost spandex-y, which is a bit weird. the only place it ran a bit small on me is the length of the straps, making the neck and the arms higher than i like. if i go up a size, it might be too much fabric and pleated swing around the waist. so close!
4 I read all the reviews before purchasing this and took the advice of others on sizing up. i am 5'4" hourglass shape (32d, 27 inch waist, size 28 pant size) and normally wear a size 4p in retailer dresses. i ordered a 6p and the top was way too big on me. i went straight to an retailer store to try on a 4 regular and the top half was perfect on me. a little too long for my liking (about an inch below my knee), so i re-ordered it in a 4p. this dress ran true to size for me. i recommend trying it on in
4 This top is very cute. it looks good with leggings, boyfriend jeans, and flare jeans. be careful, it will shrink. i bought an xs because other reviews said it runs large. it fit great, but i accidentally put it in the dryer and it shrunk. the sleeves that were already were fitted and not loose like the picture shows, shrunk so that they are a little snug on my arms. thankfully, it's still wearable because i do love it and have gotten several compliments on it.
4 This is a cute t with colors that blend with so many things i already have in my closet.and, i love the western theme which isn't at all girly. usually i purchase v-neck items becausethey suit me best, but i couldn't pass up the idea of cactus and succulents. it will be a funshirt to wear.
1 I was so looking forward to an awesome maxi dress.  this was not it.  completely see through.  i guess you could wear it as a bathing suit cover up.  but be prepared to knot the length or you will trip.  its an odd design. absolutely not worth the price.  i purchased the sm/md and i could have for two of me in the dress. returned this piece without looking back
4 I love the print on this. it's a super cute sweater, but i didn't think it worked so much for a 56 yr. old with a thickish middle. the med. was a bit snug but expect the large would've been too big (5'3", 150 lbs). a great statement piece for anyone with the figure to carry it.
4 Love this with leggings or jeans for a casual look. quality seems ok, though i'm hoping for no shrinkage after i wash since it's the perfect length at the moment (i'm 5'7" and it just covers my butt). good sale purchase!
4 Bought this for my brother's wedding and i just received it. i ordered my usual size xs. it's a tightly woven knit, with little to no stretch in it. i could barely get it over my head and my arms could barely fit in the sleeves. and i don't have big arms at all. for reference, i'm pushing 5'7", around 125 lbs. i'm glad it's so structured because i was worried that it would lose it's shape with this material make-up. but, no. it's really fitted. alas, i need to try again with the next size up. ma
4 This looks great on. i'm busty, so it's a little awkward to zip under the armhole, but not bad. a little bit tight in the bust, but the smocked back stretches to accommodate. i just wish the description had mentioned that it has silicone gripper across the front neckline. i have a sensitivity to this type of coating/elastic and generally avoid it, since it causes my skin to turn red and break out in blisters. the jumpsuit looks so great on that i will keep it and either remove the gripper or s
4 You will need to get these pants hemmed if you are not six foot tall, as they are quite long.  but they are so cute that the extra alteration expense is worth it.  imagine wearing pants that feel like pajamas but that look like a million bucks.  is this not every woman's fashion fantasy?
4 I absolutely adore this tunic, however, i followed the label and hand washed/hung dry and it shrunk! i was able to exchange it, so i will be taking it to a dry cleaner to see how it needs to be cleaned.for reference, i purchased a regular xs...i am 5'2", 120 lbs.
4 I love simple pull-on jersey dresses and so i had to try this one. unfortunately, it did not work out. fit is tts, i liked the fabric which is soft, silky yet with some weight to it, and i appreciated the thoughtful construction with multiple well placed darts in the chest. the skirt is lovely, swingy but not too full, hangs well. what stopped me from purchasing it is the fit in the shoulders, it was too broad for me and gave the dress an overall awkward shape. the neckline was also a little too
4 Great dress for a party or a more conservative event.  love the style and fit.  a little hard to get on and off...
4 I liked this sweater in the picture but was less impressed when i saw it in the store. it looked a bit odd and perhaps cheap to me. still i decided to leave it on my wish list and got it as a christmas gift. once i tried it on, i really liked the way it looked and felt! it's flattering, comfortable and looks great with jeans! it's really cozy! i rated it tts but you could almost size down on it.
4 Really pretty for summer, especially beach and pool wear. but i'm only 5'1 and even the petite is i think a tad long for flats (which is my preferred shoe for this dress). i'm also "curvy and busty on top, so unless you are blessed with a nice thin waist it's not as flattering as the tall thin model shows. but still it looks nice on, and i though it might look good also with white footless tights i have too. so i'm on the fence about keeping it, since it's really pretty for a summer party.
4 I liked this top even though it was a definite 'swing' style. i ended up altering it to remove some of the fullness.looks great with jeans as well as black pants for a dressier look. very soft and comfortable fabric. wish it was just a little bit longer.
1 I absolutely loved this top. it fit great and was easy to dress up or down. i wore it once and washed it according to the tag. cold water and flat dry. it is now 4 sizes too small and unwearable. extremely disgusted.
4 The sweater feels nice, but not as luxurious as some cashmere. for the sale price, it is worth it. found it a bit small, but still wearable. hopefully it will hold up well, as the zipper seems a bit delicate. overall it is a good basic piece.
4 I love t-shirts by t la, but unfortunately this particular one was different. the sizing was off. it ran small, although i ordered my usual size medium for this brand. i think the shirt is cute though;)
4 I love the button details on this top. i was expecting the material to be thicker, but it's quite thin. it isn't sheer, but i will layer it for the winter months. overall the fit is true to size. i am 5'0, 110 lbs and the xxs fit me well. the arms were more snug than shown on the model and the shirt was loose without being too flowy or boxy.
4 Wasn't sure about sizing so i ordered the xl and they fit my 5'3", 153 lb frame. they'd work for any height because they gathered quite a bit around my ankles but easily adjusted to look like they fit. amazingly, they don't show the squishy bits at all. it's a substantial thick knit. i'm returning because i don't have the body for these and i'm short waisted so the top, wide, slenderizing part of the waistband starts well above the area where i carry my weight in my tummy, mid section. i highly
4 This dress is really beautiful, but the fullness of the skirt made it a bit too precious for me. i liked that the neckline isn't too low, i could wear a bra with straps with it, the knee-length hem is perfect and the back is beautiful. but the skirt is really princessy. might work for a bridesmaid or an evening occasion but i found it too shiny and girly for less formal events.
4 I recently purchased this vest and unlike other reviews, i found it to be tts. with that being said, i am typically a medium in retailer tops or 8/10. i have broad shoulders (5'9, 145lbs). i purchased the medium and it fit perfect through the shoulders. it is meant to be flowy and gives some volume in a good way. if that's the look you are going for this is the top for you. had i gone down a size, i would not have been able to hook the top. i am going to be wearing this with blue jeans and white s
4 This dress is really fun and easy to wear all winter. the colors are really easy to pair and like the last reviewer mentioned, i love the sheer sleeves. i was very worried about the comfort of the fabric because most sweater dresses always fail. this dress is extremely comfortable to wear. it is not scratchy at all. it is soft and comfortable for winter even indoors with the building's heat blasting away. the dress will fit the size you normally wear, however it may show lumps and bumps. i would
4 I ordered this in size xl in the multi combo. the fit matches the photos. it's a strange sweater but i like it. i'm glad i got in on sale though. i'm pear-shaped and the curved hem fits me oddly. i like the longer length and the mix of blues/whites/peaches so i'm keeping it. it's not scratchy but also not soft. this is one of those purchases that i probably should return because i don't love it but i know i'll get enough use out of it to justify the sale price.
1 Really wanted to luv this top buttt it ran small in arm length & in the front, bottom...backside was perfect coverage...also most important this top is see-through! item as pictured is not accurate!
4 I bought this top to match a maxi skirt and it was pretty close to perfect.  i got the blue color,  which is more of a brighter blue than a navy.  i'm 6ft and wear a 10 top, but got this in a large hoping to gain some length in the torso out of the of a large and could have gone a size down.  the top was definitely long enough and i didn't have the problems with the gaping at the hook that other reviewers had. this is probably because i went a little larger in the sizing and i have a very small
4 This sweater was gorgeous, however, i think it was to boxy for my figure. it had to go back as it was not flattering.i would recommend this product to someone with a taller slimmer figure. i'm 5'6 145 lbs.
4 I like this top. another reviewer mentioned that it was a great top for a busty girl...i agree. i'm a 32g and could have sized down to a small, but i kept the medium because i wanted the extra length to have the option of wearing it as a dress. the small may have caused slight button pulling, but since the fabric has stretch and the top has a generous cut, it wouldn?t look insane. my only issue is the fabric pills. i wore the top once, and the fabric near the armpit pilled a lot, especially for
4 This dress is so comfortable and so sexy. hugs your curves. probably would not look great on an athletic frame. i bought on sale and was a good price. i usually wear a 2 or 4 in retailer, and the xs fit fine. the small was much too baggy.
4 Beautiful sweater that looks great with jeans.
4 This dress is stunning in person, though the pictures do it no justice. it was overall a very clingy fit. i'm 5'3 with long legs and it was too short for me so i did not purchase, but would recommend it for those with short legs.
1 I was so excited about this top, and so disappointed when it arrived today. the lace part is lovely, but the skirt part is a crinoline type fabric that balloons out at the sides. it is gathered at the sides rather than pleated, and there is no way to get it to lay flat. the back center section is pleated. why couldn't they have had the pleats all around? this will be going back with much regret.
4 I love the idea, and color, very flattrering and easy to trhrow on, however, i need the petite in this one, and they sold out in the neutral color. it looks too big in eregular sizing, and since it combines xs/s, it is made slightly bigger. material is soft enough.
4 The quality and design of this top is great and it goes well with my skinny jeans and wide-leg linen trousers. only thing is that it does need to air dry or i imagine it will shrink up which would not be good for taller frames. i'm slim, 5'8" and got an xs and it fits just right. the carbon color appears to have hints of blue/purple on screen, but it's actually a plain dark gray.
1 I have been continually disappointed in retailer's clothing for the past year. i feel like their prices have soared and the quality has remained so-so, but dresses like these somehow make the cut. it does not make sense. since when did retailer exclusively market to older women? no, retailer's market has always been young adults. this dress is extremely matronly. although the bottom print is nice, the hot pink belt?? is completely mismatched and gaudy. i really hope retailer starts curating better dress
4 Loved the idea of these as soon as i saw them!  great mid weight jean.  a little large in the waist.  the rhinestones sparkle and i received tons of complements when i wore these jeans!  great dressed up or down!
4 These pants are a fun way to mix it up from the usual dark, solid colored pants. the print is a perfect balance between subtle and bold. the fabric is soft and stretchy and i love that these pants are washable. i i'm petite (5'2") but my petite size was sold out so i bought these pants in the regular length. they are soooo long that i think even the petite size wouldn't have ended up cropped on me. having said that, i like them enough that i plan to keep them and have them shortened. i usually s
4 I loveeeeeeee this dress! i saw it online and immediately loved the blue/ orange large floral print but so did everyone else and it sold out quick. but i thought the shape could be flattering so i ordered in the black polka dot and loved the shape! so flattering. i ended up going in store and buying the other two colors. the patterns are vibrant and lovely shape. my only concern was seeing it in store i noticed it stretching while just hanging on the hanger. i wish the fabric was of better quali
4 This coat is a perfect fall to winter transition coat. it is surprisingly warm in 50 degree weather, so i'm sure it will be warm enough in 30-40 degree weather with some added layers. the only thing to note is that it is unlined and the material is soft so it may be prone to pilling. can be worn casually, to work, and dressed up.
4 This is a beautiful top if you size way down. i normally wear a small in tiny tops. i had to buy an xxs petite in this top. even still there is a little extra material around the sides, but i've received a ton of compliments on the top.
4 Cashmere is soft as a feather, yet warm, easy to wear and the pointelle stitches are lovely. i feel lovely wearing this and i'm really not that kind of "lady". so, if you imagine a side of yourself wanting to try out feeling lovely, bite the bullet and buy this cardigan. it does run small in my bust area, but all the rest fits well.
4 This dress is really lovely and the quality seems excellent. the bodice of the dress fits tight and that is why i knocked off one star. i am a 34 a 5'6" and 123 lbs., ordered the 2, my usual size. the top part is very snug and it hugs tightly around my neck which i don't like. i may try going up a size but it fits so perfectly everywhere else. the length is perfect it just touches the ground, no need to hem it even with flats. the color may be a bit more of a peachy color in person but overall t
4 Wouldn't have given them a second look but tried them on in store of a whim. love, love!!
4 This fabric and quality of the skirt are superb- there is a pretty metallic thread detail in the fabric that isn't easy to see online. however, the skirt is quite puffy, which i suppose could be good for someone with a boyish figure looking to add curves. but for many of us the extra puff might not be welcome. one would want to wear it with a tight fitting top and emphasize a small waist in order to counterbalance the volume of the skirt. could be a nice buy for the right person, just be aware o
4 So simple to throw on with jeans, or you could dress it up. the ruffles give it a little extra flair. nice and soft, really comfy. i haven't decided which size i am going to hold onto. i ordered in a small and a medium. small fits me great, and i am usually a pretty standard medium. i think it just depends on what look you are going for.  wish they had it in a lighter color, like an ivory or pink.  i think the ruffle detail would look nice with a lighter shade.
4 I'm going on a cruise to the bahamas and when i saw this dress, i had to have it! i love it! it's soft to the touch and super fun to twirl around in! the seams are a bit awkward and that's due to the bottom part's shape. i have a slender navy blue belt that i pair it with to hide the waist seam and to accent my waist more. a navy blue sash/scarf/ribbon around the waist can do the trick too!
4 This vest is soft, flattering, and versatile. but both pockets were sewn incorrectly, with broken seams on the bottoms so if you used them, things would fall out. i'm keeping it but had to pay a seamstress to fix it. for the price, i'd expect better quality. recommended conditionally..
4 I am so glad i found this tee. as usual i love bordeaux rayon-spandex shirts. the fabric is soft and comfortable. it's heavy enough to drape nicely contouring your natural curves. it does not cling to the body, is just loose enough to let you breathe during the hot summer days. i was afraid it would look like a swing tee and make me look like i am pregnant but it doesn't. it runs true to size. the only complaint i have is that the back runs too long.
4 I bought these stretchy skinny cords in my usual size 28 (31 waist, 33 low waist, 38.5 hip/butt).  they are comfortable and long enough for my 5' 9" frame.  i hope they don't shrink.  the flower pattern on all the pairs in the store has the flowers running down the inside and outside of my legs.  the dark part runs down the middle.  i wish it was like the picture on the model, with the print running right down the front and backs of the legs, dark parts on inner and outer thigh.
4 Cute top, a little less fitted than i was expecting.
4 I tried this on in store yesterday and didn't buy it due to the dolman style sleeves and the scratchy lace.  dolman sleeves look terrible on me, so this was a no go.  beware the scratchy lace...i had this on for about 2 minutes and was itching.  otherwise, this will wok for plenty of people - the color can be a nice neutral.  it does run large - i usually wear a large and sized down to a medium.  it didn't work for me, but i'm sure some will find it a nice part of their wardrobe.
1 This looked like a simple, chic blouse, but the fabric felt cheap to me, like thin lining fabric. the neckline is too deep and wide as well and so not flattering.
4 Very cute. love the animals on it, especially the bunnies! however not sure about fit. fits perfectly at waist but fabric expands a bit further down; it seems to billow/puff/bag in lower part, not at bottom but in the stomach area, like there is too much fabric. so it fits, but also looks like there's something slightly off. interested in hearing other's opinions about this. also i am slightly und 5 ft. there'no petite option but the standard stops slightly above my knees so length seems ok.
4 What a great top!! unusual design
4 I bought this in size xl and it initially fit me similarly to the model. but, once i washed it (in cold in my machine, reshaped and air-dried), it was so much smaller/shorter. i loved the embroidery on the top. the mix of pattern colors is great too. i like when blues and blacks are mixed together. i don't know how i could have prevented the shrinking. i now throw on a shrug or jacket over to hide the shorter length. still stylish and fun.
1 This dress didn't work for me at all. i'm 6ft tall, 160lb, i usually wear size l 8/10, but based on the reviews i ordered an m. the material of this dress is very soft and fuzzy, color is about the same as pictured, also length is appropriate. dress is very thick and warm, the fabric however has no stretch at all, dress is very specious and shapeless. there is allot of room everywhere except shoulders & sleeves, i thought that area was tight & snug which is strange because it runs large everywhe
4 I usually wear a 4 in maeve, and purchased this is a 6 in the orange. i'm just over 5'7", 34c, size 26/27 jeans. through the bust and arms the 6 fits great. i still found the front to be just a tad shorter than i am comfortable. it hangs well, though, if not a bit loose. definitely more billowy and boxy feeling in person. i think if it were slightly fitted through the waist, the length wouldn't be an issue. and it isn't even that much of an issue, but i did knock off a star for that reason. i bo
4 I'm 5'2 and based on some other reviews i opted for the regular rather than petite and am glad i did. even the regular is kind of short. if i raise my arm(s) all the way up, skin is typically exposed. i originally ordered a medium and i liked the fit everywhere except for the chest. i'm a 34dd and i felt like i couldn't move my arms. i exchanged it for a large to sacrifice some of the fit for some more arm movement. the cut is already a bit boxy so having it a bit boxier with more arm movement w
4 For a special occasion, but i didn't keep mine:i ordered petite and it was short on me, too short for my comfort color is nice, rsty burgundy, i expected it a little more 'red"fastening is a little more complicated, though you don't have to make it complicated, it has hooks at each end of the hole in the back,.but: it is a nice cut, flattering to the silhouette, i might order a regualr size if i needed it. the body is structured, mateiral is not stiff, but also not soft. the arms is
4 /my friend and i both tried on this shirt just to see how it fit and because it was blue. we were surprised how pretty it si on. a little see-through though, but hte cut hits in the right places (i guess we are not too endowed). she ended up buying it so i passed but very feminie work piece.
4 This dress is really pretty, but not made for girls with hips. i tried on my usual size 6 and it fit everywhere but was just slightly too tight in the bum for me to feel comfortable, but i feel like i would have been swimming everywhere else in the dress in an 8 (typical of shifts i guess, but a girls can dream!). if you are a straighter shape, though, i would highly recommend.
4 This was my first time to try this brand and they fit so well and are super comfortable. i love the pockets also. i am 5'1, 108 and i got a 2p and they fit just right.
1 Contrary to the first review, there is a zipper so while it wasn't easy to get on, it did fit over my bust. i found this too small and high waisted, and i already have a high waist so i can imagine it looking empire waisted on a normal torso. what i hated was the ridiculous inverted pleat in the front of the dress which is almost impossible to see in the online photo. it made my already busty frame even wider and more unflattering. the lining was nice and soft and the sleeve length and hemline l
4 In that i'm on the busty-side, i thought, "surely an xl will not be too large." ah contraire. wanted it in crimson anyway, so will try it in a large. the fabric in the white is nice in that it is substantial enough not to see-through. will look most interesting under a sweater or jacket.
4 Nice length in tall.  order up one size: cut slim in body.  fabric lightweight bordering on flimsy.
4 A very nice fall into winter tunic. length is long enough to wear along line as a dress with tights and tall boots. i found it true to size. the color of slate blue is beautiful!
4 Nicer twist on the casual tshirt. soft, comfy. love the purple.
4 Got this in the red, like previous reviewer mentioned - it does fit snug.you might need to size up if you are busty and want a much looser fit.other than that, super comfortable and soft fabric
4 Definitely order down a size. i am almost always an xl (big chest, broad shoulders) but the l in this fits me perfectly. well worth the sale price, a fun boho transition piece!it is a "reverse print" so the inside is brighter than the outside, but i like the blurred paisley print--it's subtle.the back detail is great and very flattering.it is quite full and flowy, but in a flattering way, i think. just restrained enough.
4 These give an amazing slimming effect and i love the dark wash and fit on the waist. only negative is that being 5'4 and a size 30 the length of the pants is a few inches too long for me. i still love them but will have to wear heels with them always.
4 Beautiful dress! i usually wear a size 4 regular, or a 6 petite (if the dress has sleeves). i ordered this in the 6p and it is too big. wish i could exchange it for a 4p, but it's no longer available.
4 I love the fit of this tee for everyday wear. it's forgiving on my late 30s mom body and looks much more stylish than the average tee. my only complaint is that the fabric started pilling on the second wear. otherwise the fit, style, and fabric weight are great. it fits tts. i'm usually a size 4 and the small fits perfectly.
1 The shirt is beautiful, but fits much too small. the stitching limits the space in your shoulders, and the hem too short. a petite frame would be able to pull this off- but i am a 5.10" medium, and the shirt didn't work in every direction.
4 These pants are made of a beautiful fabric that really brings out the rich color. like others have said they fit almost like high-waisted leggings, which i for one love. it makes them really comfortable while the nice, heavy fabric and lovely tailoring make it appropriate for an office. i do find that the pockets are pretty useless, as having anything in them ruins the lines of the trousers. the zipper is a bit pokey as well.
4 I bought this in two colors : the green which i love and the washed out look adds some interest to make this other than a plain tank. i also bought this in white and it is completely see through. i will never understand why designers don't pay attention to how fabric would look as soon as you put a bra on. if you want to wear a tank under your tank then get the lighter colors otherwise i would stick with the green.. honestly debating on whether to buy the bright blue color but i fear it's just n
4 This bra is just as cute in person as it is in the pic! i can tell it's pretty well made and i love that it has a lot of little details like on the straps and the cute front-closure and lacy racerback. it also fits pretty true to size, which is a must for me because i often get bras that leave my boobs spilling out. however, this bra isn't the comfiest even though it looks like it would be pretty comfy in the picture.the style doesn't look too stiff or anything and the size i got isn't too tight
4 I liked the way the dress looked in the front, but the material in the back was knit and very clingy. i did not think it was flattering on me.
4 I have about 3 or 4 akemi & kin tops. i usually take a small. i think this one runs a bit bigger. the armholes are too deep and there is just too much fabric for me. (5'6" 125lbs) i am going to try to size down because i really like everything else about the top. orange is not my color but this has enough white to compensate. the pattern, button detail and fabric are all very nice.
1 I wish i had read the other reviews before purchasing this product. label says that you can wash and dry normally. however, upon washing, the outer layer shrunk and the inner lining did not. the robe will now not lay flat; the fabric pulls at the edges, and results in the inner lining being revealed when the robe is tied shut. extremely disappointed. for a $100 garment, i expected much more. i wish i could return this.
4 I bought the delaney blazer in size 6 -- and i really like it. there are surprising design elements which make it a unique piece -- the buttons of the sleeves are mismatched, the back material is different from the front, it has some exposed seams. like others have said it does have a boxy fit -- which i don't mind. i also found it to be a bit short. if both of these things are fine for you, the blazer is a great addition to a casual-creative professional look.
4 I ordered these in my usual pilcro petite size 6. they were impossible to button, which is interesting 'cause i also ordered the pilcro wide leg chinos in the same size and they fit perfectly, as usual. but it ended up being ok because i don't care for the speckled, slightly rough material or the contrasting piping. back they go!
4 Perhaps i purchased the wrong size. i will return to a store and try on the small. the medium just looks a little sloppy on me. i absolutely love the length and the color. will likely exchange for a smaller size and wear it all spring and summer.
4 The color and weave of this sweater is really beautiful and it looks very expensive. it is heavy- this is not a lightweight cardigan so save it for the coldest of days! i wore with a white tee like in the picture and jeans, and i did have to roll the sleeves up like the model. i'm not sure that i have a jacket that would fit over this sweater because it is somewhat bulky, but i am still very happy with the purchase. you could wear this at home to lounge in, or out and about for casual outings.
4 Love this! easy to dress up and down, has a great length on the torso but the sleeves are about 2-3 inches from my wrist bone, i see why the model has them pushed/rolled up- which is how i wear the shirt now too. but then it's hard to layer under a coat.
4 I wanted to love this top. unfortunately, the color & fit didn't work for me. i'm a 36ddd. the fit was ok, it even flattered my bust, i just felt the stripes didn't flatter my waist. this would be perfect for an athletic frame.
4 Love this dress and its versatility! great design concept. fabric is pretty soft, cozy, and warm, as well. i found the dress to run large. i ordered a medium in the gray and small in the rose. i did like both colors irl, but the size small was the best fit. for reference, i'm 5'6", 135 lbs, and wear a 6. the size small hit just above my knees and the sleeves reached down to my knuckles. i wore this around the house for awhile and realized that while the knit was nice and tight when i first put i
4 But i thought this was lace or with texture, it is more a pattern on regular fabric.colors are nice, there are subtle flowers with bright colors in the pattern, the fit is nice, the 0p fit snugly enough, i don't think there was much give but that was comfortable enough. petite length did end below the knee as shown. i think it would have been nicer shorter but don't want to have to pay extra to ehm so i left that one behind...maybe on sale :-)
4 I bought this recently after trying on both the small and xs. for reference, i'm small-framed, 5'3", 120 pounds, size 4 in most clothes, but can't wear petite sizes, usually a small or medium in retailer tops. i liked the fit and length of the small but the armholes were so big you could see the whole side of my bra. no one wants to see anyone's bra, not even their bra straps. i'd worn a white cami in under my tee that day, so i put it on and it improved the side view, but i didn't like the white
4 I'm petite, short waisted and slim hipped but with broad shoulders. the byron lars pencil dresses fit me perfectly so i was hoping this pencil dress would too (though with this brand my sizing fluctuates). unfortunately, the cut of the shoulders made me look like i had hammy arms. it was a little tight around the waist area and i could have probably gone up a size for a better fit width wise. length wise, however, it would have been too long for my torso, which i run into a lot. too bad.
4 I ordered both a small and a medium because i have lost weight and seem to be in between sizes currently. lately i am anywhere from a 6 to a 10 in most retailer sizes. almost 5'4" and @140 lbs. i could have gotten away with the small. but my bust size is 36c/d. the small fit but didn't hang as well or feel as comfortable around the chest as the medium. i agree with a previous reviewer that this romper does have a tendency to hang awkwardly at the waist until and unless you pull the drawstring tigh
4 Very pretty top. runs a bit large (i generally take an xs and the xs in this top fits me a little longer and larger than on the model). comfortable and easy to wear. nice cut with angled front and bit longer back. did develop a small hole very quickly as some thinner and tissue tees do but hoping that's unusual as i did buy two different colors of this tee shirt and will be totally disappointed if this happens to both, especially at this price.
4 This is a beautiful blouse however it runs big. i order the small and had to return it. my measurements are 5'4 135 34c-28-38 for reference. you will not regret buying this blouse but it has to be the right size if not it would look like it did on me, frumpy. i kept taking it off and putting it back on trying to make it work (because i liked the material that much) but if you look at the model she has her arms straight down. when i lifted my arms i had 3 inches of extra material on both side. th
4 ...there's enough room for a small family to live under the chest and trunk area of the blouse! sorry-had to say that! all kidding aside-since it's been thirty plus years ago since we were wearing these, many of us have forgotten what peasant blouses truly fit like. this is no exception- it is very billowy, flouncy, and roomy-more so even than today's peasant styles, i think. it is lovely and quite fitted across the chest -so that's how i ordered my size and it worked. i think if one sizes down
4 I purchased this top in both colors while on sale. it fits true to size. the material is heavier than i expected, but that just means it should hold up for a long time. recommend
4 At 5'4" i typically order petite clothing...i was unsure of this dress/tunic-shirt from the photos online, the reviews and the hi/low hem. i ordered xs and pxs (about 118#). both fit as far as shoulders and through the body but the pxs was way too short on me to wear as a dress without any leggings. the length of the regular xs works great and i feel is appropriate for someone my age! it is buttery soft and so comfortable. i ordered the suede wrap belt to go with it. also, the sleeves are too ti
4 I tried this skirt in my usual size s, and although it fit, it was too short for my liking and made my hips look wide b/c of the way it billowed out. the size m looked much better- hit me right below the knee in the front. (i'm 5'2") my skirt is much more high-low than the picture. also, it sits much lower on my waist, which i like. i bought the blue, and with the color variations, it is gorgeous- reminds me of a chambray or denim coloring. i rolled it up to take on vacation, and it traveled rea
4 I'm not nearly as tall as the model so these hit right just right for flats. i love the fit of the wide leg and found the color matching the photo and the light color cords very soft. i did try the blue color on at a different store and found them a bit short. i'm really pleased with these and the sale on sale certainly helped.
4 I tried this in the black and white in the store. the material is very thin. you cannot wear the white without a cami which defeats the purpose of wearing this tank in the summery. the arm holes are cut very inconsistently. some are very big which creates a very unflattering gap under the armpit. others are cut fine. i tried on 3 different smalls in the black and found one that was cut just right. this does fit snuggly, but is more flattering that way.
4 I love the beautiful flowy material and design. definitely runs a bit large. i ordered an xs and it needs to be taken in as well as taken up. i would have ordered the petite if it wasn't out of stock, so the length is probably fine for most. shimmery detail is beautiful.
1 This is the worst shirt i have ever tried on from retailer. it is basically a big shaggy box from the front, and from the side it looks like a tent. it is also short.
4 I love this sweater but i'm on the fence about keeping it only because i haven't figured out a way to layer and wear it. it really does appear best with a plain white top and jeans. i've tried it with several other things in my closet and just haven't found another combination that sells it for me - i really like my pieces to be more versatile so i can mix and match them into other outfits. this piece is just enough of a "statement" that - for me - wearing it with more simple clothing staples is
1 This is adorable but if it truly has to be dry-cleaned that is deal killer
4 Great boho chic top. a bit over - sized but soft and love the colors!
1 I couldn't wait to get this top in the mail since they didn't have it at my local retailer, but i was so disappointed in both the quality and fit. the white is completely see-thru, i can't believe how sheer the material is - especially for the price. even as the shirt is lying down, i can see through both layers of it... the fit runs small, and short.
4 I love the built in layers of this shirt. it looks great layered with a long sleeved shirt underneath for winter also. being a teen in the 90s, it reminds me of a little bit of grunge, but in a less brooding more classy way. if only i still had my doc martins... i find the fit to be great, slightly loose, but not baggy and the fabric feels light but not fragile.
4 Great layering top! love the color- grey striped, matches almost anything. the sizing is perfect and the material is nice and think but not so chunky that it adds pounds to your frame. interesting detail with the snap neck looks sporty and jeeps it from being just another basic turtleneck.
4 Just picked this up in black in the store. on the hanger it looks like just another v-neck tank, but it is quite flattering on. however, the v-neck is quite exaggerated and loose, i will be pinning it so it doesn't sag open. :)
4 It's a cute top. i agree with the other poster that the neck in the front feels a little restrictive.
4 The embroidery is gorgeous! it's a lovely blouse--soft, lightweight, and of quality material. the only problem is that it is an oversized fit--running at least one or two sizes too large. it is enormous! i ordered it online but will return it and shop for a much smaller size in the store to guarantee proper fit.
4 I have always love tracy reese products. this blouse is really fun, nice fabric and the proportions are perfect. but why does it have to show the wide band of my bra across my back? the cut out dips low so i can't imagine a bra that would work with it. it's a 70's hippy themed blouse- maybe the designer expects us to go braless? unfortunately i'm going to have to wear a cami underneath it. my girls need support!
4 This dress is just lovely. beautiful drape, comfortable material. it is a print that looks like embroidery. i am usually an xs or s, and i'm glad i got the xs as i can tell the s would have been too large. the back waistband is elastic and it is easy to move in. beautiful neutral colors. i think it can be dressed up or down easily with the right shoes and jewelry. only negative comments- there is only a half slip and i wish it was lined more, although that will make it easier to wear during the
4 I tried on the xs and the shoulder are fit, but the body seemed so wide on me, it took me over... i don't know if xxs would have worked, but it is not available (and petite either). fabric is soft enough for denim, color is nice, overall, really pretty dress, just unfortunately big.and i have wide shoulders.30dd chest, 26.5 in wasit, big legs, 115 lbs.
4 I love this dress! my bra straps do not show in the back. you can slightly see them in the front but wearing black or nude gets you around this problem. i love the slim design-it is very flattering. i tried this is my normal size 4 but also the 4 petite. the petite did not work for me since there is a larger fabric cutout for the butt area-this was too high and above my natural waste. because of this, i opted for the slightly longer option where the extra fabric was surrounding my bum. this does
4 I wanted to love this. the color in the picture is pretty true-to-life. the top fit well, if a bit smaller than usual, but the skirt piece was way too flared for my petite (5') frame. it was too voluminous compared to the top of the dress. the material is very soft, but thin, and is lined, which was a pleasant surprise. sadly, a return for me.
4 Easy to wear, get lots of compliments when i wear it. can be dressed up or down
4 Picked this darling vest in a medium. i have been eyeing for sometime but really did not want to pay full price, after checking other manufactures i came back to this vest at retailer. as the other reviewers mentioned, the softness, spec of colors which enables you to wear the vest with so many colors in bottoms and tops; the pockets, the belt, which i love as much as the pockets, though the faux fur collar i do wish was removable. the faux fur will limit me in getting away with wearing this vest
4 I normally wear a large but this had no give through the bust! beware big chested girls!!!
4 Nice quality, can work as a jacket or sweater. i've worn with and without the tie. i didn't realize from the pictures but the sleeves bell out giving it an extra touch.
4 The material of this dress is really thick and substantial. very soft and it has good movement. the cut was not quire right for my body, unfortunately. but on the right person, this would be very nice. i think a lot of different body types would look great in this dress, depending on where the waist hits etc.
4 This sweater is beautiful and stylish, but unfortunately it sheds a bit. considering the sale price, it's still worth it so i won't return it.
4 This dress worked well on me (not too curvy). it's fitted and enhances curves in a nice way. the patterns looked nice, too.
4 Cute design. details on shoulder make the tshirt more special but it runs large so that kind of takes away from the styling. got it on super sale, so i'll keep it. maybe a wash will shrink it a bit...
4 I tried this jacket on in store, both m & l. both seemed to pull a little at waist/pocket (notice the raised pleat on the closeup. i ordered xl on line. it fits better but still seems to fit like the other two when fastened. snaps seem to be misplaced. on the plus side, the style is cute and there is brown (taupe) mixed in with the grey which is more flattering to brownettes. there isn't much difference in sizing of all three. i am not sure whether this is a keeper. open, it is fine and casual;
4 I sized up to an xl and although they have everything you want in a yoga/lounge pant, they just didn't thrill me enough to keep them. they're soft, warm and comfy but i didn't care for the bulk or fit of the foldover waistband. and they were too long so i returned. if you're built like the model, you'll love these.
4 This is a very pretty sweater and the neutral color works well with everything. the detail in the back makes it unique. it runs large though, so size down. the sleeves by the cuffs do tend to stretch out easily, but it washes well, so it's not a big issue..
4 I bought these to go with the boiled wool jacket that is also currently on sale. i have several pairs of charlie trousers, and i really like the brand. these are in a thicker "winter fabric" and i understand why the other reviews found them itchy. i don't find that bothersome, but the texture is a bit different. the quality is typical for charlies. the color stripe is a metallic bronze, but could look pink in the right light. the fabric is noticeably stretchy--i think without that stretch, these
4 This top/jacket is less red than it appears in the pictures - more of a wine color (as it is labeled) but it is pretty and the gold details are nice.
4 I got this in blush pink and the details are very pretty. the dress is wide, might have a tailor bring it in on the sides, but its very comfortable and i like that it covers my arms a bit, but still keeps you cool.
4 My daughter bought this sweater in xs in white and i tried it on. it was a little too tight but long enough to wear with leggings so i ordered the red in a s. it just covers my butt in the back - not nearly as long as my daughter's. i still love the sweater and will wear it with jeans but it is way too short to wear with leggings. i don't understand how there can be such a difference in the same sweater - a size larger and at least 4 inches shorter! if not for that, i would have rated it a 5.
4 I love this sweater. i didn't buy it the first time when i tried it at the store because the buttoned look created a bulk on one side and i thought that this was very weird. it might have been what i was wearing underneath that day or that particular sweater. but then at 40% off i decided to give it another try and i'm happy that i did. i bought the navy and i love the feel of the material. sizing down makes all the difference, too. i wasn't fan of the attached sleeves at first as they are made
4 Purchased in white. very pretty top. i thought it would be more lace - but non the less, it is lovely.
4 I love a good gaucho/ culotte. these are very comfortable and fit is tts (i'm 5'9" 145 and wear a 29). they are ironed with a line down the front, which i don't like, as it's always hard for me to keep the ironing straight. the pants have a little bit of stretch to them which is nice. since they're linen, they will require frequent ironing (which, i hate to do in the summer).
4 I wanted this top to work so bad. unfortunately the way the bust of the top is designed it isn't flattering if you aren't flat chested. it squishes on side of your chest and leaves the other side alone. i'm a b cup and had this problem so if you are a b or larger, i don't recommend. however, if you are smaller busted, this piece would be worth the purchase.
1 I should have read the reviews first before ordering this top/!. ***buyers beware**: you will not get the same top delivered to you, as is shown in this picture. the top i got delivered does not have the little straps at all, and while there is a bow in the back, the back sides do not come together the same to form the bow. i hate to write a bad review, but come on retailer! i'd never expect this from you. it looks like any other peplum white top, not something special like the picture is o
4 The dress is lovely. my only knock on it is i didn't really feel like the top and the skirt matched in terms of level of dress. i guess the top just wasn't "fancy" enough for me. but it is a very beautiful skirt. i wish it was in a tea length. the fit was spot on.
4 I wasn't sure what size to get in this and how it would fit since there weren't any reviews but i ordered it in a size 10 and it fits really well. i usually get dresses in a size 8 but those flow a bit more and this on my waist (am curvy on bottom) i needed to get the 10, it sits well on my waist and i don't have to hike it up. the material is chino like so it does get a bit wrinkled but it has a nice weight and the pleats give it a pretty flow not too boxy making my hips look bigger. it has bel
4 The skirt really is beautiful - the blue and coral are brighter in person than in the picture above. it's a nice lightweight material that feels quality, but has too much stretchy spandex in it for my tastes. i had the same problem as others - the skirt runs very small. i am usually a size 6, and while i could zip the 6 up, the skirt had those puckers that come from being a size too small.
4 Good design, comfortable fit. however, sizing is way off. i am a 34c and the small fits with minimal support. agree with the previous review. not sure it is a keeper.
4 I read all the previous reviews and wasn't sure what to think. when i saw it on sale at my local retailer store, i decided that, despite the thin fabric, it was worth getting. i love the quote spoken by audrey hepburn in the movie "sabrina" and knew i just needed to add a cami underneath. i bought it two days ago and wore it yesterday with a short sleeved open sweater, so the quote showed. i got two compliments on it within a short time! for reference, i am 5'9" and 150 lbs. i bought a large and i
4 I ordered one of the xl in the red version. the fit is true to size. it matches the model's photos. the color is much prettier in person. it looks washed-out on my computer. but, in person, it's a nice light red. the quality of the material is okay. not as good as with the floral version of this style (florascura tank). the layers are flattering for my pear-shape. it definitely needs a tank underneath though. not worth full-price in my opinion but worth getting on sale.
4 I bought these pants expecting to lounge around the house in them. but once i tried them on, they were so figure flattering that i wore them to an outdoor dinner party (paired with a black tank top, silver accessories, and wedges) and got compliments galore. i still wear them to lounge in (they are super comfy) but they are also my emergency "oh we're going out tonight, honey?" pants. the only downside is that they need ironing when you pop them out of the wash (unless you are using them to loun
4 This skirt is figure flattering and stylish, while still being work appropriate. i like the length as well.
4 I love the style of this coat and the way it fits on the model. in reality, the cut is more straight. i was hoping for some darting and a slimmer silhouette. cinching the belt makes the coat bunch unattractively. if i sized down, i think it would look better but i'm concerned that my shoulders will not fit. the fabric is 60% poly/40% wool and a bit itchy where it's not lined. the lining is a jersey poly blend. the belt has flimsy ugly string loops that cheapens look of the coat. other than the b
4 These have an amazing fit! i have them in three colors. they are not too low rise, they are not too high. they are the perfect length. the only thing i do not like is the rolled cuff is not stitched and comes down easily if you do not iron down.
4 I'm 5'1", <100 lbs. xs fits surprisingly well. the sleeves were rolled up when it arrived so i didn't noticed they were long. the wrinkled appearance looks fun and casual. the big drawback is that the interior seams poke and scratch my skin when i wore it over a halter top. even over a tee it was irritating in one spot. despite that, love it enough to keep.
4 Very cute and comfy dress. i'm 5'6" and 117 pounds and the xs worked great. it is meant to fit big and comfy so don't expect a tailored dress. looks great with tights and boots and i love that you can turn it around to make it a cardigan!
4 I love this sweater coat. i just put on a pair of leggings and boots and i'm good to go. it's warm and flattering and comfortable and i can wear it anywhere, it works at the office, out to eat, shopping or even just hanging around.fit: some of the other comments mention the small waist. this is a fitted sweater, not a roomy piece for layering over other pieces. i like the fit because i get the warmth of a big sweater without the bulk. the fit is similar to dresses that i have purchased at anth
1 This reminded me of big bird in person and just adds volume to your body. i'm thin and usually wear a size 0, so i'm not sure who this may look good on.
4 I ordered these in a size small on sale, thinking that because of the material, they might not fit. they are actually very cute, and fit in the waist/legs, but in the crotch area, as another reviewer mentioned, they could fit a little better. they look fine with a longer top so i decided to keep them.
4 I love the look and design of these pants. i'm 5'1, 110lbs and i ordered a 25p and still had to get them hemmed to even fit like pants. on the model, these look cropped but mine were even too long to be pants when i got them. i love the pant but if you are a petite, be ready to need alterations to the length!!
4 This is a lovely sweater but i wished i had ordered the xs (only the small was left).
4 I love the way this t-shirt fits. the horseshoe opening in front is deep enough to add interest, but not too revealing. will look great with layered, dainty necklaces. the sleeves are nice and long - and i have long arms. the length of the shirt itself could be an inch or two longer, but overall the design is nice. not too tight, not too loose. i'm 5' 5" and 125 lbs - 34c and the small fits me well. fabric is medium weight - could be a little thicker. the brick color is nice and works great with
4 This is a beautiful coat and the fit and weight are perfect. my only hesitation in giving it 5 stars is that the lapel's don't lay perfectly flat. i read some complaints about the placement of the button but it doesn't bother me. otherwise it's a gem and i'm going to keep it.
4 I love designs that are flowy/drapey in the front, so this hits the mark when tied in the back. has lots of visual interest. but i agree with the other reviewers.. the slip is super small. dress fits true to size, if not a bit large but the slip is one full size smaller. and you must wear a slip. overall, i'm pleased with the look.
4 I love this skirt. the material is soft and beautiful. i love wearing it with black tights and boots. the skirt is quite a bit longer than how it appears on the model, however (unless the model is 10 ft tall!). i am 5'2" and if i place the skirt under my ribs, it reaches right above my knee. it works though and doesn't look bad. i would still recommend you buy this!
4 Beautiful top but disappointed that the top was so sheer. i'm 5"2, 120 and i ordered my usual xs. fit perfectly but may exchange for a s as i was hoping for it to be a little longer (hits right below my waist).
4 These pants are so fun. i love the pattern and color. can be dressed up or down. very flattering.highly recommend trying them on, they were better than i expected them to be
4 Very flattering, the material is not the softest but it's an easy one to throw on with jeans
4 I like the pointelle feature in the front. i end up wearing a lot of black, but this at least gives me the option to do a bit of color underneath if i so chose. i've worn this with white, black and blue jeans w/ boots. looks great. i'm 5'3" and 125 lbs. i got a medium, but i could have possibly gone with a small. my only complaint is that it might be a tad bit too long. since i'm on the shorter size, i can't imagine it would be too much of an issue for others.
4 I ordered this coat in a size xs during the promo. it just arrived & is too big. sleeves way too long & big under the arms. it's labeled xs but looks more like a m. i don't mind an oversized fit & having the sleeves altered but this is just not working. if petite were available it may work for me. it is nicely made, soft, comfy, button front which i prefer instead of snaps. i think it wld be super cozy on a cold day. love the print! i am of small build, 5'3", 115#, usually a xs-s, occas petite.
4 I was looking for a red and black plaid top with a twist, and this tee definitely fits the bill! i plan to wear this shirt with a long sleeve tee under it for extra warmth for casual holiday events, and can see it with a skirt and cardi for work. fabric is soft and comfortable. fit is loose but not too boxy.
4 Just got this vest in my store yesterday and i was immediately drawn to it. the outside of the vest is this thick knit in an oatmeal color and a bright cobalt blue (even brighter than it appears online). the inside is a jersey knit fabric in grey. its an eye catcher for sure. i knew i needed to try it on. the vest is longer in length (like it appears in the photos). my only gripe is the fit. its great around the neck...nice and full. but i wish the body of the vest was larger. it fits very much
1 I was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for spring/summer. for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses. the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all. the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown. this dress has no shape to it, although probably comfortable, not flattering. i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture, in person.
1 I was very excited to receive this dress because of the cute photo. however, upon arrival i was completely disappointed. the color is much more drab than the photo. the smudged polkadots weren't attractive. there were many little bumps and pulls in the linen. the dress is super heavy. the pleats around the waist did not lay correctly.and it adds 10 pounds to your hips! super sad! i am sending it back.
4 These pants run small by two sizes or so. nice material, color true to picture.
4 Fit tts, very flattering and slimming with fitted thighs and slight flare. can be dressed up given the beautiful and classy dark wash. the hint of stretch makes them super comfortable. the only thing is, they are very long, will have to hem unless you are 6 ft tall. in my 5'5 case i'm afraid the hemming will take away some of the flare effect. ag, please make pants with realistic length! still, very happy, especially since i was lucky to get my size during a promo.
1 Yikes. there is a whole lot of skirt here. i am 5"4, weigh around 120 lb, and usually wear anywhere between a four and six in retailer clothing, depending on the designer. this skirt balloons out from the waist. on the website it seems to flow more naturally from the waist. i think that the flowers are cute but the material is cheap looking. the skirt is very long- hitting way below mid-calf. there is also tons of material - creating a parachute effect. definitely returning.
4 This dress is stunning. i loved the cut and seam detailing. it is very flattering...if it fits. i have a curvy athletic build and usually wear a size 10/12. i am also smaller busted and this dress was too tight around my ribs, back and tummy. i bought the large and it doesn't' come in a bigger size :( it is very well made and completely lines. i highly recommend this dress but again only it if fits you.
4 Love this dress! it's a little roomy on me & i maybe should have gone with the medium. i'm 5'11" and about 165 so usually wear a large. my problem is with the length. i knew it was a gamble, but the other color images on the 5'10" model gave me the hope that the dress would come close to being near my knees ... nope. it's a good 6" above them, and i couldn't wear this to work. so being the crafty sort, i'm pondering adding a few more lace layers to the hem.
4 I love the fabric of this shirt -- it's super soft. however the fit is off -- i'm normally a medium and the buttons across the chest were gaping open when buttoned (never a problem for me, i'm a 34b and not very busty). it is also a bit on the short side, especially when the general trend is toward longer shirts/tunics. i would recommend sizing up (in fact i'm going to try this in a large, fingers crossed...)
4 This is a good basic casual skirt, and the grayish color is a great neutral. i saw it in store just kind of hanging by itself and decided to try it on. i usually wear a 6 in skirts, but always have to size up in hd so i grabbed an 8, which fit well. i will say it's definitely a little snug though, even sizing up. the fabric is soft and flowy, and will work well for both late summer and early fall. i'd recommend it.
4 Love love this dress! i got the regular size, but the length is more on the petite side. it's shorter than what i'm comfortable with, so will probably return it.
4 A fun top!i tried on both the medium and large (i'm between sizes, 5'4", 34g) and preferred the large. the medium waist rode up a bit on my torso, so the large stayed down a bit. also, the medium pleats did not fall as nicely on my chest.
4 Cute and comfy! i usually wear a small but bought a medium because it appeared to run a little small.
4 This jumpsuit is fabulous in person! it is elegant and easy and very figure flattering. i have a very curvy shape but a 34 ddd bust so i would say i am a top heavy hourglass. this jumpsuit does me right. the only thing i would say is i don't think it would be very comfortable on a person with a long torso. i am 5'3" and bought this in 6 regular and the length is perfect with heels. but the whole top half fits me perfectly but shows alot of boob if i'm not careful. but i don't think it would be s
4 I purchased this blouse over the summer and it's very pretty. i love the cap sleeves with the lace and the detail in the front. it can be dressed up or dressed down, my only complaint is that it wrinkles very easily.
4 This dress is adorable, but it unfortunately didn't work for me. i agree with the reviews that stated the fabric is very heavy
4 This is a lovely blouse. i think is a bit roomy, but even so, i like the look. i have to dress business casual for work and this blouse fits the bill as it's not too casual.
4 I love the pattern, but the color was not great on my skin tone. i tried on the regular size and it wasn't great. teh cut could work, but overall, i didn't feel like it was enough for me to order the petite to see, and i sometimes do. in a tall darker toned person, this would be gorgeous. what i like the most is the color pattern in the print, and shimmer.
4 I think i will really love this skirt. it is comfortable and has a lovely sheerness to it. it does have a bit of a weird, long drop waist, but it is very comfortable and still manages to be flattering. i think this will be a great piece for transitioning to the fall and winter seasons. i can wear it with short sleeves now and sweaters soon. i am happy with my purchase.
4 I love the length of this top and i love tops that don't cling in the tummy area. it fits well and the crochet detailing is nice. for reference, i'm 5'.4.5", 150 lbs, 34dd and the m fit me well. since i'll be wearing this with leggings mostly during colder months, this top is a little bright and the material is not meant for cold days. since i live in texas, i can get away wearing it even in colder months.
4 I just got a pair of these in petite 28. and really like them. i am short though so even the petite length is too long for me- i wish it was the height of the cuff shorter than it is so i end up folding the cuff up. it still looks cute though. the stitching details are nice and quality seems good. hoping they hold up. the fabric seems durable if not a little too thick for hot summer weather but great for indoor a/c office temperatures. i am not going to buy another pair at full price but would c
1 I love the teal color of this t-shirt and the macrame design at the top is beautiful, however, the top is way too large.  i usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops, so i ordered the size s, there is so much fabric below the chest it fits like a maternity top.  i know if i order an xs, i will have the same problem.  below the bust, the top is not flattering and it&amp;#39;s a shame.
1 I really liked this shirt the one time i got to wear it...but when i washed it, according to the directions on the tag, it shrunk! a lot! the sleeves are now too tight, and it is much shorter. thinking about returning it to the store, but in any case, i cannot wear it again.
4 The perfect cardigan for transitional seasons! i live in southern vermont and i can already tell this cardigan will be in heavy rotation during the summer to fall and spring to winter transition times. has such a cute back detailing that gives you a break from your common cardigans. great quality. i'm 126 lbs 5'4 and i got the small petite and is perfect if you want it to be slightly loose but not swimming in it!
4 I really liked this jumpsuit but it just wasn't perfect. the design at the top is a bit stiff compared to the rest of the jumpsuit. i felt the whole thing ran just slightly too large. it was nice - but not amazing.
4 I have the purple and the white. i purchased the purple first in m. it wasn't too big to return, but it was a little roomier than necessary but when i saw the white on sale, i purchased it in s which fit just fine--still plenty roomy as the style allows. both these are cute alone and also with a little sweater or denim jacket. i haven't washed them yet but i imagine washing on delicate with a good gentle detergent will keep them looking nice for a long time.
4 I really love the look and style of these. i am not a fan of thong underwear; definitely prefer these bikini or "hipster" styles, but sometimes it's hard to find them in attractive design. this pair is definitely attractive and i like how they fit and look a lot. i've only worn them once and they held up well for the day -- i often find lace can rip on the first wear, so i was wary. they did okay, but i do worry that they seem delicate enough i could accidentally stuck a thumb through it and rip
4 The "peachy" color read as pretty gold on me, which i think was good for my pale skin and sandy hair. the lavender accent color is also very nice. forgiving fit, elegant fabric, pretty print, respectable hemline, super flattering neckline, love the pockets... all in all, i think this dress is a nice choice for day events.
1 I was so excited to try these, it's hard to find cute bermuda shorts. the legs were so wide. my husband asked if i was wearing his shorts. they don't look that wide in the picture. i am 5'4" and 130 lbs i bought my regular size 28 but the waist was huge i could have sized down one or two sizes. unrolled they came to my knee.
4 This top is comfortable and pretty plus, i like the extra length in the sleeves. it is very lightweight and i'm cold natured so, i wear a bra top tankini underneath for warmth.
1 On a hot summer 90 degree day the blue ink on the dress stained the dress and my new tory burch bag. i would never have expected that the blue print would bleed all over me and my new dress. great dress and such a wonderful fit...too bad its unwearable now.
4 I tried on the xs in store i typically need petite) and it was a great length for me, i think petite would be too short for me to wear to work. the xs was a little snug on the waist, but the rest of the skirt fit perfectly, so though it was snug, i think i would still buy the xs. (stretchy band). the cream color/ivory is a nice summery color, not see-through unless you have dark unders. flirty and overall nice and airy for warm summer days. 115 lbs, 26-27 inches waist)
4 This is definitely again, a bit big. i'm usually a med, that is what i got, i could have gotten a small, but the arm holes might have been a tad tight then. i'm keeping the med, in case it shrinks, as it is part rayon, and rayon always shrinks if put in the washer. it is a great casual piece that will go with most anything. i love the tie, as you can then tighten the waist up a bit, or leave looser. the material is soft and not clingy. this is why i love a rayon blend. it hits me below my waist
4 This dress has a beautiful pattern, and is perfect for work. i wore it with tights recently, but could see wearing it in the summer too- the print is versatile enough that it translates. the top layer is sort of a crepe like fabric and there were a lot of strings that needed to be cut that were hanging off. i got many compliments the first time i wore this! i'm very curvy and i got the medium and it fits great and is very flattering.
4 I think this shawl is much more stunning on than on the hanger. i think it will be a great piece to transition into fall, wearing it over a black or white tee. it can be dressed up or down. especially for the sale price, a great piece!
4 This dress is absolutely perfectly delightful! fits like a glove and is stunning on. i couldn't be happier with this purchase! i wore it to a wedding in october and felt beautiful and sexy all at the same time. i usually struggle with dresses because i am under 5 feet, i purchased a 0p and it fits very well. no tailoring needed. only problem was that once i was on the dance floor the hooks in the front of the dress began to come undone, yikes! i had to leave the dance floor a couple of times and
4 I really like this sweater a lot. it runs huge though. i have a m/l and i'm swimming in it (5'9" sz 12-14). i like the length and the swingy-ness. there's enough coverage for me to feel comfortable layering it over a bra cami and leggings. the shoulder detail is what makes it. the only downside is that the threads on the reverse side of the embroidery are a little rough, but not enough to bother me. the knitted fabric is soft and cool feeling. i plan on wearing it into fall with "real pants" and
4 I was very excited to receive this dress (online only so had to have shipped.) the colors are classic primary as shown. the outer fabric is heavy and canvas-like, but the lining is white nylon-ish. the length was good. the dress is nicely lined but sadly runs very small in the bust. i am a size 8 and a 34b and this dress was too small for me. i rarely have this issue. sadly, it's going back. i should have waited to read reviews and sized up. fyi the belt has a look that appears worn similar to p
4 I love this tshirt, but the speckled grey looks more like roof shingles in person. i'm going to try to exchange it for a different color.
4 I tried the b&w one in the store. liked the look and feel of it. fabric is soft and comfortable. for reference, i'm 5'4" and 115 lbs. this dress runs large. size 0 was too big on me - armhole, waist, length, etc. i'm ordering 0p online, hoping it will fit better. not a huge fan of the black belt, otherwise very happy with the dress.
4 Loved these beach pants! i purchased the size medium in the coral. i loved the accents on the ties and the little pom pom details. i did get many compliments on them. the only thing i don't love about them is the material is very thin. i know they are beach pants but i personally would have liked slightly more weight to them. i wore them once with a pair of cropped leggings underneath and i thought it was a very cute way to wear them with some additional substance underneath.
4 Great sweater - very pretty and warm. i would say it fits true to size, but the fit itself/style is just a little roomier - just like on the model. i usually take an xs and the xs fit great.the tag says to dry clean or hand wash in cold. i always wash my wool sweaters in cold water, in a garment bag, on delicate wash and have never had a problem.but, when i did that for this sweater, it shrunk to a size that would fit a 4 year old. the fabric in the arms stuck together, like velcro. very inter
4 Tried these on several times in store and never bought them, but was able to get them with a 20% email- seemed like a better price for the product. the color is rust and a little odd for my wardrobe - wish they also came in black. love the style and they are very comfortable, perfect for late summer- can wear on errands or dress them up a little with shoes/accessories for casual dinner out. happy i finally purchased them!
4 This dress makes me this of jackie kennedy on the beach in the summertime. i love the pattern and the pockets, oh my goodness the pockets! i saw this in the store and ordered one while i was there online because the ribbon on the zipper was frayed. well guess what we i got it in the mail at home the ribbon was also frayed. ugh. i kept it because it wasn't a huge deal breaker. the color is a little strange, not a true red more of a orangish red. i think it's super versatile and hopefully i will w
1 I wish i had read all the reviews before purchasing. the sweater looked liked everything i would be interested in online. once i pulled it out of the bag, my first thought was how could retailer send me a used, washed and shrunken sweater. it is nothing like the picture. it fits like a midriff top, not exaggerating. i'm 5.6, ordered the m, don't waste your shipping money on this.
4 This top is very pretty. it's a bit more voluminous than the picture would let on, but otherwise as expected. you can adjust the ties at the shoulder.
4 I ordered the green top in store after trying on a medium that was huge. the small fits me well and i love the flowy style and softness of the fabric. i like it with skinny capri jeans and the color will transition well into fall. i'm in florida where it is still very hot in october. if you typically wear either a small or medium, order the small in this top.
4 I purchased this sweater in the grey color and loved it so much i decided to buy it in purple as well. however, when i received it, the color was much much darker than pictured and even looked black sometimes. decided to return :/
4 I saw this jacket on the sale rack at my local store but the size was extra small, and needed a medium. the store was able to order since it showed back order . i do miss the charge send option, but still love retailer! normally i wear a medium in this brand. i received my order today and it's a beautiful jacket however there's a few things that could have been done in the manufacture that would've improved it. one, the jacket is not lined and it would be beneficial if the jacket was lined or even
4 I purchased this top in the taupe color, and it is much prettier in person than it photographs online. it runs about a half size too large, and sits slightly off the shoulders. fun casual top for the fall.
4 I'm so in love with this skirt. i sized up to a 4 (i'm typically a 2 in maeve) and it's pure perfection. i had to steam it after getting home from the store because it wrinkled up pretty quickly. wore it with my copper birks and a chambray top but i can see this being dressed up for work as well. took off a star due to his easily it wrinkled.
4 Just note the pink is different than in the photos. much hotter/more saturated. apart from that surprise, overall i'd recommend. nice design.
4 Purchased this dress at the sale price, with an additional 20% off sale, not exactly sure what to expect-- the print is so different than my usual style preference. so glad i did! while the dress is way oversized (for reference, i'm 5'4, 132 lbs) ordered size sm but prob should have gone with xs) it's stylish, yet effortless. today is the first day of wear (at my office) and already received many complements.
4 I love these pants - the color is great, the style is comfortable and easy but can be dressed up. like other reviewers, i washed these according to the care instructions and they shrunk horribly. however - after some googling, i was able to find a fix. soak the pants for 5-10 minutes in warm water mixed with 3-4 tsp hair conditioner. gently wring them out and start to (gently) stretch the fabric as much as possible. hang on a drying rack and continue to gently stretch the fabric as the pants dry
4 This dress is gorgeous. the quality is high, runs true to size, and is very flattering! my only issue is the tule. i already have hips, so the tule makes the dress over-flare. i am going to have the tailor remove the tule and it will be perfect. for those who are not an hourglass shape naturally, this will help provide the extra shaping.overall, i love this dress and will be keeping it.
4 It's a great addition for summer. defiantly need a tank on under it but very pretty.
4 This romper is really cute. it's flowy and wide at the middle, which i like. it's comfortable. i ordered my usual size small and it was too big. i'm hoping an exchange will do the trick .
4 I like the color of this dress, but its a little thin for fall. on me, the neckline is more round and the sleeves a little cappier. i have dresses in this brand in both a size small and medium. i went with a small in this dress. returning it for a medium.
4 I ordered the 00 p after trying on the regular 0, and that was better. it runs wide, the lining is true to size, but the overlay is loose. the colors are pretty, the design is nice, but i didn't love it as much as other ones.likes: the studs add an edgier look to a almost dainty look (flow y sheer fabric). the cut is flattering if you get the right size (recommend one size down).no big dislikes...why i would still recommend.115 lbs, 30dd chest, 26.5 in waist... 00p
4 This dress was absolutely beautiful in person, but it didn't end up working out for me. i wear a 10, the 10 fit, but i have a 34g chest and because of that the waistline didn't sit low enough - it was just below my bust instead of at my natural waist. i really wanted this to work and think it would be great for the right person. seemed tts. love the detailing!
4 I wanted to love this dress.....the reviews were great, the price was right and i needed a simple black dress. the fabric (jersey) is lovely and drapes nicely and the print was pretty. unfortunately, the armholes were way too long and low for me and even with a black bra, i was sharing more of my lingerie than i wanted. perhaps someone with a slightly smaller chest could size down and avoid oversharing!for reference, i am 5'5", 145 and wear a 30gg bra. i ordered the m.
4 I was looking for a flannel-y buttondown that i could wear with leggings or skinny jeans, and this definitely fits the bill. i like the cute details like the contrast collar and cuffs, and also the slight back pleat and the curved hemline. i'm not crazy about the colorways that are offered, but the pink is cute enough, and as other reviewers mentioned, i find the quality a little lacking. i'd be very happy with this shirt on sale, but not sure about it at full price. i got a size s (5'4", 120 lb
4 These are darling. love flannel and pattern which is very upbeat. wish they were a little more pegged/slim/tapered at the bottoms.
4 Cute tee shirt but it runs very large.i ordered a small and probably an xxs would have fit.unfortunately i have to return it.for reference i am 5'3" and 110 lbs.
4 I really like this shirt. the material was a little heavier cotton than i expected in looking at the picture which is good otherwise it could look like you slept in the shirt. it is something that is going to wrinkle when you wear it so if that is bothersome then pass on this shirt. it's a bit longer which i also like because it will work by itself or under a jacket or sweater.
4 These pants overall are very comfortable, but have an unusual fit. they tend to run a bit short, and i always have to get pants hemmed shorter, so if you have long legs or like more draping, you probably won't like these. they also ran a bit large in the waist and thigh, a bit puffy, i had to size down in order to get a good fit. very good quality, and cute design.
1 This dress is not flattering. the slip is very small and short and the dress is big and billowy. like the other reviewer said, its more like a tablecloth that you stick your head through. it was really hard to figure out how to cinch in the waist but it didn't help regardless. the length is not accurate either. i would say it's a pretty short dress (mid thigh) but that probably depends on the person. it also makes you look very horizontal. i was really excited about this dress but it's getting r
4 This is like wearing an afghan, but i get cold really easy so for me that's a good thing. and it's super soft and not itchy. i could easily never take this off. runs a little large, but that should be fine when it gets layered. ...only thing i didn't like was the one long stitch that holds the wrap in place. i worry it will snap and the whole thing will unravel.
4 This 'poor boy' mock t-neck/high crew neck top looks a tiny bit more olive to me than the online photos. the fit runs on the smaller size, and the sleeves will be bracelet length or 3/4 length for taller women..i tried a size xs that was in the store and it fit with the sleeves just above my wrists, but a size s would have been fine too (i'm 5'2", currently 33-25-37, narrow shoulders and torso).for reference, even the size m of the short sleeve version fit fine, so there is a lot of give..no
1 The fit was not flattering at all, but the worst part was the colors were really dull and not bright as shown in the online photos.
4 I'm 5'5" 127lbs. ordered size small. not sheer. bodysuit snaps. great to wear with skirts and wide leg pants!!
4 This shirt is much more flattering in person. if i hadn't seen it in store, i don't think it would have caught my eye. i like the mix of casual and dressy this top has (i got it specifically for teaching). the one thing i noticed, however, was that the first xs i tried on looked very big on me. i tried a second on and the fit was much more flattering! i highly recommend that you try on the specific blouse you plan to purchase before you actually buy it. i'm glad i tried a second on, because i th
4 These pants pair well with anything - dress up or down, boots or sandals....but beware, they run big and rear end stretches out when sitting at work all day. if you have a booty these pants will be perfect buy one size down tho. if you have a flat rear like me, then buy two sizes down. length is good to leave uncured, just above ankle or roll up to perfect height. great color - fabric is amazing.
4 This sweater was cute and comfy and was true to size.
4 Really liked the styling on this jumpsuit. it looks great on, the lattice back is unusual. i had been looking for a little black jumpsuit for the longest time and this fits the bill. just wish the fabric wasn't polyester. on the down side the top buttons are really hard to put on and take off. if you take care of your nails, it could do a number on them. the bottom buttons are easier. can only imagine a struggle when trying to take this off in an emergency bathroom break!
4 I was unsure about the color when i got it in the mail but it is very flattering. it is roomy for sure. with a pair of slim shorts or pants it looks great though. creasing may be an issue. 5ft 6, 135 lbs 36 d...the xs looks good with room to spare.nice weight fabric for fall.
4 I love the colors, and saw the xxs p in a store, so tried it on, but sadly, that was still a lot of fabric on me. i think if you have very small thin arms, that may work, but with muscles, it just made me look bigger than i am... the design (pattern) is really nice though. 115 lbs, 30 dd flat
4 I got these pretty boy shorts because i was looking for a panty that was comfy for bedtime--pretty but with a fair amount of coverage. i am really happy with them. wonderful with a tank top or chemise. i think the ruffles are a bit bulky for skinny jeans, but i love them for sleeping. they feel special.
4 These pants are so soft and so comfortable! i was absolutely in love at first sight. however, i got the petite, because i am 5'3, and they were still a little longer than i like my pants to be. i wanted them to hit right above the ankle, just like the photo, however, they are a tad longer. i still love them and they are still as comfy as ever, so i am gonna deal with the length!!
4 I am so happy with this jumpsuit! it is the perfect comfortable and casual summer outfit. the fabric is super soft. i was unsure about the length at first because it's shorter than my other jumpsuits, but if you scrunch up the bottom of the legs and add some sandals, it's a great look. highly recommend!
4 Hahaha! as gorgeous as this piece is, i look absolutely ridiculous in it. i am 5'7'' 115 lbs but have a long torso and so the crotch area is, well, a little unflattering to say the least:) i am really sad because i shy away from shorts due to my year round pale skin, but this fabric and color worked really well for me. the length of the shorts is also nice and the back is beautiful! i've never had a romper and i was truly hoping this one would be the one for me. it is all round perfect...if you
4 I tried these on in the store and was unsure about sizing. once they went on sale i bought the xs and have already worn them twice.good transitional grey colored short into fall. need to be ironed or steamed after wearing for a while but comfy and smooth out easily.
4 For a brand called "tiny"--this dress was really big. i ordered my usual m and it was like a sack--virtually no shape to it at all. i haven't been a small in many decades, so i'm really hesitant to order it again. i'm afraid i'll be like goldilocks--"too big!", "too small!"--but i'm probably going to give it a whirl because the green print is so pretty, and i l like that it has sleeves to protect from sun. and pockets! lots of good qualities, just putting them together in a wearable size seems t
4 Very well made dress but runs extremely small! definitely size up!
4 This dress is so comfortable, and i love the unique faux leather skirt and lace design. it really adds a special touch to the dress. i only gave it four stars because the top half is pretty boring...i wish the neckline wasn't so matronly. i'll definitely need a bib necklace or scarf to dress it up. i'm 5'5" and 115 and ordered the xs. i wish the dress cut in a little more at the sides to accentuate an hourglass figure, also. my husband loved it.
4 If you love the print then this is the dress for you. it is so incredibly flattering for hour-glass shapes. and it has pockets! i wanted to keep it but i just did not like the pattern and every guy i showed it to hated the pattern. if they had it in a different color, i would buy it in every color. :)
4 I really wanted to love this top but the other reviewers are spot on when they say it is too short and boxy. so, fresh out of the package, the ruffle hit me right at the widest part of my hips and when i raised my arms the shirt exposed my midriff. not cute. i really liked the quality though so i washed it on delicate and then tugged gently to stretch the length out and hung to dry. now, it's still a wee boxy, of course, but significantly longer and much cuter on me. so, i'm keeping. even thinki
1 When i tried these on in the store i was thrilled - they were comfy as yoga pants and  the fit was divine. i thought i had found the perfect jeans and i splurged on them for my birthday. after wearing just two times they are baggy and the knees are totally bagged out, saggy and faded.so disappointing - i want my $180 back!
4 I really love this top. it looks great under a black tahari suit that i wear to work. the neckline looks really nice. the only negatives are that it's a bit sheer, so i have to wear a tank under it and it's a little wide. it looks fine tucked in or hanging out with jeans for a more casual look. i'd recommend this top, especially if you can get it on sale. pretty true to size. i'm 5'4'', 120 pounds, and a 32 c and the size 4 top fit me nicely.
4 This is interesting material- very heavy and smooth. it is fits great, i was able to size down. the color is a brown/copper and should match most things. overall, it is a great skirt for colder weather since it is thick material.
4 I got this top in white and it is cute. the fabric is a weird kind of polyester, and kind of shiny. i got the medium and it pulls a little around the chest. overall i like it.
4 So i now own three sparrow wool sweater dresses (shyle, bressay, this one). they all have the same problem...hips cut large/wide past the waist! everything from the waist up fits great. i'm not sure who they are using as a fit model, but she must be curvy in that j.lo way (which is nice but not my shape). i love the green color, the warmth, the neckline, and the easy fit. i will wear a coat to hide the body of the skirt. and do more squats
4 I ordered this in my usual retailer size, xspetite and it was too baggy in the bust. granted, i'm only a 34aa, but i would still expect it to be a little smaller in the bust at that size. the elastic waist was a little loose too (i have a 26" waist, 34" hips) and the inner slip showed a tiny bit like another reviewer said but it's the same fabric as the dress. the slip is adjustable but it's attached to the dress at the waist. it wasn't flattering on me in the hips either. this was a miss for me b
4 Well, i totally disagree with the previous reviewer on this one! i think this top is very pretty. yes, it does hide any flaws in the tummy, but it is not wide nor does it make you look pregnant (side or front view). i am 5 ft, 2 inches, broad shouldered, 36c and the small fit nicely (i usually wear a small to medium in retailer tops). i am thinking of purchasing the xs as there is still plenty of room around the chest/arm area. the lace is pretty, looks good worn with a dark colored pant. the only
4 I love this skirt! it is a lovely and soft gauze layer with lining underneath. i live where the summer"s are hot and humid and this skirt keeps me cool when everything else just sticks to me. it is, for sure, very limited because it does not have a zipper.... if you cannot get this over your hips or over your shoulders and bust, this is not the skirt for you. the elastic waistband is really strong and really highlights your waist, but yes, i am petite and i struggle to get it on. once it is on,
4 I was drawn to this top due to its unique detailing and soft, casual cotton feel. i wear a nude bra underneath with no problem. i'm 5'5" 120 (34c) and the small hits right at my hips, so it's not to short or too long. i often wear an xs in tops and i didn't even try on the xs in this one because i felt the small fit just right. with the cutout detailing, i'll hand wash this. i hope it holds up.
4 Since these are high waist pants, i think the size given is more for a lower waist measurement where most pants these days typically sit. i'm 5'10", 150 lbs and ordered a size 31 but it was much too large. i love the style of these pants a lot. they look great if you have long legs, the size 31 ran about 5" above my ankle, higher than is shown in the photos but it looks great.
4 Like the other reviewers, i opted for the grey version. almost every tunic dress i've tried winds up looking like a sack when it's on my body, so i was very pleased when this dress looked pretty great. the neckline is perfect - nice depth and addition of on-trend lacing - and the length (love the shirttail hemline) is also perfect. the drape of the material keeps it from looking like a shapeless bag. my only comment #and it's quite minor - i'd give this 4.5 stars if i could) is that the pockets
4 I love most pure and good clothing pieces, mostly because the fit and fabric are comfy and made of good quality materials. this tunic does deliver on both counts, but i is very, very long and straight up and down.fyi: i have a boyish figure, having no waist/hips. i have a broad shoulder/back, so the cowl neckline coupled with the very long and straight tunic doesn't really flatter my body. it would be okay for just haging around the house, but i wouldn't feel comfortable wearing this tunic out
4 This wash is so beautiful but i found the rise too long for me. so happy i found them in 24p here on the site. they are wonderful but i'd like to caution with respect to proportions:i have long legs (for a petite, ha!) and a petite upper body. these jeans almost entirely differ with respect to length. so id say if the your torso is fairly true to a regular fit, and your legs are shorter, you totally save on hemming the regular fit jeans. like another reviewe noted, hemming will reduce the fl
4 All the reviews have said the truth. this shirt is absolutely adorable in terms of the top. but you will definitely need this tailored at the waist. give it a little more taper at the seams to suit a woman's curves. it seems almost funny they didn't do it to start with given the really feminine details on this shirt with the lace and the sleeves...
4 Agree with other contributer - this is a great piece to snag on sale. i bought this 2 months post partum with the intention of hiding the post baby belly - which is does well! i think it fits true to size (i'm typically l and this l fit well). i can see how certain body types it would look maternity, but i'm short and curvy and the blouse is flattering. it's lightweight, so i plan to add a cardigan in the fall/winter.
4 Wasn't too sure about this jacket when i got it in the mail - seemed a little boxy on - maybe a smaller size would've worked better but i want to be able to layer. however, i'm keeping it because it's versatile, i love the contrast of the front/back and the buttons on the sleeve (which actually button and un-button, meaning they aren't just for show and the sleeves can be easily rolled up). a great basic jacket with some neat details.
4 Love the dress! feel it fits true to size or slightly larger...knocked off a star as my dress arrived without the slip liner. i luckily have a slip that works from another dress...the beading is a lovely surprise! subtle and just enough sparkle in the sun, but not too much.
1 It's sheer, the design /print is casual, but on silk like material. had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it! who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer???
4 I love this duster. it's really different and interesting. i wear it with the dress in the picture but i have the green dress.
4 Love love love the cut of this tank top. it's is super thin and see thru however. wish it was made a bit thicker. i got it in white and you can see right thru it. however the cut is so fabulous i can over look that.
4 Well-made and well-designed tunic top. looks great over pants. not recommended for tucking in, as the pin tucks hit right at the waistline. the ivory is a bit see-through so i wear it with a cami underneath. be aware that your bra will likely be visible through the cut-outs in front. i didn't realize that the first time i wore it and was amazed to discover, at the end of the evening, how tacky it looked. to avoid that you need a low-cut bra. with the proper undergarments, this is a great top tha
1 I can always count on retailer to sell unique pieces, so when i saw this sweatshirt online, i ordered it right away.  it&#39;s adorable and quirky, however, when i received it in the mail, it reminded me of something my grandma would wear.  the sleeves are puff sleeves and are really long, while the bottom of the sweatshirt hit pretty high on my waist that when i raised my arms my stomach was showing.  if this was a more tailored sweatshirt, i would be keeping it, but sadly it&#39;s going back.
4 I really wanted to love this top, but the fit was just off on me. the design and material is so pretty. however, i expected the fit to be more "peplum", but there was not any structure. i think this would be better on more slender women.
4 Gorgeous colors and great shape for a mini dress. stunning on. the only con is how low the back goes. a bra alone underneath is not possible. will need to wear with a finer shirt underneath.
1 Very cute top. i went down a size because for me it was a little large in the back, but that was just my taste. i purchased the denim print.
4 A good sweater but something about it was just not right for me. just didn't feel like i would wear it.
1 I had to return this blouse because it ended up been too small and super itchy. im kind of busty but medium usually works and this one was super tight across my chest. not comfortable at all and the fabric is kind of a sheer with the sparkly lines in silver.wouldn't recommend it.
4 I really likes these jeans. they are comfortable with stretch and look cute. the price is high but an investment for sure !
4 I am 5'5", 145 lbs, a cup. depending on the style of the shirt i am between a medium and a small at retailer, in this case i purchased a small. even in the small the body has ample space which adds to the relax look without appearing sloppy. and because the shirt is wider i would say you can easily size down. the shirt is definitely flirty and fun with a great print, and easy to wear off of the shoulders. i invested in another retailer top that is also an "off of the shoulder" design but it does not
4 I got the tan one. my friend got the same skirt. she's tiny, i'm not (i have hips). we both got a size 6, and it fit us both. it just sits higher on my waist than it does on hers (above my navel - not above hers). i do have a small waist. the skirt has a lot of movement, but isn't poofy. it is not see-through. it has that retailer charm, where it looks pretty basic but is really flattering and charming. a new wardrobe staple. can dress it up or down. only problem is the zipper in the back -
4 This top had so much potential! i bought the striped colorway in an xs, which is my normal size. i am a 32d with an athletic build so the sleeves are tighter on my arms than pictured, although they are adjustable. the top of the shirt fits perfectly, but the bottom is very wide and short. i'm only 5'2" but it's still just a tad shorter than i'd like. i wish it was slightly more fitted and then it would be perfect. unfortunately, this one is going back.
4 I am very petite (size 00, xxs) and i got the smallest size this top came in and it fit great in the bust and arms but the bottom billowed out a little too much for my body frame type. it is so beautiful i had considered getting it altered, but the material was simply too see through so it had to go back. beautiful gauze material and detailing though!
4 Too bad the blue one is sold out in my size (petite), i ordered the 00p, based on feedback at m store that it runs big, that was a good choice (i am 5'1.5", 115 lbs#. the material teds to wrinkle though, so will have to think about keeping it.cut is flattering, i like it with the belt like the picture on the model, but was nice too with the drawstring and a nice chunky necklace #bought black dress, so gold necklace is nice).length was mid calf, but because it has a rounded hem, it wa
4 I did like this coat, however the material was just not what i expected. i was hoping for more of a traditional wool material, but this had a fuzziness to it. not fitted in the waist either, which might just be the style but not what i was hoping for.
4 Love the style of this shirt. its flattering and light material, good for all weather and layering.
4 Really nice quality warm, sleek sweater. runs small-ish. i'm 5'8", 140 lbs, 34c. i got the small and could have gotten x-small.
4 The picture is not a good representation of the cut and the fabric. the cut is a-line, trapezoid-shaped. the shirt is smallest in the shoulders and chest and then it flairs out to the sides. the cut works with pants mostly, you have to tuck the shirt in if wearing with skirts. the lace back drapes beautifully and is a little longer than the front, which again lend to wearing with skinny pants and such.the fabric has a quality of freshly starched. pleasant surprise. it lacks softness of leisure
4 Bought peach online, but exchanged for other color. there is a metallic gold stripe that i didn't expect in peach option. i thought i would mention as it wasn't so apparent in photo. interestingly there is no metallic thread in the other color option.
4 I ordered xs/petite but i think i better ordered xxs which was already sold out at the time i purchased. i recommend one size smaller for this sweater. this sweater is designed very wide for your shoulder which could be fallen down for people who usually prefer petite size but it's really adorable!!
1 Although beautiful colors this eyelet dress is quite heavy and the buttons have no give- one of them literally cracked when i tried to unbutton it. unbuttoning it was difficult due to the tight weave. it just misses the mark and will be going back.
4 This is a great lounging dress or a great beach cover up. i ordered up a size after reading other reviews. although, i feel like my normal size would have been fine probably. i ordered the black and it is not see through. it's very light weight and comfortable. i may even order in another color just because it's so great to wear around the house.
4 The sweater is beautiful and lightweight. it is very short. i am short-waisted but felt that it was too cropped for me. the deign is lovely and the fabric is soft.
4 This pajama-like dress is not worth $150 (full price plus tax in texas), so i can't really justify keeping it. i kept having to pull it over on one side so it would align correctly. it also runs big. i bought the m (which i am returning) and it bunches at the waist but the length was perfect. the s is too short on the bottom. i love the color, but it's going back. i'd buy it if it were on sale.
4 Alright, so i really love this shirt. but i am having it taken in to fit me. i weigh 110 and am 5 foot 3 and pretty petite, and this shirt is too big on me and i got an xs. i didn't wanna get xxs and am glad i didn't because i think it would be too short. i'm going to keep the shirt, but it is too big on me, it puffs out in the front and some in the back when you stand certain ways and i need to have it taken in, or else it isn't as flattering as it should be. the material is awesome and i love
4 I was surprised when my friend tried this on (they dind't have my size in store so she did), how ,uch materil there is on this top. it is very beautiful, but might be too much on a petite frame. the back is almost like a mini train, which is pretty ocol in my opinion. great colros in person too, yes, a tiny bit of shimmer :-)
4 This dress is really simple and elegant and i want to love it but i'm having a hard time getting it to fit right. i'm normally a size 4/6 and i bought this in an 8 and couldn't zip it up. i'm a 36d which is part of the problem so i exchanged it for a 10 and i can now zip it but the bar in the back i thought would cover my bra strap but like other reviewers mentioned its a bit high. most of my bras fall right into the hole beneath the bar. its unfortunate because i wanted to love this dress. i mi
1 I wanted this so badly, to wear as a dress over a slip. but it is not cute or flattering when you put it on. it made me look 20 pounds heavier than i am, and the fit was awful. i usually wear an xs in dresses at retailer and this swallowed me. i am petite but this is just waaaaaay too big. so disappointed because it's so pretty.
4 I bought this top for work but i can also wear it out with friends. it is made well and has a lining that is comfortable and makes it flow nicely. it will be nice for summer. you can tie the neck or just leave the ties down so it has options.
4 I usually wear a small or a medium in tee shirts, and i had to get a medium so that it fit comfortable throughout the shoulder area.
4 It is a really cute sweater. i thought it would be a little longer based on the picture. on me it hits at my waist but i am still okay with it. the design is unique and i am happy with the purchase.
4 If you are afraid of the jumpsuit trend but like dresses, this will be for you.  the cut is flattering, and may not need a bra (i am droppy, but it was fine). the legs are wide enough that one time, i had both legs in one hole, so-to-speak, and it is very flowy. the patterns are both nice, i like the geometric one, but the polka dot is always a classic. the petite size fit me just right (xsp) at 115 lbs, 30dd. i like the tie it goes from around the cups to tie on the back, so you can almost ti
4 Soft, cozy, and the heathered off-white/palest gray is a great cool-toned neutral. the only surprise was that it is lightweight; not nearly as warm as it looks. the hood has a fuzzy sherpa lining, the unlined jacket has a soft fleece or flannel finish on the inside with zigzag seams, the ouside looks like a sweatshirt. it does work great as a top layer though. 50% polyester, 38% cotton, 12% rayon..got this in a size 's' to fit my hips and it works out great. i'm 5'2", currently 33-25-37ish, wi
4 I love hand knit sweaters. they look expensive. this sweater is pricey and i shied away from the original price. at the reduced price, it is worth it. my sweater is bright blue and pure white so not sure what other reviewer got. however, it is itchy. i admit that i have somewhat sensitive skin so if i cannot wear a silk layer under it, or find a way to make it less itchy on me, i will have to reluctantly return it. i normally wear large but the medium fit fine.
1 As the other reviewer stated the dress is not lined and the fabric feels very cheap. i tried the sp as well and felt i could have gone down to the xsp. i like the style and coloring but given the price and lack of quality this is going back.
4 Just received this and know i will get a lot of enjoyment from it. cute fit and since i have had something similar in the past, i know how versatile it is. nice soft material too!
4 This is a beautiful skirt. i wanted to make sure that i received a size that fit so i ordered two different sizes (pxs and ps). i typically wear a pxs but since the description mentions a side zip and it looked as if the skirt was to fit higher on the waist i thought i should also try a size up. as i mentioned it is lovely. light airy. i just wanted something easy to throw on and look put together with flat sandals and a tank for the hot weather that is coming and for an upcoming vacation to the
4 Seafolly is my favorite swim/beach brand. the quality is always great! this is a colorful sheer kaftan that will get much use this summer.
4 I'm 5'2 and bought the dress in a petite medium. i like to buy clothes that i can wear to work and this dress was almost too short. if it were any shorter, it wouldn't have worked. if i were to buy it again, i'd probably go with a non-petite size. also, i ordered the dress online and i found two snags in it as soon as i pulled it out of the box. i don't think they will be terribly noticeable, but just beware that this dress will apparently snag easily. i plan to wear it with a purse without meta
4 Free and easy but the fabric seems cheap.
4 The length hit at the wrong place for me. lovely knit though so i am very disappointed. it will be going back to the store. interesting muted color that strikes just the right balance. very warm - perfect for fall and winter.
4 Got this dress in the mail today, and will have to say that it is not the most figure flattering dress i own. my 5'5" athletic frame looks pretty boxy in this. that being said, the fabric is a soft, shiny blue/green. the garment swings nicely and has a slightly lower hem in the back (on me, anyway) and i think that's fun. who needs close fitting clothes during the holidays ? i'm keeping it. i plan to wear it with hot pink tights and boots.
4 I have the blue and holly joggers. i absolutely love the fit,  feel and color of the joggers. the oddity is that the elastic at the waist bunches in the blue pair but not the holly. it drives me crazy. i could only wear the blue for a couple of hours before i had to change into something else (unfortunately the holly joggers were in the wash).  i'm going to take the blue joggers to the seamstress. maybe she can fix them. 65", 135, small was perfect.
4 I really want to love this shirt, but the small is just way too big on me. for reference, i'm a 32d (which is why i didn't want to size down much more than a small), 5'6' and 125 and i'm drowning in this. i'm going to try it with different bottoms and ultimately will keep it because i do love the quality. just size down a couple of sizes!!
4 This jacket isn't as structures as i thought but it is very comfortable. runs true to size and feels nice. i am looking forward to wearing this in the fall
4 This dress is quite lovely, but there are a few things to know:the blue color is much more of a dark teal, with more of a dull green tinge than i expected. still pretty, but definitely not a pure blue. i loved the look of the blue online, but i think the pink might have worked a little better with my coloring.the dress is a bit low in front. not inappropriately low, but if you are hoping to be able to "adjust" by pulling the shoulders back a bit or something, be aware that the bodice drapi
4 This dress has potential, but it didn't work for me. it runs true to size to a little big, i ordered medium, my usual size for maeve). as for length it fit me as the model (5'9"). the reason i'm not keeping it is that i wish it had some darts in the back to help define the waist a bit,
4 These culottes are adorable on....if you order up two whole sizes! they run extremely small. fabric is thick, high quality and a beautiful color.
4 I sized down in this dress from a 6 to a 4 (32d-31-38). the 6 was too blousy in the bust and it did feel "sack-like". i sized down and suddenly it looked great--fitted enough through the bust and hips. be warned--this dress has to be pulled over your head. the fit in the bust will determine a lot. i am tall--almost 5' 9" and the length was great--similar to the model in the photo. the cream and black print is gorgeous.
4 I am 5' 4" and 120 lbs. i bought the xs as my frame is a bit on the smaller side, but the cut is huge. a pregnant woman could easily pull this off as a very cool maternity dress. i can see it being so cute with a pair of boots or sandals. i wanted to get the xxs, but it's sold out so sadly will have to send it back. but if it works for you, definitely buy it!
4 I love the weight and drape of this vest; it adds a finished touch to even the simplest t shirts. i plan on wearing it into the cooler months of fall. however, it runs a week bit small across the bust. i normally wear a medium at retailer but large would have been a better fit. sadly the large vest in the dark blue was sold out.
4 This is a great cover-up or tunic over leggings or capris. i am 5 foot two and it comes to my knee
4 I loved this top when i tried it on. i'm usually a small or medium and ordered the medium based on these reviews. the only problem with this for me was that you can see through it in the back. it showed every lump and bump around my bra. reluctantly, i am going to return it. if you don't have any lumps and bumps i think this is a great top. i wish it had worked for me. i debated about trying it on with a camisole to see if that would help, but don't really want to have to wear a camisole in the
4 This dress is so versatile. great summer wear!
4 This is a cute top but a little pricey for cotton t shirt material. the arms and shoulders/armpit feel a little tight but is loose and flowy below the bust. it is not as dressy in person as it appears in the photos. a cute top for jeans or leggings as the length falls below the hip.
1 The fit on this is so strange. the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift. the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price. the cups are padded, which is nice i suppose, but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i'm guessing. i'm a 32dd, size 8 in pants, and size 4/6 in dresses and i ordered a medium. i also have a long torso, which probably didn't help.
4 I was looking for a navy top to replace an overused navy silk cowlneck that i have been wearing for years. this is perfect. light, versatile and classic.
4 Nice piece. the fabric is very stretchy with that heavy luxe kind of feeling. the neck snap placket is genius because when it is snapped up the neck stays up without restricting the throat. nice long lenght too.
4 I ordered the copper in a medium which i felt was tts (5'4" 145). the color is beautiful and i love the buttons on the shoulders which i really didn't notice in the picture, the material is also very soft. but i have some complaints.. first i felt that the material, while soft, was not very substantial for the price. i purchased another vest from that store that has everything which was $100 less and seems to be the same quality. i also was expecting there to be some way to close the vest beside
4 An easy top that adds instant glamour. the burnout velvet is super fun for the holidays and yet the design is comfortable and easy. i have found this top can work day and night with the right accessories.
4 I did not try this on alone but rather with a long sleeve white tee and white button down shirt. i really liked both looks. if i find it to be itchy like the other review i will have to return. this is an effortless fashion statement yet it could easily be a weekender cozy staple. my only complaint is why two neutral colors? this would have been great if offered in a richer darker yarn. the two offered colors are so similar and both looked drab against my skin tone.
4 This top is very pretty and you can definitely wear it without a cami with a nude bra if you're an outgoing person, especially for a summer evening. my only confusion is the too high neckline. if it was just a little lower, it would look and feel less "chokey." i keep wanting to pull it down. i'm a size 0 and needed the xxs which fits like most people's xs's as sizing continues to get bigger. really lovely except for the neckline. looks great over white or colored shorts and is a nice mix of cas
4 A cute dress, though waist a little too high (more of an empire waist... hitting at widest part of rib cage). this looks like it should be a stretchy knit dress, but the detailing has no give whatsoever and the dress runs quite small. i usually wear a 00, but though i could get it zipped, it wasn't comfortable, and if i want to keep it, i'll need to size up to a 0. i'm 5'6", 32b-24-35.
4 This pair of flare is just what i have been searching for. the color is a nice vintage blue. i love the fit of the flare however please keep in mind these do run long and larger that size.
4 I saw this on a mannequin at the store and was instantly drawn in by all the beautiful blue lace and the overall design. however, when i tried it on, i personally found a few things that just didn't work for me:____________pros:- blue lace is lovely throughout, nicely done.- there's a little snap closure at the front of the dress where the fabric overlaps at the bra cups. i can only assume it's to make it easier to get the dress on. it's a nice little detail, although not sure if really
1 After reading the reviews i sized down to a 6. once i received it, i loved the fabric and color, however it was so ill-fitting. it's like the designer didn't even use female measurements and used a box to make this top--too wide. i liked it so much that i sized way down to a 0 and it still fit horribly. it is too wide and not long enough. both are going back!
4 This is beautiful on. it flatters the figure nicely. the material is a rougher cotton which seems oppressive for summer even though thin. it is very low cut but it looks wonderful.
4 Great top for in between seasons. comfy/soft/roomy. fyi - the pattern has tiny holes that will show through - i.e., bra, skin, etc.
4 For me this had too much material and was a little too tent like. a beautiful dress but not my style. i prefer more a line with not so much material.if you are looking for something roomy this is a good choice.
4 The pattern is cute and vibrant, and the shillouette is simple, but the courderoy felt too heavy and stiff and it was too small around the chest for me (36dd).
4 Really love it - soft and nice quality - only complaint is the straps are too long for a normal sized torso. the front drapes below my breasts at the tightest /smallest setting.
4 This dress is made well and fit nice. i am 64" and 135 lbs. i really wanted it keep it but it is going back. the colors in person are much more muted and with my pale blonde hair and fair skin the color was all wrong.
4 This is a very sexy suit. it took some time to figure out how to put it on. it needs instructions, but it is well worth it.
4 This top is really cute - a light sweater with a feminine lace detail. i would recommend it if you're looking for a flowy, feminine top to wear before it gets really cold out. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because the material is a little prone to pulls and snags. i wore it once and got a pull from my cross body bag. thankfully, i was able to manipulate the threading and the pull is almost unnoticeable. but just know that it's a pretty delicate sweater and you'll have to be careful
4 My retailer location only had the blue option, which i found to be very appealing and better in person for the following reasons:__________pros:- lighter knit like others mentioned.- the blue is a deep blue with threads of shimmery black that give it a more elegant touch while still being casual. i didn't see the grey, so i cannot compare the two differences, but i found the blue color lovely.- this looks much better in person!- it sat well on my tall frame of 5'9", 36 c, wide hips, and hour
4 This was really big on me. i am usually a 10 and even the 8 wouldn't stay up around the chest. i would need to have straps sewn on to make this work. on the plus side, the material is absolutely gorgeous. rich, saturated color. too bad about the fit. maybe really busty girls will have better luck, but this is going back. too expensive to justify keeping it if i need to spend money having it remade/tailored.
4 Loved the design and legnth but the material was not a light and soft as i expected.  i would get this in another fabric.
4 Quality is excellent. i agree with another reviewer that the top runs large. i am usually a medium, but i was swimming in it. i live in alaska and would not know how to return it so i am just keeping it and wearing it on those cool lazy days. i'm sure it would still look classy because of the design.
4 Overall, i was pleased with this dress. i didn't love how the front wrap transitioned to the back. it is comfortable and versatile... it can be dressed up or down.
4 Straight out of the mail, this cozy soft adorable charming sweater was *full* of little pills. i love the embroidery, the swingy slightly oversized fit that doesn't overwhelm and the high snuggle factor. wish this came in other colors and was knitted with a less fussy yarn.
4 I ordered this dress, along with several others, for an upcoming wedding. this was my favorite of all of them as far as style; unfortunately it just didn't fit. i'm 5'2" 116lbs and my regular size 2 was slightly too long, the waist a bit too low, the shoulders a tad too wide. as a result it hung on me like on a hanger. i guess i would need a petite but alas does not appear to come petite...
4 I really like this dress. it is cute, but not too frilly. i purchased in the store and they only had a petite (i am 5'6", so not a petite), but it fit - a little short but not too crazy. can be dressed up or down. the material and the print are really lovely.
4 I love this tank top - it is perfect for work and dressing up a more casual outfit. the fact that it has small cutouts is cute and doesn't make it so you absolutely have to wear a tank under it in more casual situations. i love the colors and the boxy fit. great purchase!
4 I love this top! the color is quite unique (a reddish color), but the cut really makes it stand out. i love the square neckline. i feel it accentuates my bust without showing too must breast. i notice a number of other reviewers had an issue with the tightness around the bust: this top looks like it would have ample stretch in the photograph; however, in person you can see that the embroidered area does not have any stretch. for me, this was not an issue, as the top suited my body type well rega
4 This dress is extremely comfortable and easy to wear with a bra. the back is great and the length is perfect for me. it's flattering, but the pattern (being light in color across the middle) isn't particularly flattering on your waist. that being said though, the gathering in front is great for hiding bumps and whatnot (after 3 kids that's important to me). lightweight and great for summer. 5'8", 135lbs and the size s fit perfectly.
4 I like this sweater. i am 5'4", 125 lbs, and bought the xs. if i had to do it again, i'd buy the xxs. for a fitted cardigan it ran slightly big. it's a thin material- you would layer it over a tank or tee.
4 I love the design of this blouse. lots of pretty details. the slits on the side are high, but with a tank underneath, it's perfect. love the length of the sleeves and the modest, flattering neckline. the only problems so far are that the rhinestones are prone to falling out and snagging other parts of the top, so you have to be careful with movements and you can't wear a sweater with it because the rhinestones would snag it a lot. even if it loses the rhinestones, it's still a beautiful blouse,
4 I usually wear a medium but in this top probably could have pulled off a small however i was afraid the neck would be too tight.  was considering the small because the arm holes were a bit baggier than i would like.  no issue with my bra showing though.  i wasn't able to try on the small to test my theory since i purchased online.  overall i love the color (blue), the fabric is comfortable, definitely loose but i'm okay with that on a hot sunny day.
4 Love these pants, they do run small in the hip area and are not stretchy at all. so beware, if you are curvy, you might want to size up. great quality and style overall.
4 And runs large. i'm always a size 8 in dresses and the 8 was too big. i would buy it in a 6 if the color was closer to what i'm seeing online.
4 I ordered this top in white and i was really excited for it to come in! once it once delivered and i tried it on it took me a second to decide if i liked it or not. i think i ordered it a size too big (i ordered a large, i'm usually a medium). it was somewhat boxy, but i think paired with the right pants and shoes it would be just what i wanted!
4 I'm 5'10" and felt that it was just too short. otherwise - love it!
4 If you're expecting a sweatshirt when you order this, you might be disappointed. it's actually more like a banded t-shirt, which i don't mind. i'm 5'2" and the length comes just below the button on my jeans. perfect length for us shorter gals. sleeves are quite long on me, but i like to wear them pushed up anyways (and they actually stay up). i wouldn't pay full price for this, but it's a nice top at the sale price. cute with destroyed jeans or black leggings.
4 Fits true to size. good quality, style and length.
4 I love this sweater, especially the sleeves. i'm 5'2 and athletic so i don't' feel that it is the most flattering for my figure but i love it so much that i kept it!
1 I saw the photo of the young woman wearing this dress in the reviews and she looked beautiful, i on the other hand looked awful. the fabric of the entire dress is quite stiff, so the dress didn't move with me; it sort of felt as if i was wearing a paper cut out. then to contribute to the volume, the sleeve is not set in, it is a raglan style, that on me looked more like a bat suit, than what i was hoping for, a beautiful distinctive dress for an important affair. also the belt didn't enhance the
4 This coat looks great, but the fabric is thin--only partly wool. the snaps also don&amp;amp;#39;t stay shut very well; i&amp;amp;#39;ll probably add a hook-and-eye closure for security. despite its flaws, it looks good enough that it&amp;amp;#39;s a keeper (when purchased on-sale).
4 Love the colors! love the stripes! great shape! great style! but...i am normally a 12 on top...and this pulled across my back...so i have it in for an exchange for a 14. sometimes i have to do that...i have a broad back. we will see how it fits! but what an adorable shirt!
4 I see other reviewers are like me. we are wondering why antho has so many waistless, big, flowy tops! please! more tops with a defined waist! please!i love this top. it's a gorgeous color and a lot of work to it, very retro antho, not just a t-shirt like so many are these days. to my delight, it runs large. i usually wear a 14 or 16, but the store had a 12 in the sale room, and not only did it fit, but i plan to have my seamstress taper the waistline and cut off the "wings" that flare off on t
4 Nicely designed romper with an wide elastic waist band that can be worn on the hips or around the waist. not too short for this 60+ body and very comfy. i wear either a med. or large and went with large for this. a good buy.
4 Great jeans. especially since i'm getting tired of my skinny jeans. length is great for someone tall like me (5'10") unless you wear heels with them but these are more sneaker/sandal jeans.
4 Really cute top, comfy, with just enough flare that it can be dressed up a bit, or worn just casual. not clingy at all...in fact, maybe just a tad too flowy around the middle, but not so much that it kept me from going back to buy it immediately in a second color! i typically wear a large, but suspect the arms on the medium might be a tad small if i sized down.
4 Very cute and true to size if not just a little large up top.
4 I love this blouse. the color is so pretty! i might even wear this to a holiday party. the tie looks great so many ways--love the versatility. i think i will get a lot of wear out of this blouse--with a pencil skirt, jeans or under a blazer.
4 This top is really cute and i think will be a great transition piece. i'm glad i tried it on in the store as it runs very small. i typically wear a 00 or 0 and bought this in a 2. they didn't have it in stock,so i ordered it and hope it fits.
1 This blouse is a disappointment . fabric is cheap looking and the cut is very off. just odd. sleeves awkward . the back of the white shirt on the on-line model is not the same as the white shirt i received. mine was plain in the back like the blue shirt on line even though my shirt was white. no ruffle. returned.
4 It is a little boxy, but it?s not unflattering in my opinion. the sweatshirt material is soft, the ruffles keep their shape and position, and aren?t too overwhelming on my small frame. i like the small slits on the sides, they allow the sweater to drape nicely. it also hit at a flattering spot, a little below the hip. 5?1??, 100 lbs, and got the xxs petite. this fit true to size for me.
4 This dress is a lot of fun and would be great for a party or a wedding but unfortunately it didn't fit me right. i ordered a small since i usually wear a size 2 but the waist was just a little bit loose while the dress was too tight across the bust. this caused the dress to pull up in the front and make it look too high in the waist. i guess i'm just too busty for this dress. too bad because i really wanted it to work. it is a lovely dress.
4 I liked these as soon as i saw them. the are very comfortable and the fit is great. well constructed and the material is soft but thicker.. easily worn into the cooler days. i am so happy i made this purchase!
4 I saw this top online and read the reviews that it was running small. i am normally an xxs in most retailer clothing. i am 5'6 110 for reference. found it in the store and took both the xs and small in to try on. the reviewers were right! i tried the xs on first and it was quite snug and short. the small fit perfectly. it was a bit longer too. great style and soft fabric. once you size up, you'll love it...
4 I love the style of this dress and the color is beautiful and very much like the photo. like previous reviewers mentioned, the top is a little loose in comparison to the bottom. i originally bought a size 4 but then exchanged it for a 2. i tend to be between those sizes. the 2 fits great on bottom but the straps are a bit loose. it might be better for bigger busted ladies!
4 I wanted to love this skirt and i agree with the other reviewers. the color of the skirt is beautiful. i've never seen anything quite like it at retailer! the quality is superb and the material is fairly substantial given the brocade design. however, the skirt made my hips look a lot bigger than they are because the shape of the skirt is more of a tulip-design. i purchased an 0 petite (because my normal size 00 petite was sold out) and while the waist part fit the hip part was disproportionately l
4 The overall color of this dress is more buttery white and the pale golden embroidery almost blends in.therefore i think the dress benefits from being styled . i tried bold colored scarves with fringes and big statement jewelry. this dress is more casual with its fringes , the jeans like material ( although softer than cotton) as well as the loose pullover style. it is easy to dress down with a blue jean jacket, casual sandals or even sneakers. i have a 38 c chest and the l fits almost too loos
4 The material is soft. it looks perfect with ankle jeans or flare jeans.
4 I am 34dd. bought sz med and have plenty of room up top. the black motif is really a dark, purple/blue. slightly sheer. the length on the med is 251/4 from bottom of collar (the collar adds 1 1/4") the length does not cover my bum like the model , covers 2/3rds, nor does it appear as long in front.
1 The top looks better on the model than in-person. it fits loose and looks boxy and matronly. i don't like the sleeve length or the top style, it just didn't look flattering or good. i am sending it back. looks very boxy.
4 I finally broke down and went on a christmas shopping spree at retailer for myself with hubby in tow as they are gifts from him.the skirt is a beautiful dark navy, super soft knit. very long with a texture pattern. i am 5'9" and have put on a few pounds lately but typical wear and 8/10 and bought the large because i didn't want to try it on. it works for me because i don't like skirts to cling to much. even my pencil skirts i like a more loose fit. normally id say a medium would probably f
4 They were fine. i had hoped they'd be more like begging a though... more structure. they were very much just leggings and rather unflattering in the crotch area. they felt well made though. might work for someone else. not a bad legging.
1 I ordered the ivory of this dress, expecting it to be a nice dress i could wear into my second trimester of pregnancy. instead, i received a dress that looks like a ugly, vintage-gone-wrong curtain of fabric. the 'ivory' is the color of yellowed newspapers. the fabric was cheap and had thread pieces sticking up all over the place. i would've been better off sewing myself a dress out of drapes a la gone with the wind or sound of music. the fit isn't that great, either. big and boxy. it could acco
4 Very cute and comfortable! can be wear with tights and boots or into spring with flags! very flattering fit for someone with smaller upper body them bottom half!!
4 The fabric is quality, nice thicker fabric. the fit was strange, the top part fit great through the arms and shoulders, except my bust makes the front stick out and results in a maternity look. it was also slightly wide, i considered taking it in on the sides. ultimately it wouldn't be worth the money. it would be a great top for someone with a smaller chest.
1 I am floored by all of the positive comments about these culottes! i can see that they would work for someone who is rail thin and has no hips... but for those of us with curves (i'm a size 12, hourglass), these are very unflattering. they made me look like i was carrying an extra 20-30 pounds, just around the hips! so bummed because they look so cute on the model.
4 Medium is equivalent to eu size 40. the pants have the eu tag and i would have ordered differently if i had known this. great quality pant; just order according to your european equivalent.
4 This was a miss for me. the armholes are too low, it's lined and heavy. way too long. just didn't wow me. the lace is sturdy and beautiful, though.
4 Just tried this dress on in the store and ordered a petite because i'm 5'. if you are even 5'2" or taller i wouldn't recommend a petite fit unless you prefer the tunic length. this dress and material has a flattering drape for those of us with trouble belly regions.
4 This cute dress is swingy and chock full of fun little details.  love the embroidery, colors, crochet lace, tassels, wide sleeves.  don't like that it's all polyester and some embroidery is unraveling so i don't know what to do about that.  size down if your petite or slender.  i'm a med-large (135# 36c 38-27-35) and medium fit great at the bodice/shoulders.  hem hits my knees in regular size.
1 This is a beautiful kimono but just isn't made well. the one i received already had a couple small holes and a pull in the thread that was very noticeable. after reading the additional reviewer who wore it an hour and it was already pilling, it is going back for good. such a shame!
4 I wanted to love this dress - everything about it was so beautiful - except the fit , the length, the neckline ... i tried on a 4, 6 and petite 4. i'm 5'5" 130 32dd - the top of the dress runs small/tight - so i needed to try it on without a bra.the length on the regular is to the floor/with the petite to my ankles. the print was beautiful and like in the photo, it flowed nicely but there was just too much fabric - maybe it was just the design for me - it did nothing for my figure at all
4 This is a beautiful tunic. the colors are vibrant and the stitching is high quality. please note that the insets on the sides are not actual stitching but a print. it is still very pretty. please size down a size. i am usually a large, wearing a 12 or 14 if something runs tight across the bust, i ordered a large and it is a bit big under the arms but too big through the waist area. i am not small in this area either.i would recommend buying this tunic.
4 I am 5'4, 34c, with a pear shape. this dress fit me perfectly in a medium (30 inch natural waist). i had to use a safety pin to keep the bosom from gaping too much, so a smaller chested person would likely not have any issues. however, the material and design were perfectly pinup and work appropriate, so i was willing to make adjustments for it.
1 I thought this dress would be a cute beach cover up so i was excited to order it but i was very disappointed. i am 5'7 and i usually wear a size small top and 4 dress so i ordered a small in this dress but it was huge!! i understand that it is not meant to be form fitting and i wasn't expecting it to be but when i tried this on i felt like i was wearing a potato sack. i feel like an extra small would have been just as bad. i was so upset. it also has thin silver lines through it which, for me, m
4 I ordered the red motif online in my current size 10. the fabric is so beautiful, even prettier than the online photo. the fit is not great on me. it made me look wider at my chest area and almost catches at my hips (i'm sure shapewear would take care of this). the dress looks really good with a jacket or vest but just weird by itself. i agree with the other reviewer who said it was a little short - i'm 5'9". it looks good standing up but is very short when i sit. there's no real stretch to the
1 This dress really was huge, and not at all flattering. i don't know how they got it to look good on the model in the picture. material was nice and soft, but i really don't see how anyone could look good in this, no matter what your body shape is.
4 This dress caught my eye because of the beautiful fabric, but i read the reviews online so i didn't buy it. i just went to a store and couldn't help but try on the size small. i usually range from an xs to a s, and i would say that the size s fits great around my shoulders. it is true what the other shoppers say about this dress being like a tent. it is and i won't lie about that. when i tried it on, i asked a sales person to bring me some belts to try on to create a waistline. once i put on a b
4 I bought these in the navy stripe and they're soft and comfortable. i'm between a small and a medium and the medium works here -- i could not have worn a small in these. the narrow stripes make the pants flattering and the drape is lovely. i wish they had pockets but i guess i can't have everything!
4 A very pretty pair of over-the-knee socks. i purchased the dark grey color, which has a metallic silver thread running through it. a nice subtle but glitzy touch. the knitted pattern is intricate and nicely done. i'm 5' 4" and they do come up well above the knee. if you are walking quite a bit, they don't stay above the knee, but they do seem to stay just below the knee. because the yarn is fairly thin they don't look bunchy even if they come down a bit. i have very sensitive skin, and metallics
4 Material is nice, great for a party or date night. fits true to size, (l for me, i'm a 12). would recommend. the bell sleeve is right on trend and very tasteful.
4 I love the way this coat looks in the website. it turned out to be a little different than i thought it would be. can't decide if i will keep it.the sleeves are bracelet length, i have long arms so slightly awkward for me. i ordered the small even though i wear a medium in everything else (5'8", 135 #). so glad i did because it is biggish on me.it is unlined but made of a lovely, soft wool. the edges are all finished with a bias edging which is unique and well done. it is boxy, very.lovely wo
4 The dress i received is adorable, however, the color is much more subdued than shown in the catalog.
1 I so wanted to love this suit. it was gorgeous - the color, the quality, the style, but i am returning and can not recommend it. the sides need to be connected just a little bit higher and i think it would work, but there is no way you could move around in this without things popping out in front. i mean it would be gorgeous to just lay there in the sun, but i didn't feel like i could even walk safely, and i am not well-endowed. very bummed but it's going back.
1 These are horrible pants!!! they run small in the thigh and butt like other cartonnier crops. look great at first....after a few hours of wear the stretch out everywhere!!! absolutely terrible! i have several pairs of cartonnier crops that are my "go to" pants, but these are not worth even the sale price! i'd give them no stars if i could!! this fabric is very different from my other printed pairs. if u must try them, size down and suffer through the first few "tight" hours! trust me...they will
4 This is a great top. it does run a bit large but it's intended to be flowing. i got so many compliments the first time i wore the top and its actually quite flattering! great purchase, especially on sale!
4 I'm 5'8" small 115 pounds. ordered the xs. this dress is gorgeous! my husband loved it! i tried several sticky bras... nothing worked. i'm 32dd i gave up. if your ok with no support, you'll love this dress. sexy back, perfect length, so light!
4 I love the skirt! the color is beautiful, but i didn't love the fabric. it's too delicate and not great for a mom with two busy boys.
4 The wide leg was fun, not too wide, but the long pocket seem to shorten leg so i returned. great for a taller person. bottom & trim cute
4 Such a pretty blouse, drapes nicely though it is a little on the large side. i got my usual medium and had to fix the straps a few times, but a fun summer top that makes you feel super feminine. maybe i could have sized down but i got it online on clearance so i didn't have the chance to try on another size. still love it!
4 First of all, i've noticed that maeve is running big, i'm normally a size medium or 6 and two occasions now i've needed a size small and this is no different. of course i ordered the medium and would need to exchange it if i want it to fit better. it's loose allover. the only reason i'm not exchanging it is that the color washes my olive skin color. other than that it's a beautiful dress, it hist at the same spot on the leg as in the model's pictures. for reference, 5'9", 36b, 29", 38".
4 I was pleasantly surprised when i tried on this sweater. it is well made and fit perfect. the will really enjoy weather this in the fall.
1 I was really disappointed when i tried this top on. the design and cut of the neckline is very bulky and just off. the cut of the top overall was just off.
4 This top is so soft and luxuriously comfy! i love wearing it around the house, haven't really "dressed" it up yet with jeans or jewelry. it runs slightly big, but if you like the oversized look, this is definitely perfect.
1 Too tight in strange ways. beautiful dress i was so excited to receive it, however it just did not fit.
4 This velvet t-shirt is perfect for the holidays! i usually wear a size 12 top, or a l, but i ordered up and got a size xl. it is very tight around my chest (36c) and armpits, and the v-neck sometimes spreads apart a lot if i move my arms around a lot. but other than that, it looks great, just runs small. if you are a size 14 or larger, i don't think that this will fit.
4 I ordered the black and it was a soft black, which i loved. i felt like the shirt was a little boxy (i was hoping the top would have been a bit more fitted (the arm holes are loose) and the bottom a little longer, but i like it enough that i am keeping it. works well to wear to work.
4 It's a pretty top, but it runs very short. the back is also pretty see through so i'm not sure i will keep it. it's called off the shoulder but it is so tight when you try and actually wear it off the shoulder. great design, just not sure i will keep it due to length
4 I ordered this dress in 0p since i am 5ft. it fits great its not too short just above the knee.
4 The beautiful bold print drew me to this top and it did not disappoint upon receipt. however, the bottom ruffle belled so far out on each side that it was laughable! the actual fit is nothing like the picture; clearly the model's arms are placed in front of all the extra fabric to hold the ruffle back.however, the fabric is beautiful, the fit was perfect (size 2, 5'4", 106 lbs.), the quality is great and i love the print so i decided to take it to my tailor to "sew away" the "wings" on both si
4 This is a very pretty, particularly youthful dress.  but, do be forewarned, it is gigantic.  size down even if you never do, and get a petite if you are even a little short.  i didn't size down enough and it was both wide and long -- it looked ridiculous.  i am petite, and the hem went way below my knees (and the dress was considerably longer than the slip).
4 Tried this one because the ruffled detailing at the collar and sleeves appealed to me, as well at the cute button details along the back and the overall color and look of it._____________pros:- love the ruffle trim along the collar, bottom, and wrists. it gives it a really romantic feel to it.- a definite winter piece. it's extremely warm and very thick and heavy, which i found covered any lumps and bumps nicely.- ran tts. i'm 5'9", 36c, hourglass, and 170 lbs and tried on the medium and fo
4 Cute spring dress. fit can be a little challenging if you have a full bust. however, print is so beautiful. the material is soft. i liked the puff in the sleeve. it made the look more unique.
4 I got this on sale. i sized up from my normal 10 to a 12 based on reviews. the 12 is too large for me and i'd need a 10 which is sold out. the straps are very long. i think even if i sized down, i'd have to have them altered. also, the dress i got is missing the bottom button. sending back. i'm not too sad, i ordered the pink pippa swing dress with the same order and love it.
1 I saw this sweater on-line and loved it until i tried it on. i'm 5-7, flat chested, 135 pounds and i ordered a size small. the sweater fit everywhere except for my arms. this sweater will work great if you are short. consider making your sweaters a little longer, because i do not consider myself tall.
4 The dress is cute, but i'm somewhat concerned that it will be sheer in the sunlight. i guess we'll have to wait and see!
4 Love the unique stitching on the shirt and the dye job.  i think it does run a little big.  the arm holes are quite deep even in a medium, but the fabric is thin so a tank underneath would probably work out well.
4 Saw this skirt in the sale room and figured i'd give it a try. i'm always looking for comfortable skirts that aren't too tight around the waist. once i zipped it up, i knew it would be a keeper! the waist band is super comfortable and it has a hook/eye closure as well. the material is a little heavier weight, but that's fine it can work for winter as well. it's soft, yet structured. the pockets are always a plus. if you want to step away from the normal shapes and colors, this is out of the box
4 I am normally a medium and i would take an xs in this top - i actually tried a m, s and xs and the xs fit but was still big. yes, this is supposed to be a loose draped piece, but for me, i didn't want it to make me look like i was huge through the waist line. the red is really pretty, the white is see thru.
4 Love these jeans! so comfortable and the high waist is great for my long torso. these are real denim, not the thin stretchy legging type jeans. they fit true to size on me-  i am 5'4" 120 pounds and i wear a 26. they were a little long so i chopped them off to hit just above the ankle
4 This is a very cute and unique top!! i absolutely love the back, which makes up for my indifference of the front. i'm a little heavier in the middle, so it hides it a bit, but the light blue from the back that shows on the sides makes me feel a little wider. it's not perfect, but i like it enough to keep it. i got lots of compliments on it when i wore it. it's very comfortable too. i just wish the front had a little more to it or was a tad longer. overall very happy.
4 This shirt is very flattering on. it's perfect to wear to work and also in a casual setting. it is rather short so it would be best to pair it with high rise pants!
4 Shimmery & lightweight t-shirts. i got the aqua & brown t's. good for layering.
4 This is a beautiful knit dress, however it runs large, so be wary. for reference i am a 34d, 28 inch waist, and 41 inch hips. i ordered a medium because dresses usually run tight around my bum, and it was very, very big. i'm hoping the small is much more flattering because the quality of the knit is very nice.
4 Perfect sweater to throw on with anything. it is fairly thin, i wore a cami underneath. the sleeves and hem are rolled. you have to be careful and it can snag easily. happy with my purchase.
4 Im normally a medium across the board for outerwear. (5'8" and 135 lbs) this jacket looked giant from the photos so i bought a small. when i first tried it on i thought no way, it's gotta go back. it was enormous and the fit was rather awkward. i looked like the size of a house from all angles. ha! i was still in love with the color and print. as i wore it around the house it began to loose it's rigidity and form against my body in places. it is definitely a jacket you got to play around with. d
1 I'm a petite so as usual i have to order from retailer. i saw this on line and tried it on in a regular size in the store. even though of course it didnt fit, the style of the tee was nice so i ordered it. i couldnt have been more disappointed when i received it. the quality was truly awful. i'm not even sure why it is being sold. the neckline was warped and wouldn't lie flat again the neck or chest; the bottom hem was crooked. it was really bad. also having purchased tees in similar material befo
4 These shorts are divine. the fabric is sturdy and there is a weave of sparkle that i did not perceive from the picture.
4 I wasnt expecting this top to be so soft and comfortable and breezy! i am usually an xs petite, but based on reviews i got the regular small. it is a little loose, but the length is perfect. i am short for reference (5'2, 107 lb, 32c). the buttons gaped a very tiny bit, like a centimeter, but not to the point where any skin or bra was visible. had i got the xsp, i think the gaping would have been an issue. the arms are too baggy for my taste (length is ok though), but i fold the sleeves up at th
4 I am 5'8" size 4-6 us. i could barely zip the inside bra on the 8. i wear 34 b. i think it is uk sizing. i kept the 8 ( had to return the 6). it's a beautiful dress but it is a lot of dress. maybe too much for someone more petite. it looks ridiculous until you put the belt on:)
4 More flattering than it looks on the model. comes in at the waist on me. i ordered it in blue, and it's very pretty; will go nice with a business suit but requires a cami underneath for work occasions.
4 This dress fits well and is comfortable. my only reflection is that i am 5'9" and it hits at my mid shin, rather than where it appears on the model.
4 Agree with other reviewers : this dress is surprisingly nice weight/quality fabric. it's also very swingy. i find i am usually a size 10 in hd in paris items (m in deletta and s/m in meadow rue, for comparison) since i'm a 34d i find hd in paris items to leave too little room for larger busts so i size up. in this dress i'm going to try for the m, since the l i ordered was too big, the swingyness leaves lots of room if you are an hourglass shape and the sleeves were roomy without being too big.
4 Colors are vibrant (i ordered the blue color combo) material is light and feels great against your skin.
4 Basic ribbed white tank with a little character in the back. could easily be dressed up or down, material is soft and light and has a slight stretch. i will be getting a lot of use out of this piece.
4 Loved this blouse when i received it after ordering online! the cut and style of the blouse is so cute and looks great with jeans. it is well made but it is see-through so i had to wear something under it. otherwise, really flattering, unique design!
4 This reminds me of a kimono or poncho rather than a "cardigan" but that aside its a beautiful sweater. the feel of it is luxurious and is soft and comfortable. i would size down at least one size. i'm usually a medium to large and i bought the small. i gave this piece 4 stars because it is a touch boxy. it's seems like a piece i'll throw on with jeans and wear to a casual dinner in the fall. definitely a fall/winter item.
4 This would be one of my favorite shirts if the neckline were straight across instead of cut, or if it at least had a button. it runs large so the low neck plus bagginess makes it feel too loose for my taste, even though i ordered the xs. the back of the sweater is also really long. it's a comfortable fabric and nice quality though.
4 Got several compliments on the dress the first time i wore it, and know it will work well for both the office, church and even a holiday party or two. i'm right on the line between petite & regular sizes, and could have gone w/a petite (probably medium) size instead as the dress is just a touch long with a deeper neckline for my frame. otherwise it fits well and the color is great, even if it's not quite the same as in the photo. overall, i'm satisfied with my purchase!
4 This dress is attractive but it runs a little small. i'm a small curvy girl who usually wears a 2. this was small in the top and short waisted. i wanted to wear it to a recent event and didn't have time to return it for another size.
4 Fit review: i ordered the size 27 as i read alexa chung jeans run small, and my usual size in ag stevie is a 26 in cords, 27 in some jeans..i'm 5'2", currently 25" waist, 33" high hip, 37.25" at the widest, 29" inseam. i have more of a pear shape than an hourglass, flatter stomach, bigger upper thighs and bottom. i'm long-waisted and do have some high-rise trousers that look great, which is why i risked paying shipping on these..the 27 was loose at my natural waist, the jeans measuring 29.5"
4 Pilcro runs one size smaller this year - i compared with pants that i ordered last year and sure enough, one inch difference in waist. i did not notice difference in other dimensions of this garment, so my best guess is that pilcro decided to make tighter waist due to some complaints last year about waist being ?too lose?. i personally prefer sporty silhouette and am not thrilled with this change, but pants fit and are nice color and quality, so they stay. however, i am not sure i would order th
4 I adore this top - so cute, flattering, and easy to dress up or down. yes, it is a little better suited for larger chests, but i personally don't mind a discreet pin for this beauty. i'm a 34a and slim build, and the only issue is when i bend forward - it falls beautifully otherwise. great with everything from a black pencil skirt to jeans and a black leather jacket...cute with denim jacket and white pants too. easy wardrobe piece.
4 The top does run large around the upper waist area. arms fits perfectly for athletic shoulders and biceps! the sleeves come about 4 inches shy of the wrist. the embroidery is lovely and the material is very soft but is pretty thin. overall i am very happy that this tunic is actually a tunic! the length goes below the butt and is a very cute buy.
4 I like this tunic. it is quite long and print in blue looks good with the butterflies. it feels very hot though! maybe better for winter. the sleeves are linen, i usually don't like linen much, it feels scratchy. this top works better in colder weather due to the sleeves and length of top. more like a tunic. i recommend it but am sending it back because i need something for summer.
1 I tried this shirt in a small (my usual retailer size) and it was very unflattering.   the fabric was ultra soft and it seemed it was nicely made.  however, this shirt is so unstructured and oversized, i might as well worn a brown paper bag.
4 This cover up has great potential. i love the embroidery. the colors and design are great. however, it has a number of loose strings. it makes me wonder what might happen when i wash it. the fabric is on the thinner side, but it is not see through. the fabric would be nice for a hot day by the pool. i caught it on sale, so i am keeping it.
4 Great leggings! they're well made and comfortable to wear. my only complaint is that they seem to be stretching just a little and don't fit perfectly.
4 Love the pattern of this tunic. it's comfy and unique.
4 Great quality- this sweater runs small and not as long as pictured in the catalogue. it's perfect over a longer undergarment underneath or over a sleeveless dress. i love the color & quality. i ordered on line & decided to keep it, yet wear it differently than i originally thought.
4 I was surprised at how soft this sweater is. i thought for a brief moment it was cashmere. i'm a little worried it might pill. we shall see!it is a pretty and classy sweater. will look great with jeans and heels or boots.it looks somewhat long on the model. it wasn't quite as long on me, which was a bit disappointing. i'm 5'7 with long torso (not abnormally long!). it's still a great sweater and will be great for upcoming holidays parties!
4 Looks nearly exactly like the picture. will be very comfortable to wear. i ordered a petite large and could really have worn a medium. it's big all over. i figure i'll do a little tailoring on this come spring and adjust the fit. on the whole, happy.
1 The tops looks fitted on the model because she pressed her arms against the clothes. to my surprise,the tops actually is very very very r o o m y below the chest area.the appliques/laces on the front are made of low quality materials.
1 I bought the black and gray fleece lined leggings. i thought the price was great. too good to be true. you get what you pay for. once i opened the box they smelled awful. it was a chemical smell. i washed the black pair twice and it was a little better. i have washed the gray 5 times and it still smells.
4 It actually is a pretty good t-shirt, but i wish that i had known that "white" actually means oatmeal with bits of grey and beige. i bought three and will now need to return them all. hopefully i can find it in other colors i like.
4 I love this style of tank top with the wider straps. very flattering but yes the armholes are big and i noticed the sizing is different with each color. i normally wear an xs but in the gray and blue i bought s to have a little room. i also bought the black color but the s was huge! i exchanged for an xs so hopefully it will fit better. it had to be ordered. it definitely stretches out as you wear it though.
1 The back of the shirt has a tag stitched in with red thread that goes through to the outside of the shirt. it is very visible and looks terrible - especially since the back is the focal point of the shirt. do not recommend
4 Ordered this in my usual medium, knowing it was meant to be over-sized. but i could easily have put another of me (138 lbs. with junk in the trunk) inside it! so i'm returning it for a small, feeling sure that there'll still be enough extra for a slouchy look.
1 And the bottom looks like a tutu. first, i have high tolerance for scratchy fabric but this one i could feel it even through long sleeves. there is no way i could wear something that makes my skin itch so badly. second, the peplum part is huge and looks like an exaggerated skirt. finally, the color on the "green one" is darker than in the picture and it does have more of a green than blue tint. back it goes.
1 Ugh, the fit of this dress is terrible :/ what a beautiful dress though -- the material and the colors -- had so much potential. but, the fit is awful -- i ordered by regular size and the top was more or less ok, if not a tad big, but hip down was crazy tight that i couldn't even zip it without a ton of effort. i don't think sizing up will help because then the top will be even bigger. disappointing.
4 I wear an xxs petite and this dress was still large. i like that look so i'm okay with that but the sides do stick out a little bit if you have a smaller frame.
4 I have the t shirt from last year and i love it so could not wait to try the dress. why didn't you make it in petite? it can work with some tailoring but petite sizing esp since this runs on the big side, would have been ideal. love the navy, will try the white. how about some more colors and petite?? please??? more t shirt dresses in general too please!!
4 The shirt fits nice and has a classic cut. i would imagine this to look good on just about anyone. the shirt is soft and comfortable, but is rather thin and see through. the stitching is coming undone a little bit in some areas. wouldn't pay full price for it, but it's worth it on sale.
1 I loved this dress online and was luckily able to locate it in a store about an hour away from me. i drove to the store to purchase it; however, when i tried it on, i was so disappointed! the print is adorable and it is made of great quality, but the swing style is definitely more than mini! i could have fit 3 of myself in this dress. it is definitely not as depicted in the photographs. also, the background of the dress is way more pink than appears in the photos, and the floral print isn't as r
4 Bought this dress on sale - i haven't decided if i'm going to keep it yet or not, because i'm not sure if it's flattering to my bubble butt. i normally wear a 6-8 in retailer (5'6" 135 lbs thin limbs 38-26-38). i ordered this dress in a size 4 regular and i find the length perfect with flats or with heels. i also find the bust area, waist and hips accommodating without being tight, which usually never happens. for this current sale price, this is a gorgeous dress made with beautiful material.
4 I purchased this dress in the red/orange color and was impressed by the quality of the fabric. the waist sat a bit higher on me that in does in the picture, so it looks much more like an empire waist on me.
4 I tried this top on in-store in red and lavender. i love it! yes, it is big, but it is still really cute. if you are between sizes, go down a size. i am 5'5" 34b and went with an xs in the red. it appears to fit in the front but looks larger in the back, which i think the other reviewer was getting at.
4 The skirt is beautiful, but the sizing is kind of off. i usually wear a 6, at 5'6" and 130 lbs. i ordered an 8, though, since sometimes athropologie clothes run small. even the 8 was too tight, so i'll have to exchange it.
4 Ordered the shirt online. beautiful print and good quality material. runs very large - size down 1 may be 2 sizes as the material on the body is very wide. i will be exchanging it in the store.
4 This is a nice basic solid top with the extra appeal of textured detail around the shoulders and back. the v-neck is flattering. this top can work with many different outfits. i only wish my store carried the petite length, as the regular was too long for me.
1 The title says it all....this fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design. the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials (shoulder is a knit, sweater-like navy fabric) is interesting. however, that is where the positive comments end on this one. the top is so scratchy,, stiff, and, frankly, uncomfortable. i cannot imagine wanting to wear it. it could benefit from a lining, and that might have solved the problem of scratchy, itchy fabric.the stiff fabric of the bo
4 I ordered:xspxxsxxspxxsp was the better fit, some people loved it some didn't like as much (thought it was baggy and are not used to seeing me in baggy clothing. but that being said, ti was comfortable, the cutouts fell right on spot on my shoulders, and it is a nice casual embellished look half tucked in some boyfriend jeans. i reordered mine as it had something stuck on it and it bothered me (like sticky white) i will re-evaluate when i get the new order only because there are sooo m
4 I am 5'4 and 120 lbs and ordered a size 0. the dress fit perfectly in the shoulders and arms and below the waist, but i could barely fit my 32a size chest in the dress! the other reviewers are not kidding about the chest area being very narrow. i have had to order a size 2 instead. we'll see if that works.
4 Love this shirt with leggings. if you are in between sizes- size down
4 This one totally worked for me. love the color, length, and style.
4 I ordered a 6 and it fit great i am 5ft 3" and 130lbs 34b in the chest! i love the fabric, i was drawn to it because i don't think it will wrinkle and crease as easily as other fabrics. it is a flattering cut and is very beautiful in person. the embroidery makes the dress unique.
4 I on the other hand wore these once and boy did they stretch during the day! i really hope they shrink back up...
4 I got so many compliments on this the first day i wore it. i think of this more like a sweater coat than a regular sweater. it is extremely soft and warm, but not bulky at all. it lays really neatly, which is why i think of it more like a coat. this will definitely be a staple moving into the winter and then into spring. keep in mind though that this does not button - they're just for show.
4 The skirt has a great cute design and great colors and great shape. but it runs very small and short. this company needs to provide a better fit, and large sizes if they run small.
4 The jacket runs large so size down. it's a good jacket to throw on the go. but i don't see this lasting long bc after he first wash, it started piling. the quality of the material isn't great!
4 This is a very nice, flattering thing which can be worn as a dress or a shirt. therefore decided tiokeep it.
1 Similar to others here, these pants were ruined after one wash. the first pair i bought simply faded after one wash, which was okay, but the second pair got weird splotches on the backside. i'd rather not call attention to that particular area of my body;) could've been a great addition to my wardrobe if they were better quality.
4 It's a nice drop-waist, embroidered, lightweight dress for summer. my problem was that the armholes were too large for me and i found that to be unflattering. it's a swing style so it's forgiving in the hips and belly.
4 This t-shirt does a great job of elevating the basic t-shirt in to one with a touch of flair. i typically wear a medium but luckily read earlier reviews and went with the small.
4 The top is so soft, and the lace detail in the backs makes this your no-so-average chambray top. the fit is flattering for a curvy figure.
4 I tried this cute black dress on in the store and even in the xs it was a little too big. i'm 5'3", so if they had petites available in the store maybe they would have fit better. just found too much material around the middle even though it is meant to be a loose fitting dress. the material is heavy weight, very stretchy, but not a thick fabric. could be great in the summer.
4 This is theoretically a great summer top addition to your wardrobe. i love the floral print - it's bold and lively primary colors on a black background. i'm usually a size small in retailer tops and neither the small nor the medium fit me very well. the small was a bit too fitted everywhere and strangely, the medium gapes at the front when i'm sitting but not standing (i'm 34b otherwise height-weight proportionate with broad shoulders). another reviewer mentioned a design flaw - the floral print i
1 Too much material everywhere. i am 122lbs 5'4" and i ordered an xs as usual. i was overwhelmed in a blanket of knitted material of muted colors. nice green slip, though. i will return it asap. this is super-ugly.
4 I got the white with black print and it is nice material and a pretty dress. i just would have preferred a better cut but overall pretty work dress .
4 I am normally an xs or s in tanks, so ordered the size 6. looks pretty much on me as in the pic. love that it's a cotton denim but it doesn't have any stretch. love the look & the fabric, but the neck area feels slightly restrictive in the front & i think it wld creep up & pull on me when wearing. fabric is slightly stiff & the flared bottom just sticks out. armholes do cover the bra & length hits at the top of the hips on me. going to return the 6, but will try the 8 if the local store has it.
1 First problem-i would not have ordered this at all had the description been correct. the fabric description is cotton which the dress is most certainly not. secondly, it has a really funky, cheap, unfinished, raw-hemmed slip which is simply not fitting for the dress. the keyhole in the front is super long-again, does not seem to fit the dress. i am not happy with this piece at all but it did fit tts. length is just above knee. i am 5'5" 142 lbs 34d and the six was a good fit. sending this home t
4 This dress is exactly what i was looking for. i have a very business casual job but wearing jeans and blouses can get boring so i'm constantly on the lookout for easy, go-to dresses that i can throw on year round with flats, booties, sandals, etc. this dress is exactly what i had in mind and i look forward to wearing it in the fall/spring with booties and in the winter with tights.
1 I was looking for a really warm, but stylish coat that i could wear when the weather is frigid as it sometimes gets here in the dc area. i tried on a size small, which is my usual coat size. while the coat fit, it was not flattering. for reference i am 5'9" 128 pounds and usually wear a small/xsmall in retailer tops. in this coat i looked like a linebacker with pads on. the front material is doubled, which makes you look like you have a large protruding stomach. the shoulders are bulky and
4 Great feeling trench. can dress it up or down.just be prepared to take a steamer with you. it comes wrinkled and will wrinkle very easy.
4 This top has a beautiful pattern, and the color is gorgeous - just like the photo. it is very thin, but under a sweater or blazer in the fall/winter would be perfect. it is a little big! i would order a size down.
4 I love this dress, but i am 5'7" and a size 12, so am a bit curvy. this dress was great on the bottom, but the way that he did the top of it made me look even more busty than i am. i returned it for that reason. however, if he would make that "skirt" as a stand alone, i would buy in a second.
4 Cute top, good color, fabric is a little rough and scratchy
4 Love this dress - haven't worn it yet but wow the design / artwork of the fabric is beautiful !! waiting for weather to cool off a bit so can wear with my off white suede gogo boots ....
4 Tried on & bought in-store. so cute & flattering; the picture doesn't do it justice. great neutral piece (more beige than ivory in person). looks cute tied or untied. i'm 5'3" and 120 lbs and the regular size s fit perfectly (not too snug, not too loose, and just long enough to cover my bum.)
4 This dress was overall cute, but you have to have an olive/darker complexion or a nice tan to really pull it off because it is such a pale pink. i'm very fare, but normally can do light punks, but this one just clashed. it does run pretty true to size. if you're on the edge between a smaller or bigger size, i recommend the smaller size however. hope this helps y'all!
4 I am 5'4", 145 pounds, 34dd and ended up with the size small for reference. it fit well but definitely roomy - in case you're not into that style. never tried the extra small, but i would prefer this dress not to hug onto me so i stayed with the small. this dress was really nice and comfy, soft material. the pockets are low and my phone stayed in while i walked but i wouldn't recommend anything heavier than a phone to go in the pockets. i wore this to a family and friends function and re
4 Tried on standard xs and the photo on-line is slightly misleading as i thought that there were more colors involved in the embroidery pattern. in person, the pattern is not as intricate with only 2 solid colors. the body of the shirt is light, airy/billowy, not as form grazing like on the model..which i don't mind. i still love the top but would have to go for a petite xs or even a petite xxs so that it would be a little more fitted all around. note that the embroidery on the dã©colletã© feels lik
4 This is a cute top, especially the material design. i like tops that go over my bottom and this does. if i had a problem it is with the sizing. the fact that it was only online so i could not try it on made it difficult to know really what size to get. some reviews said it was true to size and others said go down a size. i did go down a size but it still hangs a little big. but i still love the overall look. i am also petite which is what i ordered.
4 I recommend zooming in on the fabric as there are like ink streaks on it which at first i thought was a flaw but it is clearly shown--and is actually a nice touch to make these different!  the fit is true to size or a tiny bit small if you are curvy in the hips.  i wear a 10-12 and the l is fine but i wouldn't want them any smaller.  super lightweight the piping detail on the sides is really cute!
4 I was a bit worried when i took it out of the packaging but once i tried it on, all was well. it is a cute and comfortable outfit with enough detail to be stylish. i love rompers and this one is a great addition to the wardrobe.
1 This is more of an undershirt than a shirt. the material is very very thin and it shows everything. it was beyond unflattering on me. don't buy this unless you have a knockout thin body.
1 Bummed out.. this is super cheaply made and very expensive... the design is different , the color is beautiful, but the material is a different story.. it should be priced at the most 30 bucks.. not 128.. i'm returning them. also, they run very big..!
4 Love this shirt. i have it in black.  i have a larger chest, but i don't feel like the seams hit me wrong.  this is super cute and swingy.  i however think the price is way too high for a think cotton tee.
4 I do think the fabric could be a little more substantial for the price, and was disappoitned that even petites, were again, too long... the color is nice enough (neutral), and they definitely look like work pants. they are true to sice, but i could do the low end of my size range.
4 Great sweater, perfect weight for the office in the summer. love the delicate knit front and triple tie in the back. it was bigger and baggies than i was expecting, but it still works.
1 This is a rare review for me, i usually love my retailer purchases, even at times when other reviewers aren't fans, but this top is terrible. 5'4" 103, 32 b for reference, small frame, athletic, bought the xs in black. the length could have been longer, but i could have lived with the length. the arm hole area, however, a different story. because it's boxy, and the fabric is stiffer bc of the large flowers, the top sticks out on the sides under the arm holes leaving a gape, it did not fit snuggly
4 The only complaint i would have about this pullover is that it runs a little big. i ordered a small and it is a little big for my taste but it is not something worth returning it for. i wouldn't say to size down but be aware it is larger than what you would expect. still love it!
4 I don't like how short it is in the back.i also prefer a solid vs. slubby material, back it goes.
4 I love the long tunic with high slits, it's such a great design. i bought this on sale on a whim. i did see that there was already a small snag on the one i purchased right after i took it out of the bag, must have missed that when i looked at it in the store. i still love it, just a little worried based on other reviews that i won't be able to keep from snagging in the future. at the sale price i would say still worth it though!
4 This is one of the softest shirts ever! i agree with another reviewer about the shirt not worth the original price but once this shirt hit the sale item, totally worth it.
4 The embroidery around the chest/collar is lovely.  but the lower half of the shirt didn't fit my post-pregnancy bod.  it's going back.
4 This blouse is very pretty, but the overlap in the front is a little "strange." it seems to fall open and will require either a pretty pin to hold it closed or a cami underneath. despite that "flaw" i am glad that i purchased this blouse. the trim at the shoulders gives it a romantic and special appeal.
4 I've been scouting retailer's store, looking for short sleeved tops at a reasonable price point.this fit the bill. the flouncy sleeves are a bit much for my typical wardrobe, but a fun addition. i love the fact that there's extra fabric built in to make the armholes smaller, therefore no need for a cami underneath.i purchased the black and white in medium (typically medium to large, 5'4", 34g).
4 This dress is beautifully made, and has a lovely sheen to it. it's elegant and can be worn on different occasions. it's a very feminine dress. i ordered the dress in a few sizes and a size 2 fit me the best as i have a small bust line.
4 I would have loved this dress if the bust and waist were just a little more fitted. i am 32c and the top was too big. fit perfectly on hips. the lace material means it cannot be easily altered, so i chose to return the dress. i would have definitely kept it if it were a better fit.
4 I have another paper crown dress that is a favorite. this dress has the same quality and i love the print, which is somewhere between abstract and almost animal. unfortunately, the fit did not work for me. i am large-busted and need a bra. this dress cuts in at the shoulders and did not work with any of my bras except strapless. also, the waist cinches but without a defined band. this looked a bit more frumpy. again, i suspect the fault is in my figure, not the dress.for someone with a smaller
4 This is a great dress that i was eyeing for some time. i bought it after new year's with the 40% off discount. unfortunately the dress arrived with a defect so i have to have it fixed.the quality of the dress is amazing. the details are truly unique. one could tell that the dress is very well made. however, it does run large. i bought the xs and feel that i could have downsized at least one to two sizes! it's very comfortable and it could be dressed up or down.overall, im happy with the purc
4 I thought the design was adorable. i ordered up bc of reviews and i am glad i did. i am a size 6 so i ordered a size 8. the upsize is needed so u can get into the top part of the romper. otherwise it would be mission impossible. it's a pain to get on and off as all rompers are but it's soo cute it's worth it. had compliments on it the first day i wore it.
4 I like these pants. they fit nice but they are sheer which is not a problem for me. my only issue was that the print is not symmetrical as shown in the picture. the print is what drew me to these pants. the pattern is all over the place in the ones i received. they are nice so i will keep them at the sale price but i don't think they would be worth it at full price.
4 Ordered this dress online, and i love it! i was looking for an understated but fun new years dress and this was exactly what i was looking for. the only minor qualm i had about the dress was that the velvet dots that hit where the seams met made the dress look puffier than it should some parts around the waist, but for the most part, the dress fit very well and was very flattering, may just need a little bit of ironing. i am 5'9 and usually am more conscious of how things fit around my hips, and
4 I just got this top and can't wait to wear it for spring/summer! it is a lovely lightweight material and hangs loosely and comfortably. it definitely runs quite large so i would at the very least consider ordering on the small side of what you normally wear if not sizing down one completely. this is coming from someone who usually likes tops on the roomier side, so trust me on this! overall, i highly recommend this top if you're looking for a muted but unique, comfy top for the warmer months ahe
4 I love this sweatshirt. it's super chic and sexy (and for those of us that need actual support, it looks great with a strappy sports bra).  that said, selling this as "one size fits all" is misleading, at best.  i'm 5'2, ~160 (a lot of it muscle, but i enjoy chorizo), a 34ddd, and this fit me perfectly, but i can't imagine it would work for anyone much larger than a size 12.  just be real -- this is a smedium. one star removed for the "one size fits all" fallacy.
4 I love this shirt. i ordered a large because i am taller, and i wanted the length to be right. while it's a little baggy, it's still very flattering and i've received lots of compliments on it. the color is exactly what is show in the image. it's a versatile shirt; depending on what you pair it with it can be appropriate for work, dinner, or a night out. i'd definitely recommend this shirt to a friend.
4 Yes, this runs big but i sized down from med to small and it works. i like the gray/white pattern. received compliments upon first wearing and know i'll wear it often. i knocked off a star because of the rayon fabric which wrinkles so easily. this top always looks rumpled in the back from sitting. still i'm glad to have it in my fall wardrobe.
4 Runs a little big. fabric is very soft and comfortable
4 I first saw this dress in one of the stores and the rich colors caught my eye. this dress is very comfortable to wear but is also unique. the fabric feels great on and gives the dress an overall stylish flair. the photo doesn't do it justice!
4 This top is gorgeous!!! the picture just does not do it justice. i bought it solely based on the one review that said it looks very good. and it does! the velvet work at the top makes it look very dressy. the sleeves are not with big holes that show too much, the top and sleeves are perfect. i really like this top. i can't believe that the photo doesn't show it's gorgeousness, it looks so much better in-person. i so wish it came in more colors!!
4 The dress is lovely and fits true to size. i like the petite fit. i would note, however, the dress length does not match the description. the description states the dress falls 45" from shoulder. i measured it at 40 inches. it is definitely shorter than i was expecting.
4 It's an adorable take on the "casual" sweatshirt. i love the layers, but i wish they were just a little different. they hang a little strange. perhaps if the bottom one was a smidge longer? i'm not sure. or if the sweatshirt layer was a little longer and the blouse bit was therefore longer. it all hangs just a little...off? but, it's not so off that it looks bad. i'm petite, so it's cute on, but, i think if you were tall, it might hang a little weird. a warning though, i ordered a small, and the
4 I'm a size xl and i'm busty, so my review might not apply to everyone..i really wanted this jacket to work, however, it did not. i tried this jacket on in my usual size xl and it was nowhere near the correct size. this jacket runs small. i don't see how anyone with a bust is going to be able to button this jacket. the jacket is not lined and it is very fitted, so putting the jacket on and taking it off will require a very thin shirt to be worn underneath..the style of the jacket is very
4 Love love the print on these but the fit is off. i tried on the solid color in this same style and i took my regular size 30. these i needed a 12. the waist seems really small but the bottom leg parts stretch out and are kind of baggy after 1 wear. i can't go down a size because the waist was too small on the 10. since i love the print so much it may be tolerable. rare for hei hei to fit wonky.
4 Overall: a super comfy dress that you can wear anywhere. short, petite ladies beware though; the dress does not hang at your natural waist like it shows in the model's photos. in order for me to have it sit at my waist, the dress was folded over and did not flatter.
1 Just a ginormous, shapeless shirt. runs extremely large. i am normally a medium to large in shirts and the medium was huge. i can only imagine an xs would work and i am no xtra small!
4 I loved everything about this dress except the length. that fabric is great, the width of the dress was great...not too slim but not too baggy. but the front & side length was the problem. it is longer in the back which was great. i could have even dealt with the front length, but for my age, the way the sides came up fairly high, just couldn't work for me.i you are younger and okay with showing lots of leg, go for it! its really cute!
1 Not a pretty blouse - it's quite utilitarian in design - and it runs enormous.
4 This dress is so well made, but it's a lot of dress. i think i would have liked it if it were shorter. it felt a little too 50s housewife to me, and i was hoping for a flowing material. it wasn't worth the price to me so i sent it back.
1 This sweater was so itchy i immediately was turned off. it looks cute in pictures but another problem was that the knitting in the shoulders looks like a kid made it. it was uneven and stretched out. it looked like it was not well made to me. it also shed so much that just from me trying it on my pants were covered in orange fuzz. i returned this one.
4 First the good: what a beautiful, figure flattering dress. the fabric is stiff feeling, but the dress is well lined, so you can't see through it, and it hides lumps and bumps well. feels very quality. the lining also means it isn't scratchy. the stripes are very figure flattering for apple shapes like me (i'm 5'5", 165 and thick through the waist...this dress gives me the illusion of actually having a waist. l fit perfectly), and i love the saucy little cut out over the knee: not so high that yo
4 I'm a slightly pear shaped girl. a c chest with size 14 hips. the dress fit great around my waist and would have been perfect except the space in the chest area was too big. it looked odd on me with all the extra fluff in the chest. fabric is nice and flowy. the dress is lined.
1 Sadly, this has to go back. i am 5'5", 128 lbs and this shirt is super short on me. very short. and it's so wide it's almost a trapeze cut. the overall effect is 50s/60s style maternity shirt. which is disappointing because the fabric is beautiful, the detail is nice in person, even the sleeve cuffs are great. i am not very tall and i'm fairly thin on top so i can get away with a lot of styles, loose and tight. the combo of short and trapeze is just unflattering.
4 I tried this dress in my usual size 4. the slip underneath was a big snug but the dress was fine. i sort of looked like a little girl in this dress. it is very pretty but more for the younger girls~not for the over 50 group.
4 I was sad that this was only online because i wanted to try on the xs and small to compare. i usually wear an xs in most antrho clothes, and i decided to get an xs because i was afraid the peplum part would be large. however, when i got it in the mail, the xs is too small! i tried to get it in a size up, but i couldn't find it. it's a cute shirt, but it runs small. even the length of the shirt is shorter than i would have liked. if they had the correct size, i would have gotten it, but this shir
4 I loved this dress the moment i first saw it! i have another dress from this brand that i've had for a couple years and wear it all the time plus i love the tie waist detail. however after trying this dress in both a size medium (my typical size) and a small, i've given up. it does not look good on me and i think thats because i am a 34b, there is room in the chest even in the size small. so would look really good on a curvy girl! i'm 5'5" ordered regular size and it came to just above my knees.
4 This tank is fairly soft and fits true to size. i like that i can pick between a v or round neck, depending on my outfit. it truly offers a profile to layer with anything. the only complaint i have is that the edging wears faster than the rest of the tank. i've trimmed some pilling off of it to keep it looking neat. otherwise, this is one of my favorite tanks, and i have purchase two more so i can always find one when i want it. this tank has some stretch, so i imagine it fits a range of siz
4 The dress is nice, love the embroidery, love the front cinch but why not all the way around? the back is fast flat so cinching makes the sides stick out..got petite and the sizing was nice. i just didn't love the overall look on my body type.
1 I got fooled by this dress's description. it's 100% polyester and not wool as it claims to be! looks cheap.returned it!
4 These shorts are comfortable but so stylish. even though, i love many of retailer shorts, these are one of my favorites.
4 This is a beautiful sweater. the color is not bright red, rather a dark coral. nonetheless it is much better looking in person than in the web photo. i only have one complaint which may be reason enough for me to return an otherwise perfect sweater. i wore this for approximately three hours today and could not believe the pilling under the arms and side of chest area. some pilling is normal and expected on any sweater but if this continues at the rate it appears to be going, i will contact retailer
4 This jumpsuit is so, so cute. i tried it on in an xs in store but needed a petite. i ordered the xsp online, received it, but honestly it's still a little big. the xxsp is sold out, but i love the piece so much i think i'm going to have it taken in. trust me, it's just as cute as it looks, if not cuter!
4 I was hoping not to like this tee so that i can be $48 richer (lol). it's very cute. i would say runs true, but more on the smaller side. i usually wear xs and it's a good cut for me. it's not boxy at all. i love the strap detail on this tee. i hope the quality will hold up. for reference i am 5'3 and 123lbs (2/4).
4 These are nice and light weight and comfortable
1 After reading the previous review, i was pretty confident in ordering this dress. it arrived in the mail today, and i was so disappointed. first of all, it's huge. the medium was way too big on me, and i'm never a small at retailer! (i even considered ordering the large in this - my normal size at retailer.) second, the colors are not as vibrant as in the photo, and the fabric felt cheap. finally, it just looked like i went to hawaii and bought a drab dress there that didn't fit right.
4 Personally i love cloth and stone. . this top however sheer is still a nice top to have in my rotation. it is thin, lightweight, and sheer but with a cami or nude bra can be pulled off nicely.. i did find the top to be tts for me but the sleeves were snug. i purchased this on sale with extra 30 percent off so i was justified in getting it..
4 I loved the jumpsuit the moment i saw it in the catalogue and luckily there was one returned to the store near me! i am 5'10" and 140 pounds. the small fit perfectly, but the zipper on the top section was so difficult to use that i would need help every morning to get dressed. the zipper was missing a couple prongs and i had to make the return.
4 First, this vest is made by elevenses. i love this menswear inspired vest. it's simple and structured, however, it's long on my 5'2 frame. the price is also a little steep, but it will add a nice touch to a simple outfit. i plan on taking this to a tailor to take an inch or two off the bottom.
4 I am keeping this because i got a great deal (30% off sale price), it fits great (i alternate between xs and s, went with s), and overall it has nice quality (thick fabric, secure toggles, etc.), but--what is with the lack of lining? i would hesitate to buy anything from this brand at full price because of that. there are just large seams on the inside, which is tolerable because of the type of fabric, but come on.
4 Loved it on the hanger and when i tried it on. it's a gorgeous shade of blue (denim, not navy) with some light tie-dye streaking along the top and sides which add interest. the "bat wing" feature is a little limiting; i won't be able to reach anything high without the whole top coming up with me. as for the material, it's an interesting blend bc it isn't soft or rough. some may say it's itchy and some may say it's soft, to me it isn't either. it's merely smooth enough. which sounds terrible, "it
4 This dress is beautiful! the concept looked really striking online and it really delivered in person. the material is a good weight for winter but soft and really quite luxurious. the collar is subtle and adds a lot of elegance.there's not a lot of stretch though. i'm 5'5", 130lbs, and usually btw xs, xsp, s, and sp and will probably go with the s on this one. you have to try this on!
4 While i have to agree with some other reviewers that this is not the most flattering coat (as a size 12/14 with hips, it does my hips no favors), but the comfort and warmth make up for it. this coat is so soft, it's like wearing a puffy blanket. unlike typical puffer coats, it does not have any kind of vinyl feel to it- but nor does it have any wind or water resistance at all. with all that said, the comfort and cosy feel won me over. i've received several compliments as well, so maybe it's more
4 I so wanted these to work. i am 5'1" and 120# ordered an xs. they were just way too long. i love the look of a cropped jogger but they looked nothing like the model. i rolled the waistband and it brought the hem up to my foot/ankle but they were still way too long to be flattering. otherwise they were super cute and cozy.
1 The pleats on the bib make this look like something from chloe sevigny's wardrobe on the set of big love. and the shoulders are cut for an offensive lineman.
4 I feel slim and comfortable in these cute trousers.  got compliments at work.   they are definitely more of a work pant, due to the material.  i think i could wear them outside of work (look-wise), but maybe wouldn't feel as comfortable in them after the hours of nine-to-five, due to the material.
4 This is a cute, fun addition to my wardrobe, especially since i am a polka dot fan! it is alittle short for me and i think it runs just a bit small, particularly if you want to wear like the model with longer shirt under it. overall, it was worth the sale price and will look good with casual pants, jeans and with dressier black pants for work.
4 I really like the dress it is cute and comfortable. the only problem i'm having is finding leggings that match the way i want. dress will be cute with leggings and boots or sandals in the spring. it is very casual.
4 I purchased this sweater in grey to take on a fall european trip. it is very pretty without being overly frilly. a marled heather grey color. soft and warm without being too bulky. light enough to wear in the daytime but with enough coverage to transition into a cool evening. casual enough to wear over a tee or blouse with jeans yet sleek enough to pair with a skirt or dress. it is a roomy fit without being sloppy. i like things a bit loose and comfy - not too tight and am happy with the medium
4 Stumbled upon these in a size medium at the store and was initially very disappointed that they were too big. the sales associate found an x-small and suggested that i try them on. i was so pleased that they fit (but am definitely not an x-small at this point in my bottom ... i mean, life). wore these for a 4th of july party and felt elegant and comfortable all at once. they were just dressy enough with a white trapeze tank, long gold necklace, and gold sandals (i can only imagine them with
4 I really liked these jeans. i had to return though. they run small. i normally wear a 27 and could have gone for a 28 in these. maybe it was because i went for the petite. they can run a bit smaller.
4 They fit snug and accentuate all the right curves. they could be shorter. the lace up sides are interesting, but i might sacrifice the lace ups for making them shorter. actually they are cuter on in person than in this photo.
4 This is a really pretty top. the yellow underneath is a very pretty shade and the tank itself is very soft and comfortable and just loose enough to hide any bit of tummy. the armholes are large, however, so they are low and make the front look almost like a halter with the way they come in. i would order down a size as a result. you'll be able to wear most bras with it but be aware that anything that spills out under your arms will be visible.
4 Absolutely love! wear it with suits, jeans...anything. the orange color is super unique and the lace is so pretty and seems like it will hold up over time. so glad i purchased!!!!
1 Granted that i am not as reed thin, or as young, as the model. but i am tall and reasonably slender. i have long hands and small wrists, which would be a factor in the overall effect of this garment. this poncho looked like some sad old stretched out who-knows-what that you'd keep in the car for emergency purposes, in case you needed warmth if the car broke down in a snowstorm -- and i have one of those foldable reflective blankets in the glove box for that purpose. i was looking for a statement
1 Looks great in the picture but when i got this in the mail the fabric was so stiff! shaking it out did nothing-almost like it was dipped in drying glue. i got this for $10 which is so cheap and i still returned it!
