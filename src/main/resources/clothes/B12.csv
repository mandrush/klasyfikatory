2 This is a problem i have had with the pilcro hyphen cargos with the color dye.the dyes in these pants are the same thing. i wore the purple color and washed in cold, gentle, cycle and they were stained/ i will return these -it's too bad because they were pretty comfortable and flattering pants.
1 Really unattractive shirt. nothing good i can say about it. horrible fit. i can't imagine this would look good on anyone.
1 This sweater is the perfect sweater except for one thing.....it sheds everywhere. i can simply pick up the sweater and shake it in one hand and 40 large pieces of lint go everywhere on the ground and on you. if you like dark jeans- don't purchase. before i walked out of the store- the salesperson had to use a delineator on me- it was hysterical. sheds so much
1 This sweater was not as featured in the picture. the front is completely cropped while the back is regular length. the front barely reached the middle of my stomach. also, the color was not as vibrant as shown in the picture. this sweater will be going back.
1 This blouse has too much drapey fabric and it's just not flattering.  in the front part of the blouse the fabric is relatively short, but the sleeves have so much excess fabric it almost looks like a clown suit.  sending back.
2 I was so excited for this dress.. but sadly it did not meet expectations. the gauze fabric already had several snags/pullers in it. the underslip was very short and just cleared my derriere.(i'm 5'7") i normally take a 10/12 and ordered this in a l.. it was somewhat clingy in the hip area but yet bulky on top. also, i like to have the first button open, but you could then see the v neck of the underslip and it looked hokey. it's definitely a thicker material than the previous plaid tunic holding
1 I wanted to love this dress because the fabric is fun, but i could not find a way to make the drawstring waist look like anything but a potato sack.the model has her hands hiding the lack of a waistline
2 This is huge. i understand that's the style, but it looked like i was wearing my husband's size xxl. i tried to imagine a really cold day when all that extra fabric would be nice... but then it started to itch, and itch and itch!
2 I love this dress as far as the fit goes. it makes my curvy figure loook even better with how it's cut. that being said the different patterns over each boob made the dress look crazy. it makes you look quite lopsided in the chest. wasn't just me, but my store people also agreed. had the pattern on the chest been the same it would be great, but even though my boobs are of "mostly" equal size, they looked too crazy. it's quite noticeable on. so sad:(
1 I am petite (5'). even the xsmall petite looked sloppy on me. i also disliked the nude fabric under the lace- it made it look cheap. i wanted this to be the perfect lbd, i  just couldn't make it work on my body.
2 The dress is very pretty, but the sequins are dark blue! i imagined they would be silver/gold, given the photo, but the dress is essentially light pink and blue.
2 This looks cute in the web photo, unfortunately it is absolutely huge in person. i got the small and have to return it because it is not wearable for me.
2 Unique print but not great execution. the pant legs are very tight, i have average sized calves and i sized up one size. the hook closure was oddly tight and difficult to clasp. when i first saw the color it looked like burnt sienna or a dried blood color. too bad this didn't work out.
2 I ordered a regular size s and it was way too boxy for my body type and shorter than the stated length. i don't know if the length stated is from a size m, but the small was definitely shorter (in the front at least).  if you're petite with curves like me, it's not a flattering cut.
2 I really wanted to love this blazer...i've even tried it on several times hoping it would look better the next time around. (spoiler: it didn't :( ). overall, it makes me look pretty frumpy and not put together. i really love saturday/sunday brand and was hoping for a nice comfy blazer to wear to work. will be returning instead.
2 While you can't count on the photo on your monitor to portray the exact color of an item, these photos are way off.  instead of the warm charcoal i see online, the pants are more of a dusty blue.  the material has very little stretch and i couldn't get into the size 24s.  the 25s were tight in the entire leg but huge in the waist.  for reference i usually wear a size 24 in brands like 7 for all mankind and citizens of humanity.
1 There's a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views. it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse. the print is lovely but the fit is very odd. it's pulls at and is very tight through the bust too. i wear medium or large and ordered size large. if you're less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you. but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide. returned.
1 I really wanted to like this dress. the color is perfect, the design and cut are cut (not always the case at retailer). however, the fabric quality was terrible - a shiny acrylic with cheap nylon lace. it looked like something from a discount store and had to go back.
2 I totally agree with the last reviewer. i'm 5'2" 115 pounds with somewhat wide shoulders. the x-small fit my torso but was so tight in my shoulders i couldn't move my arms. the small was better but was too big in the torso. the material itself was really nice. too bad the fit was so awkward and unflattering.
2 I ordered this dress in the blood orange and have a few complaints. while it appears to be made with quality, it runs really large. also, in the picture the fabric appears to have a sheen and be somewhat dressy. the actual fabric is just flat cotton. it's a very casual dress, not as dressy as pictured. it's also quite shapeless on. i'm returning it.
2 Loved the material and the style. unfortunately, my fears came true when i received this swimsuit, and there wasn't enough support despite a review i had read. as a 36d, i thought the halter would be enough support, however, the material is too stretchy to rely on that completely. i am sad i won't be keeping this though. the material is heavenly!!!
2 It is so cute in the picture but wasn't flattering on me. it also felt like i couldn't raise my arms while wearing it. i love retailer and will be a forever fan, but this dress just wasn't for me.
2 The pants are pretty and run true to size, but the fabric is bathing suit like, very thin and sheers in the butt when you squat. i wouldn't recommend for anything but waking.
2 I absolutely fell in love with this dress in the store and immediately scooped it up in black. wore it 3-4 times on hot summer days and it was perfect! very comfortable, easy to throw on and dress up or down. i decided to hand wash instead of dry cleaning (as i usually do) and after hanging dry, it became significantly more translucent than it had been before! i can no longer wear this dress because you can see everything through it. it's as though the fabric completely changed after being wet.
2 This sweater was pretty short. beyond that, when i raised my arms, the thickness of the sweater caused the shoulders to rise up and stay there when i put my arms down.
2 For me, this looked better in the picture. i found the actual item more garish in person, and way too scratchy (on the outside) for my liking. hard pass for this petite.
1 This dress was a disappointment. not black, but brown. and it was very oddly made, with a weird, seam right across the belly. on its way back...
2 Like the other reviewer said this top is extremely wide and boxy. it must be pinned in the picture online. it's very frustrating when they do that. thank goodness i didn't pay for shipping! for reference, i'm 5'2 and 135 pounds and bought the xxs, it's going back for sure. i'm trying to lose baby weight, not trying to look pregnant!
2 Loved this online, but the xs was too big and the material was too bulky.
1 Cute and very soft, but the elastic wasn't sewn in right. i took them out of the wash and the waistband was a twisted mess. disappointing for more expensive loungewear.
2 Cute enough, but i couldn't figure out what to do with the tie that didn't make it look like an extra set of sleeves, oddly placed.
2 I am 5'8", 140lbs, pear-shaped. i ordered the s and it fit perfectly, just skimming the floor. the material is a beautiful gauzy metallic material that is lightweight with a beautiful drape and wonderful sorbet-inspired colors. the waistband is elasticized but not elastic, and there is no unflattering poofing, which can happen with skirts like this. the flaw, however, is in the decision to only half-line this skirt with an off-white jersey material. the half-lining isn't horrible but i found it
2 I ordered the top from a store to have it shipped. it is very pretty but once on, it fit the wrong way. i got a small because i know that this designer tends to run tight across the bust. the shoulder was too rounded for this neck line. sleeves should have been either longer or sleeveless. the empire waist even on a smaller busted woman like myself was cut too high.
1 I ordered the taupe version of this tee, which was a medium brown with black stripes. the fabric felt itchy and rough, and was pretty sheer for not being light colored. i didn't care for the fit, which was extremely boxy and wide; from the picture, i expected an a-line fit, but not a wide drop with webbed underarms. i ordered 2 sizes, and could have worn the smaller if i'd kept this tee. it runs on the larger side. what astounded me most was that both tees i ordered were sewn with completely cro
2 I've been looking for the perfect white eyelet maxi, feels like a perfect summer staple...but sadly this was not it. quality isn't great which is surprise on a $168 price tag. top of dress is lined but cheaply so it's somewhat see through. the dress was returned.
2 This is a beautiful sweater with deep rich colors. i purchased the blue motif. the problem is that the model(s) are small busted, which allows the side panels and front panel to lay nicely and swing in a flattering manner. i am 5'6'', 135 pounds and a 36d. i usually wear a small in antro tops. i purchased this online, and was excited upon it's arrival. when i tried it on, i was horrified. it looked like a babydoll maternity sweater on me. the front did not lay well (flat) at all from the chest d
2 It's a beautiful top but not for bigger busts. ordered an xl and the top part would not button. i recommend for those with smaller busts.
1 I ordered this in both an extra small and a small... i found that there was a very big difference in the two sizes- the extra small was true to size and had a great width, but was shorter in length than i would've liked (if it shrunk at all, it would've been unwearable). the small was quite a jump in size and was a little wider than i liked, but i decided to keep that one. the top was very cute and comfortable when i wore it, however i just washed it once on delicate in cold water and when i
1 Material is strange. triangle top is funky. this is just not awesome in any way.
2 The colors are vivid and perfectly autumnal but the fit is a mess. it was overall too large, the waistline curves up in the front and then falls into small pleats which was maternityish, the waistband was thicker than the dress and sat away from my body and the material was a cheapish poly. had the outer dress been made from the same material as the lining, i would have liked it better. the modesty closure was a plus but the dress was already unraveling when i took it out. #returned
2 I tried a size x small on in the store and i am 5'4" 120 lbs. i had trouble getting my head through the dress, and once i did it felt so tight at the neck, as if it was chocking me. the dress color is very nice but the tight neck and odd arm holes were a no. i would not recommend this dress for those reasons.
1 Loved the look, fit and styling of this turtleneck. but dry clean only, you have to be kidding?
2 Super cute dress online on the model. what you can't tell from the picture is the slip underneath is not true to size of the dress and the outside layer of the dress is more sheer than the picture shows so you can tell the slip underneath is very tight. it might be my body type. otherwise, it's super cute in person and i wish it would've fit better!
2 It's pretty, floaty, feminine; the photos don't do justice to the prettiness. but the photos also don't show an asymmetrical hem. i understood it runs small so i got two sizes, to be safe, and even my larger size was strangely short-waisted, and i'm short-waisted to start with. maybe i could've lived with that, but both the dresses i received have an uneven hem unlike any i've ever worn or seen before. it's not longer on just the sides; the hem is longer in one spot on the front, and one in the
2 I really wanted to like this dress, but where the skirt meets the top of the dress in the back creates sort of a hunchback effect in the back. will be returning.
2 This top completely fell short for me. i was so excited for it to arrive yesterday and upon opening the package i knew immediately that it was not what i was expecting. in the images online there seam up the middle of the shirt isn't even noticeable but in person it is very prominent...and not in a good way. the peplum is a lot fuller then pictured as well. did not work well with my large bust (34d). returned.
2 Loved the brushstroke design and simplicity of black on white; however, the tee was way too big. it looked boxy and sloppy.
1 I was interested in this sweater because i actually thought it was a tunic. the sweater is much shorter than i thought. i wish i could return it. i bought a size large which is my normal size.
2 The fabric is great. the design is fun. i thought the dress would be perfect for work and also wear for a fun night out. the fit was perfect up top but the bottom part was to full and a lot longer then i expected. so i had to return it.
2 Let me start off by saying how pretty this top is, and heavy,.and itchy!  you would have to stand like the model does in the first shot to wear the top (with your arms not touching any part of the top!  the sequins will itch if you put your arms down (underneath the armhole).  another reason i didn't like the top was because the should straps are unadjustable.  i would have to get mine tailored for my 5'2" frame.  i usually wear a medium or 6/8 in tops and ordered this in a medium, it was roomy.
2 This really was nothing special. for $68 there are much cuter tops at retailer. it wasn't particularly flattering as it was very boxy, so it added volume. it was soft and felt like decent quality which was nice. i agree with another reviewer that the ruffles feel too big. overall, this was just a miss for me.
2 Too small... too flare... nice thick fabric. not my favorite pant.
1 This dress was very boxy and unflattering. i really wanted to like it because the blue and white details were so pretty but it had to go back.
1 These are light and airy and pretty. they also tore the third time i wore them and not on a seam - a little above the knee while i was lying in my bed.they also do not slim the figure and the fabric is slightly see-through as it is so thin, therefore if you are looking for serious lounge pants - great - i would not leave the house in them... or turn over in bed in them.when i sit, the slits fall down around my thighs. my son complimented my dress the other day because the slits give way
1 I had hoped this bulky knit would be cuddly and soft, with suri (a type of alpaca) in the title. i don't know if the blend (45% polyamide, 25% royal baby alpaca, 20% fine merino) threw it, but had i felt this in store, i would never have even picked it up. unimpressed.
2 This is cut very strangely, i'm short waisted and this barely covered my belly button. the material is rough and scratchy. did not like at all and will be returning.
1 I bought this shirt in a l, since i didn't want it to be too fitted and was concerned a m would be. it is so boxy! it's like a completely different shirt. i have no idea how it looks good on anyone, unless it is simply widened the larger the size. maybe a m wouldn't be as wide and therefore as boxy, but this shirt is just a bad mess. returning.
1 I love the idea of this top and ordered it in white. it is a great design and proportion is nice with jeans. the front is off white t shirt material with a pocket and the back is a light grey heathered panel. i am returning it as it is very thin and the quality is cheap looking. if the grade of material had been a bit thicker and better made, then it would have been a winner!
2 I love these pants. bought them in both black and burgundy. but the burgundy pair split in the butt before i even made it to work in the morning. they weren't even tight. so disappointing. i will be returning them.
1 Horrible fit not true to size again aline outside of the dress and a very tight camisole underneath
1 I thought it would be heavier than it is. it's thin and more delicate than what i would expect for a winter sweater (it contains wool so not really suitable for spring/summer). it's also shorter than it appears on the model and a little wider/boxier too.
2 Disappointed :-(this top has a boxy shape and looked like a mini moo moo on me. i have a similar shape as the model and it looked nothing like that on me. bummer! i liked the quality and weight (not too heavy nor too light) but shape is unflattering. it's going back.
2 I have purchased many dresses from retailer for weddings and events.  this is the first time i have been disappointed with the quality.  however, the sleeve on this dress ripped after lifting up my toddler son in the middle of a wedding.  the size 4 seemed to fit perfectly, but the fabric had no give.  it was not overly tight in the bust as i am bra size 34aa.  for the price, i expected better.  the color and style of the dress is gorgeous, so perhaps ordering one size up is the answer. . .
1 This top doesn't at all fit like it does on the model. the mid section is very wide and boxy and the material is thick and almost sweatshirt-like. i typically wear size small or 4, but perhaps an xs might've fit or looked better. sadly i must return this shirt.
2 Great hopes but a sorry disappointment. at this price, one should be able to expect better pattern alignment as shown on model. the pattern in the garment i received was poorly matched on either side of the button placket. i am 5'6" and ordered xxs. garment was significantly over-sized. i would have had to order one and probably two sizes smaller to achieve a decent fit. because of the oversizing, the shape is more boxy than it appears in the catalog photo. sadly, this buttondown has to be retur
1 Really well made. beautiful. sadly it is very short. not a tunic at all.
1 I loved the look of this dress online, so i was excited to order it, but when it arrived i found it was not at all how i expected it to be. i thought the material would be more lacy, but it seemed pretty cheap. there was also some boning at the waist which is nice in theory, but it made the material poof out just under the waist, making me look like i had a belly. no matter what i did i could not get it to lay flat. returned to the store and bought the embroidered perennial dress instead, which
1 The small, zipped and laid flat, measures 16" across at the bottom of the armholes, 11" at the waist and 18" from shoulder seam to bottom edge. it's too small for a size 0, and not by just a little! too bad, because it really is very pretty.
2 Per the other reviews i sized up and got the medium. it was still tight around the girls (and i'm not that well endowed), but too big in the armholes. the fabric is a kind of thin tee shirt material. i kept it (because i'm lazy) but not sure how much i'll wear it given the strange fit.
1 So disappointed. i love retailer! this was a huge disappointment. i am 5'3" and 120 pounds. when i put it on, all i could think was that i looked just like a clown due to the big cowl neck and how large and round the dress made me look. if i wasn't so disappointed, i might have laughed. this had to have been a design mistake. i've truly never seen something so unflattering.
2 The pattern is very adorable. unfortunately the design is flawed. sizing is great at the waist and hip, and the length is spot on, but the top is wide. it's strange because i don't think it would fit someone that was bustier than me either.will return. i'm considering buying again on sale and having a tailor correct it.
1 I ordered this skirt because it looked cute and versatile. when it arrived the pleat in front (shown in the center) was far to the right so the overall look was crooked. not sure if it was a quality control issue or if that's the true design but it will have to go back. too bad because i had high hopes!
2 Shorts don't fit me like they did the first time and i've only worn them twice! the material isn't what is use to be. it stretches out to fast. i don't think i will be buying these again. wish i could take them back.
1 Bought this shirt on sale. it was super cute in the dressing room, and for the first time i wore it. washed it per the instructions (wash delicate with cold water, lay flat to dry) and it shrunk so much i don't think i'm going to be able to wear it anymore. it was oversized and loose when i bought it, so it shrunk a lot. there is also a small hole all of the sudden, that i have no idea where it came from (wasn't there when i put it in the washer). very disappointed.
2 Saw this online and went in to try on. fit great and is true to size, but i should have known there would be issues as three out of six on the rack had the sewn in tags were all but hanging by a thread. i bought this for my bachelorette weekend in napa and when i put this on i noticed the straps had a few threads coming out and i thought, better get this to the seamstress as soon as i get home to secure the straps. well, literally five minutes into the car ride to the wineries i noticed the seam
2 The quality and fabric of this dress are lovely, but unfortunately i found it to be very unflattering and shapeless. it fit me like a sack, i ordered the m and i suppose i should've sized down, but even in the s i'm afraid this would be far too large. for reference, i am 5'7 and 135 lbs. i have a curvy build so this shape dress just wasn't right on me. i imagine it will look cute on more of a boyish figure. returned.
1 I loved the design and look to this shirt, but it ran way big for me. i loved the forgiving fit, but it just wasn't flattering at all. i even went down one size and it still was huge. sad to send this one back.
1 The top i received was large, really long in length, pockets in the front along the seam, and lots of volume in the back without any princess seams to give it shape. the id #'s matched, but that's about it. returned!
2 I wanted to love this as i love holding horses but it fits weird, slender in arms but baggy in the torso. i will be returning
2 Very very boxy design/cut. try on first or buy knowing you are 90% likely to return. beautiful skirt but if you don't have the right body type/measurements, will not flatter you at all.
2 I would not recommend these pants if you have a curvy or athletic figure. these pants seem to be cut straight up and down. the fabric is not soft, the color is slightly more muted in person, and they are not as relaxed as they appear to be on the model.
1 I bought this online so didn't realize that the fabric at the bottom is very, very stiff. i was expecting something silky, or at least on the softer and more moveable side. the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt. that being the case, it kind of juts out in weird places. the sweater part is very nice, but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture. the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o
2 I really wanted to like this shirt the quality is amazing and much prettier in person but it is hard to take care of. if you wash it the wrinkles are horrible so it has to be dry clean only. also the back is ridiculously long it looks very odd from the side view.
2 I was very excited about this product. when i saw it the pattern was beautiful in the romantic floral and the bottom band looked like the bathing suit was a little longer so i felt it would be good for a large chest. when i received the package i knew instantly it ran small. i tried it on and it barely covered half of my chest. also the band at the bottom is actually very small and not what i expected. the print is just as lovely in person as it is online. i don't even know if sizing up will mak
2 I really wanted to like this top, just got it in mail today, but unfortunately it did not work well for me because i'm 6 ft tall and the blouse was too short. i like the look and how it feels and i haven't completely decided whether to return it, but here are the issues i have encountered with this top. the blouse is very pretty and has a nice refreshing style with good print and color, very soft too, unusual for rayon of this type, feels more like thin delicate cotton. i got my top in red, size
2 I found this dress to be very short waisted, much closer to an empire waist than shown in the picture. it was also an inch or two longer in the skirt than other maxi dresses i've gotten from retailer. it really could have used those inches above the waist. just a strange fit overall.
2 I was really wanting a nice white summer blouse to pair with patterned skirts. unfortunately, this fell short as it was huge. not only was it big, it flared at the bottom. it would be perfect if i was sporting a baby bump, but not what i am going for right now. if the tank was a bit slimmer i would have kept it as a tunic.i'm sad that i'll have to return it.
2 The suit is lovely, but it is very long in the torso and gaps at the leg. i was told that it runs small and to size up to a 10. i did, but i do not think the smaller one would have done better. the bust is fake and it turns out when untied. worst of all it emphasizes the tummy. all in all not a good look for me. i am not heavy but i do need tummy support. normally i wear an 8 and in garnet hill a 6. sorry but it went back. i really wanted to like it.
1 I've been shopping at retailer since 2007, and floreat used to be my favorite designer, but for the past year or more, floreat mostly misses the mark. this blouse looks nothing like it does on the model. 1. it is long on her, not so in real life. this is probably the worst part about this blouse. if it were not for this, i might try on a size m and give it another chance.2. it runs very large. i usually take a l or xl. i think i would need a m in this, as mentioned above.3. in the picture, t
1 I agree with the other reviewer who said there was too much hardware and such. this really does have a lot going on. i usually wear a 4 in skirts, and based on reviews, went up one size. it still saw way up near my chest - i think even an 8 would be too small! it's sooooo tiny at the waist. probably buy 2 sizes, 2 and 3 sizes up from your own. also, the skirt flares super wide at the sides, it doesn't sit the way in the photo or maybe the model is holding it down with her hand. it's like a skirt
2 I don't normally write reviews, but i purchased this dress in white in 3 different sizes and each dress had the same flaw. the hems were very uneven on all three. this dress was poorly sewn. it's a shame because it looked awesome online. i was very disappointed!!!!!
2 I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable, the fabric contains acrylic and the knitted fairisle part started pilling within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes, it looks horrible, and the fleece part is looking a little grungy as well. so so disappointed. the top is intentionally oversized and comes down to my crotch, i could have easily sized down.
2 This blouse is beautiful and i saw someone wearing it and she looked great. i went and bought this to wear for a holiday party and it is not for people with any sort of chest! it looked ridiculous on me as the pleats started right at the bra line and caused the blouse to tent out in both directions! however - looks super cute on those more on the flat-chested side!
2 The top red is more like orange. was disappointed and returned it
2 I wear med or large in most items. the medium was huge. fit like a moo moo. size down by at least two.
2 I thought this suit would be the perfect solution of stylish but forgiving of my new mom bod. this one didn't work for me. i ordered the medium. the top is very small--i would recommend only for b cup or smaller. the full coverage bottoms did nothing for my shape. it seemed to make me seem rounder and shorter. sending this one back! i did find success same size in a faux wrap style retailer suit.
1 The material is cheap and looks torn. not as nice as the picture.
2 I love love love this print and had to have it when retailer had their 25% off sale. i think regular price is way too much for this dress as the dress isn't even silk or a better material. but once i got this i was so disappointed, i ordered my usual size and it was just a balloon/tent on me. i felt like i was wearing a maternity dress. plus the ruffle at the top which i thought was a sweet feature felt really awkward and like it was grazing my neck and chin in an annoying way. i don't even want t
1 There were no reviews, it's an "online exclusive" and thought it might look good with a nice skirt at an upcoming wedding. the spandex jersey back looks like sweat shirt material. on the white version of this, it is mismatched with an oatmeal color and white that just looks awful. as a busty 36d i was stunned to find myself swimming in a medium. it does not look like the photograph and the sleeve billow out. i feel like this had to have been clipped and tucked in for this photograph. i'm an anth
1 I've purchased pilcro jeans in the past and they've held up great. unfortunately, the material used for this particular jean is a far, far cry from what it used to be. the thighs of these jeans start pilling (yes pilling!) after just a few wears. i've never had jeans do this -- whatever denim blend they are using is a complete disaster.don't buy these -- you will be very disappointed.
2 I think this shirt would be really cute on the right body type, just not mine. i'm 5'5, 125 and a 34ddd a couple weeks post partum. thought this could be a good shirt while i'm nursing bc it's flowy but stylish. unfortunately it did nothing for me when i put it on. the cut drew all attention to my big chest---not in a good way--and distracted from my smaller lower half. made me look much bigger and heavier than i actually am. probably good for small chested girls, very tall girls or curvy on the
1 I stalked this sold out product for weeks hoping my size would become available. when it did, i was very excited, in fact i ordered both a s and xs to be sure one sweater would fit me! unfortunately, neither did and i felt the actual sweater was not as pictured. the sweater has an overall baggy fit and the cutouts don't fall as neatly and as evenly on both shoulders as the picture shows, making the look a bit sloppy in my opinion. it is such a shame as this look is very of the moment and the mod
2 I just received my back-ordered wildberry top in blue. it's not blue but instead a dull, mottled purplish hue. it looks like a well-worn, stretched out tee shirt with a tired ruffle along the bottom. so disappointing. it's going back for sure.
2 I bought this online in the grey and blue and had high hopes. it runs big so size down at least 1-2 sizes. i didn't realize that the sweater looking part on the forearms was part of the coat. that part of the coat is really nice and comfy. unfortunately, the rest of the coat (the wool part) is very itchy. it would've been awesome if it was lined on the inside, but it's not...so i'm taking them back.
1 #childsize. not sure where this went wrong but it's going back immediately. always wear a 0-2 in retailerpologist skirts, this size 0 runs at least two sizes too small. the material is beautiful, but if i got the size i needed i would be entirely swallowed by fabric. so disappointing.
2 Just received these and they fit perfectly, but the panels are different shades of gray. the color is not consistent and it make them look bad. they are perfect otherwise, but sadly they are not wearable. i will be returning
1 These jeans were so cute on- wore them a handful of times and they'd been washed twice. put them on and - rip! ripped right at the crotch in the front so not fixable- and on vacation no less when i had to scramble to find something else to wear. poor quality - disappointing and not what i expected from retailer. :-( they also run large even for a more relaxed fit- sized down for a good fit.
2 It just didn't work for me. i don't know if it is my fair complexion and untanned legs, but this dress was a strike out. the orange floral design and beading is beautiful and the fitting i would say is pretty tts. for reference, i am 5'7" and 145lbs with 36" 30" 40" measurements and i purchased a medium. the chest and arms were not too tight like other reviews stated. the length is about the length in the picture and a lot of fabric to make it very flowy. overall, very good quality and beautiful
2 Very cute dress, but fabric is very flimsy and seams were very puckered which couldn't be pressed out.
1 Unfortunately this top is shirt-length, and i'm only 5'4". needs to be about 6" longer. made of sweatshirt material, which i wouldn't mind if it were longer. also runs very wide- ordered an xs and could have gone smaller.
2 I ordered this because the reviews were outstanding. i am returning it. although the embroidery looks fine on screen, in person it looks cheap and tacky. moreover, the high ruffled neck goes a step too far -- into over-the-top victorian cutesy.overpriced, to boot.obviously, mine is a minority opinion.
1 I wanted to love this blouse so much. but try as i might, it just fit so oddly on me. i'm usually a petite s so i purchased the xs in brown. first. the color was more gray-brown but it was still ok. but second, the fit was off. maybe i just got a bad one, but the center of the blouse was so offset, that the slit in the front laid so far to the left and the v-neck was so low that you could see my bra - there was no adjusting i could do to fix it. the material has a lovely soft silky feel to it an
1 I really wanted to love this top, but there is way too much fabric. it looks nothing like the pictures. it was more like a maternity top vs. a swingy top. i'll be returning this one.
2 I loved this dress when i saw it online, perfect for a summer wedding, but when i tried it on i was very disappointed. the fabric and styling are gorgeous and very high quality but the sheer amount of fabric on this dress is just not as pictured. there is layer after layer of silk and ruffle and while lovely, it made me look very large. i tried tying the belt many ways to no avail. sadly, it will have to go back. it may look good on a very thin frame but didn't complement my average one.
2 This suit did nothing for me. the top has zero support. this would work for a younger woman who does not require any support and is smaller chested. also, the top gapped in the center. it just did not fit right. the top is very thin showing everything. a light padding would make a big difference in this suit. also i could not get a good fit. as i tightened the top, the back would ride up. the bottoms are ok. not renatkable
2 Too much fabric, not a flattering top. for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40.
2 This skirt looks/lays exactly like the photo. i bought a size small and i usually wear a size 4. it was maybe a smidge big, but nothing that affected the look of the skirt. the material reminded me of felt/wool mixed together, almost like sunday school felt cut outs (but stiffer) (not a fan).. i was underwhelmed - it looked plain and simple, and the color washed me out. definitely not worth the price (for me anyways). good luck!
1 Like the previous review said, i was excited to receive this top. i had grand visions of all the ways i could wear it! to my chagrin, when i put it on, it just fell right down and pooled around my waist. i wish there were smaller sizes to order. sadly, this is going back.
2 I bought a petite medium and the length was right, but it fit like a potato sack. it was quite comfortable, and didn't look completely terrible from the front, but from the side, it was terribly unflattering. when i tried it on my boyfriend saw it and said it looked like i was wearing a nightie. i don't do form-fitting clothing, but this was the exact opposite and flared out every which way. it's got to go back.
2 This is the first hd in paris top i haven't loved. high hopes for this top since i love the brand and the color. this was an online only item so i guessed at the size, typically order a 4 petite. ordered the 4 regular since the length was already quite short in the regular length. it was oddly constructed, small in the arms but boxy and oddly bell shaped bottom. the lining was tough to keep straightened while trying to put iton. too bad, but it went back
2 I ordered a medium in this and it definitely fits more like a large. i liked the color & the sleeves, but tying the tie at the neck looks silly on me and leaving it open shows too much cleavage. overall, it is just shapeless and too much fabric on me. i'm sending this one back.
2 This hoodie was too thin. you can see right through it. i returned it.
2 I love jumpsuits for their style and comfort. i loved the look of this blue silky piece, and the review that said it was like lounge wear you could wear out of the house. i agree that it is like lounge wear, but for me, there were a few challenges.first, the fit was small. i am usually anywhere between a 2 and a 6 depending on style, cut and brand. i tried the small in this and it was not a flowy look or feel. it was restrictive in the hip area in a way that would make me not want to wear th
2 I love this shirt, love love love it. i am a curvy girl and it accents all the right features and hides the ones that need to be hidden.but i've owned it for 6 months and there are already 4 holes in the shirt. and not holes in the fabric but holes on the seam lines. the stitching is not sturdy enough for the shirt to not fall apart. the whole point is to be able to wear it. but now i have to bust out my sewing machine to reinforce the seams that split so that i can wear it again. :(
2 This top runs huge. not only in the torso/chest area but the sleeves on this were enormous and the shoulder area was very puffy. i am normally between a m-l but would have to get a small or extra small to make it work.
2 The stone color was nice, but the material is heavy and doesn't breath. if you are partial to more natural fabrics i would go with a different item. upside would be that i imagine this shirt will last.
2 This is the 2nd time i've purchased a dolan top and returned it b/c it was dry clean only. both tops were what i consider to be casual tops to be worn with a pair of jeans, running errands, etc. i do not dry clean this kind of casual shirt. it is made out of rayon, and that's the problem i think.i purchased this in the wine color and it is a lovely color, hangs nicely, doesn't cling. the sleeves are a bit long but i could live with that -- i just pushed them up. as a turtleneck, it was a bit l
2 The dress is extremely high quality! i purchased the dress in black. the white collared shirt that the model is wearing under the dress is not part of the dress. the dress overall is like a balloon. unless you're extremely tall and skinny this dress makes you look bigger! i ordered the small petite and am 125 lbs and 5'4. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it's going back:( the petite hits 3 inches above the knee for reference.
1 This is not a kimono. it's a cocoon. there's a huge difference.it's also not made very well.
1 From the photos, i thought the design was embroidered. in reality, it is stamped on. there is a tiny bit of embroidery and a few sequins, but overall, the design is just printed on the fabric. i didn't feel it looked good, in fact it looked kind of cheap to me, so i returned it. the overall style of the jacket was great and it would have looked equally good for work or casual. i was disappointed it didn't work out.
2 I've been wearing this very comfortable and cute coat for 2 weeks. it is already tearing at the seams somehow. the quality of this is very poor.
1 Didn't like the dress. look pregnant in it. this dress is going back.
2 I wanted to love this shirt. the fit was a little off and i wish it had come in a little at the waist to be more figure flattering before it flared out. the fabric is nice but wrinkles easily and in the white is see through.. sadly i will be returning.
1 I thought from the picture this would be a light floaty top. when it arrived, the fabric was a heavy knit and the neckline sagged very low. on me (granted i'm a pear) the bottom layer hugged my tummy and rear in a very unflattering way. the only thing i liked was the color. back it went.
2 I thought this top would be a little more form fitting than it is. there is so much extra fabric near the bottom it is almost like a swing style top. the fabric will most definitely snag, as it is not a linen or cotton top material but rather a silky type and also very thin - not very good quality. i got the smallest size possible and it was absolutely huge, everywhere but the neck.
2 This blouse is quite stiff. i wouldn't mind the boxiness if this blouse weren't so long. even if you size down, because of the eyelet and the cute hem, it would be difficult to shorten this blouse to fit.
2 I initially liked the feel and quality of the top but once it was on it was much shorter and looser than the picture of the model. it flowed out from my chest with one central pleat in the front and my husband said it made me look pregnant. then came the tedious task of taking it off with such a snug fit in the shoulders. i'm regularly a size 2/xs, 32d and 120 lbs and both size 2 and 4 did not work for me.
2 I loved this dress when i saw it in the store. the colors, weight, fabric. love. love. love. unfortunately i have to agree with other reviewers, the pockets and the positing of the draw string made my hips look unflatteringly large. i tried on a size 0 petite, which is my usual size. all flowed nicely except for when you get to the pockets. truly disappointed as it was beautiful in every other way. but in the end, i had to pass.
1 I'm 5'7", 130 lbs. i ordered a medium-regular. the dress fell three inches above my knees. this model is taller than i am, and it falls to her knees....doesn't make sense. i think retailer sends petites in place of regular.
2 For reference i am 5'5' 138 lbs with an hourglass figure and my usual small fit perfectly. the problems: 1. this skirt is not black but a charcoal gray/purple. 2. the sipper is reinforces with a stiff boarder on the inside so no matter where i put the waist it sticks straight out making me look like i have a tail under my skirt. in other words, i had a very pointy butt. also the slit or tulip part of the skirt goes all the way up to the waist, it needed to be tacked to the other part of the skir
1 I really liked the design. ordered a medium which was huge. also thought i would not be able to tolerate it because of the material -- a bit itchy. returned it.
1 I'm a big retailer buyer- and usually love the dresses, especially the petite xs maxis. this was the worst retailer purchase i have ever made. it was humongous and gave me no shape. even if i purchased an xxsp it probably would be the same. i'm small but i mean come on- this would only fit a giantess-- which also makes no sense because it's the petite size. do not buy. i'm very upset i have to pay the $5.95 return fee since i ordered this.
2 This is another item i've been stalking that i thought miraculously made it to sale with my size still available. i ordered online but when it arrived i have to be honest i didn't even try it on because i knew it would be going back. the beautiful print online looks really cheap irl on the flimsy fabric. the beaded detail on neck is basically a low grade sequin trim. so much potential just executed poorly.
2 This is huge. i thought it would be oversize but with a bit of shape. there is no shape to this and is a lot of material. i ordered an xs and typically wear an xs or s in blouses, sometimes medium in sweaters.it seamed like 2 sizes too big. the material is very soft and the collar is nice. there is a ribbon tie at the waist. the tie is wimpy and could be nicer. when tied, there is so much fabric the is gathers and looks like i have no waist.
2 Sometimes i order things online that i can hardly wait to arrive, and then once they do, i wonder if i made a mistake when ordering it. this is one of those times, and it was not my mistake. the shirt i received is not like this one. it is an xs, but it is quite large falling inches below where this one hits on the model. everyone i have shown the shirt to says that it is a denim blue color, not grey at all. it is a pretty color, but not what i thought i was ordering. i hate it when this happens
2 1. i'm 5'6" tall with a short waist and long legs, and this skirt came all the way down to my ankles. i would have kept it if it had stopped mid-calf like in the photo.2. i'm 38-32-40 and the size 12 fit me perfectly in the waist hip area, so i would say it runs true to size.3. the buttons lay nice and flat over the tummy, so that's a plus. at least you don't have to undo them to go to the bathroom.
1 Sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is. i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life. this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style. another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump . i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was $5.00!!!
2 I ordered this since it looked so cute on the model . when i it arrived, i was excited to try it on, but when i did...blah. the color is murky and the top runs large, not to mention that the material is too heavy for a short sleeved top (plus it's lined). i really wanted to like it and debated wetting it and then putting it in the dryer to shrink it a bit. in the end, i decided that it wasn't worth it. too bad, as the concept was a good one. it just failed in the execution.
2 This is a very slimming, well-made, nice fitting top-i just disliked the colors. they did not look good on me. otherwise this is a very nice piece!
2 So sad becuase i like the design. i would not recomend the lack to anyone that does not live and work and shop in a completely immaculate environment. i wore this to work the day after purchasing and within three hours i honestly looked like i had slept in this sweater for three monthe straight. i had to take the sweater off and work in a t-shirt. the marigold color may be better than the black abut showing lint but something intrinsic to the fabric really attracts lint like nothing i have eve
1 The fabric wrinkles so easily and any slight moisture or liquid immediately turns into a dark spot on the blue grey...condensation drips from a glass, gel deodorant, etc. i tried the cream but it's very sheer. i had to return this dress-- not practical!
1 I loved this skirt when i tried it on. the material is soft with a bit of stretch. i'd say this runs a little large. for reference, i'm usually a size 2/4 in retailer and the 2 was still a little large towards the end of the day as it stretched out. however, my disappointment was with the buttons.i wore it for a day when all of a sudden the top button popped off. fine, that button is the most used. i sewed it back on myself and even reinforced the top three buttons that i use to take on and of
2 Disappointed, the cut of the layer makes anyone wearing it look pregnant. even the model in the picture the way that layer hangs.
2 This sweater is adorable and comfortable, but the poms are barely secured so they just pop off whenever they rub up against anything. i cannot even imagine trying to wash it. unfortunately, i will reluctantly be returning it because the construction is very poor.
1 The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality, and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit, immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.
1 This shirt fits very closely to the body. it has a very strange fit in the shoulder, though. the arms themselves are really long, far past my hands, yet it's very tight in the shoulder and under arm area. for reference, i am 5'10", 130 pounds and ordered a small, which is what i usually need.
2 I was excited to see this top, ordered it and was disappointed. it was too tight across the chest and had too much fabric around the bottom. i tried this on 3 times hoping for i had been wrong in previous assessments- no luck.
2 Huge bummer. this top is definitely a crop/midi-top. plus, it's cream, not white like shown in the photos. i'm returning it today.
1 I generally don't write bad reviews, but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost. the design and colors are great, but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturer's tag is at the back of the neck. the material is very thin, so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment. i shop at retailer all the time, and this is not a $98 item of clothing.
2 Like previous reviewers have said, these run a bit small and i'm surprised no one's mentioned that these are very high rise. for reference, i'm 5'7", 130 lbs, 34-27-37, and am an retailer size 4 in tops and pants. i really wanted to love these pants, but even after ordering a size up and trying on a 6, i was still not in love. and the other reviewers are right ? the back zipper is kinda hard to zip up. the top of these pants are exactly the same as the essential flares, so if you're thinking of ge
1 This was a disappointment because beautiful fabrics with interesting design are a rarity--and especially at this length! unfortunately, this is a mess in terms of proportions. if a size 2 can barely get it off, then there is a design flaw. sadly, the fit was so strange that it did not seem that simply sizing up would correct the flaws.
1 Extremely cute sweater, but after having worn it twice it's already pilling up. i'd expect more for a $100 sweater.
1 I ordered this skirt in a size small and when i received it, not only was it too long, but there was also a hole in it. so i returned it. when a small petite became available, i ordered it thinking it would fit better. i just received it and there is a hole in this skirt as well. both skirts also looked as if they had been worn; there was fuzz and lint all over the skirts. i like the skirt but i either have extremely bad luck or it's really bad quality.
1 If you have any curves, avoid! it is not flattering.the striped side panels look odd with the flow of the dress.
2 Bought this based off the reviews here but this was a miss for me. the colors weren't as vibrant as pictured and the waist in this dress is huge. not flattering and it went back. i buy an retailer dress every week so i just exchanged this one for another one i loved. not hard to do at all
2 The dress was just too ill fitting and bulky and large. it was more matronly looking then anything and did not fit well. if you are going to try it, probably size down 2 sizes. for reference, i'm 5'4" and 124 lbs. i bought my normal size 4 and it was very large. i would not recommend as it's just not flattering. i love one shoulder dresses and tops so was very disappointed as i'm an retailer devotee....
2 The neck is so big on this sweater, i couldn't make it lay right. the shape of the sweater is odd. it is really wide on the upper torso, but tapers near your waist. it did not look as depicted on the model. the sweater is a lovely color, i liked the two-tone, but overall the fit was too weird for me. material is soft and it felt really nice on, but just too oddly shaped and a crazy big neck.
2 The color is a nice cool red and the material is very soft. but the dress left me feeling shapeless and the bell sleeve overtook it. i wanted to love it, but it just wasn't working for me. i'm 5'8" and purchased a s. it fits true to size, however it was loose around the waist and just wasn't complimentary on me. this will have to go back.
2 As other reviews have mentioned, this top has serious craftsman ship flaws. strings hanging off embellishments on sleeves and they begin unravelling as you try the top on. i wanted to love but sadly, returned asap.
2 I love this brand and the material of these shirts and have a ton similar and thought this was adorable with the sweet detail but it is super short and boxy and i felt uncomfortable with the length on me and it also made it so it wasn't so flattering on. such a bummer cuz its a sweet spin on a plain basic tee!
1 I purchased this jacket in my local store. size 10 and runs really small . i love the color combination and design but the fabric in my opinion is poor quality. i have seen a lot of retailer use this poly spun knit in so much of their items and the jacket after bringing it home and looking in the light was already showing pilling. looks like it is worn in an bad way. returned the next day. this was a big disappointment and every time i see this fabric being used in retailer clothes it makes me mad.
2 ....that's what i look like wearing this dress. a sad, sad, sack. the fabric is less than ideal, and there is no shape to speak of. i love that it has pockets but that's about it. there was just way too much fabric for a petite person. this dress has got to be good on someone, sadly that person was not me.
2 I ordered this shirt online and didn't even try it on... it is super see through and i would need to wear a tank underneath and i don't want to have that extra layer in the summer.it is cute though!
2 Quality piece except the fit is way off. i have a 32 c bust and long narrow torso, larger on the bottom. i ordered the small. i frequently wear a small/extra small on top and i was busting out of this in the chest area. however, the fit then flares way out from the torso and it just looked dumpy and overpowered my 6 foot frame. i marked it as running small, which it does on top, but then it runs very large on bottom. wanted it to work, but didn't.
1 An awful dress! retailer why didn't you post my last review. i would not even give it a quarter of a star.
1 I purchased this swimsuit in the mint. gorgeous color combination. i'm 5'5" and weigh 117 lbs. i purchased a small. the fit is true to size. i love the front design; however, my husband promptly brought the back of the swimsuit to my attention. the chevron was off center. the design should have been centered with my back; however, it was on the right side of my back. i immediately called retailer assuming the product was defective. the item was sold out on line; however, a supervisor was able to l
2 I know we've gotten to the point that polyester can be acceptable, but sometimes it's still that horrible texture, unbreathable mess. unfortunately, that's what this top is made out of. so it runs big, its billowy, and cute, but i couldn't get it off quick enough because of the feel of the fabric.
2 I agree with the other reviewer. the colors were fabulous, but it was boxy and fit me like a sack. the slits on the side really detracted from the cute fabric and the hood drooped way in the back due to being able to pull away from the slits. it was really a cute idea and i'm sad it didn't work. i started not to order it based on the first review but i wanted to give it a chance,--i should have listened !
2 This top is has an awkward neckline, doesn't lay like the photo (as mentioned by another reviewer.) see threw, and of poor quality. the fit is very baggy and unflattering. and material is very thin. it also runs very large!! the color is pretty, but that is it :(
1 Love the design of the fabric. i actually bought these in both colors. i gave only 1 star due stitching on the fabric, it's very scratchy.
2 I bought this top in the store, which was good because i ended up wearing a size smaller than i usually do. i loved the flowy fit of it. the washing instructions say machine wash cold, tumble dry low. i washed it on cold and hung it to dry. it shrank to the point of being unwearable (the dreaded button gap!) and lost its softness. i hope the store lets me return it.
1 Quality was not what you expect from retailer, especially for the price. top is lined but skirt is not. material is tissue paper thin and see thru. there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat, it keeps popping up. however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives. was returned.
2 The shirt does have a weird yellow tinge as other reviewers have described. i could get over that if the shirt was a flattering fit which it was not. not worth the money so i returned it.
2 I ordered this in a small petite and medium petite , and i am a huge fan of a*k. i put tried on the sp. while it fit, it was very long, even for a petite. what i hated about it was that the piping on the top made me look very wide. even a long necklace wouldn't help deter the look. on a positive side, the blue was a very nice, cool color. i am usually a small to medium in a*k (6-8 in tops) and the small fit well in the arms/bodice, just too much fabric for me. returning!
1 Retailer consistently provides unique, sophisticated and quality made clothing. with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies, i shop with them exclusively. i suppose that i can't expect 100% perfection from retailer-but 99% of the time-that's what i get. this is that 1%...this sweater is truly awful! i cannot (or find it very difficult at least) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that, had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front
2 I have wanted this dress since i first tried it on in april. finally got it as a birthday gift and after looking at it closely there was makeup on the collar. i checked the instructions and it says "cold water wash". so i washed only the collar part by hand and every part that got water on it bled!!! looks like the popsicles are melting! i'm so sad because this dress is adorable! i'm buying another in hopes retailer will make this right by taking back the first one. should be dry clean only!
1 Do not buy this dress for full price. the design looks great but after receiving the dress, the material is made of extremely cheap slinky-ish polyester that you would find at a f21 store. the stitching is horrific and created an uneven "hump" on the back seam. just absolutely poor poor quality.
2 I saw this sweater online and have been looking for a unique sleevless sweater for some time now. its a very beautiful sweater so i ordered it right away when i saw this design. i recieved the sweater in the mail and really wanted to love it but it just wasn't for me. its very well made and thick which i liked but i usually fit in small sized tops for retailer but they didn't have a small left in the sizes, i ordered a medium and it still ran small, i was very surprised. its was also disappointing
2 I ordered the blue version of this dress thinking the accent stripes were black. they were not ! they were wine colored. i liked the color, but not in combination with the other colors in the dress. black would have been a better look. i had to take it back. sad...
2 Guess i should've looked at the pictures more closely. i ordered the white version and in the pictures you can't see that the sleeves are split - and it barely shows in the picture for the blue version. it also would've helped if the detail of the sleeves were noted in the item description. anyway, i will be returning this top because i don't like the way the sleeves look each time i bend my arms. looks a bit pirate-like to me.
2 These are a beautiful color, but run large. i ordered my usual size and they are falling off of me. they are very low rise so i don't think i'll be trying the smaller size, can't even imagine them being lower. also, they are cropped, that's hard to tell in the picture.
2 Usually wear s and xs, tried this in s at store but the sides were still lumpy after zipping the size zipper up. if i tried xs it would have looked better but may be bit too tight. the sides of the arm holes were also cut very low. it also has a dusty grey sheen to it that makes it look like old velvet in a bad way. two layers, green on outside, and a polyester beige layer underneath.but definitely a showpiece that can be paired with a short jacket.
2 This top is well made and would be cute but huge. this top has no shape and is way big. back this goes.j
2 I really wanted to love this dress, but it just didn't fit in anyway. i ordered an xs petite, and it was very large. the lacing in the back is completely useless, and that's what i liked about the dress. i was thinking it would be unlaced more at the top (because of chest) and then lace more tightly near the waist. it was completely closed off and the dress was still very loose and unflattering. beautiful fabric, great color combo, bad fit.
2 I purchased this top in the black and tan color, loved the fit, style and fabric. however, it is a loose weave and after just one wearing a hole opened up on the front, which could not be repaired. it was covered by the cowl neck collar but as the day wore on the hole got bagger and it can no longer be hidden. i was very disappointed in the quality of this top- i purchased it at full price and was only able to wear it once. i just didn't have the time to return it to the store.
1 Beautiful fabric with soft drape. unfortunately the "captain kangaroo" pockets are awful. unless you have a straight up and down shape with no hips this is very unflattering. the pockets look like saddle bags and add a huge amount of fabric where most people don't want added bulk. very disappointing. returned.
1 This is a very awkward and unflattering shirt. i am very petite--90 pounds and 5'2". the arms fit--length and width, but nothing else about this fit. the scoop was so low and wide that i would require a shirt underneath. it fell exactly like a tent and made a bell shape around my thighs. yikes! it looks cute on the model, but not on me. the material is also very thin and felt sort of like it should be a pajama top.
2 Beautiful dress, but has an unflattering fit. i purchased an xs and it's past my knees and the bottom of the dress is so heavy! would be a perfect maternity dress though!
1 This blazer looks great on the model and i have a long torso so i thought it would be perfect. when i got it it looked like a big box and didn't fit anywhere. the shoulder pads were giant and the bottom of the coat was huge. i got a small based on other reviews, but it was way too big. sadly, i had to return it.
2 Like another reviewer mentioned, this shirt is way too short. i'm only 5'2" (xs) and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model. also, the quality isn't great as it's very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front. it's a shame b/c the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique. sadly, it's going back!
2 I liked the design and i didn't mind that is see through, but i couldn't put it on ! not size 8 what is my usual size , not size 10 or 12, even 14! my shoulders wouldn't go through the middle part and it is not stretchy , so disappointed. i really wanted to like it.
2 This top is too short, so much so that tucking it in would be difficult. the designs are lovely, but the short length is putting this top back on the rack.
2 Unfortunately the dress is pulling apart after the first wash ( gentle hand wash cycle). also, there are no bra-straps holders, and my bra straps did show up a lot...
1 I tried this blouse on and loved the style, comfort and color of the peach so much that i was preparing to buy it. when i pulled the sleeve the fabric came away from the cuff. i tested another spot pulling only gently and the same thing happened. too bad since the color would have been a great addition for me. but--i also tried the blue and it gets 4 stars, as the fabric is much better. it too is adorable, soft and did not tear on gentle testing. the two blouse colors are made from different
2 It was very pretty,but it ran very big , sadly i had to return it.
1 The jeans look so different online! the pair i got did not have the stone washed look and was completely different cut. the rise is not as stated and is actually 10.5 inches! also, i'm a true 25 and the waist is like a 27, but the legs are super skinny. i'm so disappointed and i'm not even sure if is worth swapping out for a smaller size. these look more like men's cut jeans.
2 I built a new wardrobe around the three lovely velvet blazers: moss, copper and burgundy. they are soft, well-fitting, pretty linings and very satisfactory. this new version is stiff material, and ill-fitting. not coming in petite is a problem and it may fit others better, but it is too full across the front. with the stiff materials, this is a bad fit. disappointing and going back.
1 This is the most unflattering peplum top i have ever tried on. fit perfectly as a size 6 should in the arms, shoulder, chest... then the waist was huge! just hung off of me like a flour sack. it was wider than the chest measurements, which made me appear frumpy instead of tailored and classic. combine that with the high-low hemline and it looked like a project runway reject. sent back immediately, do not buy this if you have (or want to appear to have) an hourglass figure, it will do nothing for
2 Purchased this in two colors online. purchased in an xs - i am usually a s or xs. the fit was really large in the xs and the seam on the front of the top was in the wrong place and was really unflattering. returning both.
2 I tried this blouse on in the store. i'm generally an 8 or 10 in this brand. i got down to a size 4 and gave up. this blouse is huge all the way around. the detail on the blouse is pretty, but the tent like cut made it impossible for me to buy it. i know retailers blouses can be swingy and flows but this went way beyond. perhaps on a tall person the swing would work but on a short person like myself...i looked ridiculous.
2 Bummer, i fell in absolute love with these gems until i realized how weak the stretch is by the end of the day. i purchased them on the 13th of feb and can't bare to wear them anymore.
1 When i tried it on, it was a bit shapeless, but it was on a promo so i decided to get it. i kind off like shapeless. i've worn it three times and washed it gently in the machine as recommended (in a lingerie bag, always) and air dried it. it now has a huge rip on the sleeve seam, and i cannot see how this happened. the inner lining is soft and substantial  but the outer gauze layer is thin.
2 Got this in wine, very pretty and soft. but so sheer, even with the dark color one would have to wear a cami. returning for this reason. having to wear a cami wrecks the otw ultra-comfort.
2 The model looks awesome in this cute top, but on me it looked boxy but was too tight around the chest and was too short (for reference, i'm 5'7," 140 lbs., and 34c). the front is non-stretchy eyelet lace cotton fabric, yet the back is stretchy. in theory, it's pretty, but in reality it doesn't work - at least for me. i think it might work for someone petite with a smaller chest.
2 I really loved this dress in the store when i tried it on the color and fabric were perfect for summer but once i got this home i noticed the placket wouldn't lay flat across the bust like shown in pictures. when i went up a size it was too large under the arms so this one will sadly have to go back to the store.
2 Loved it online for its modern cut and print. however, when i received the item i was disappointed. i ordered my usual size 4 and i was swimming in it. i like oversized things and understand that this dress is made that way; however, this was not flattering. i would say i would have needed to size down to a 0 and perhaps it would work but i didn't want to take another chance. the material seemed almost crepey, which i wasn't neccissarily expecting either. bummer that it didn't work out.
2 Nice design but very wrinkly fabric that doesn't fall well. also, as has happened to me before, retailer sent me a dress clearly worn/used and returned by someone else with hair all over it. you would think they would at least look at returned dresses to make sure that the returned clothes were free of stains and hair before they send them out.
2 This dress had beautiful details, and the material was better than i expected; however, it was huge! it completed swallowed me. i am 5'1 about 106 pounds with quite a bit of muscle. i ordered a 00p and it still looked like a sack.
2 This sweater has the weirdest stitching, although the buttons on the sleeves are a nice touch and the hunter green color is to die...poor fit means poor sweater :)
2 I have to return this top. the armholes are huge. the material is on the thin side and not what i expected. i can't size down. i got an xxs. maybe if i had been able to order a petite, it would have fit better. i ordered the red and i liked the color.
1 I was really excited to get this dress, i initially ordered a small (i am a size 4) but when i tried it on, it was really tight. the bodice at the top fit strangely-i had to shorten the straps quite a bit, and the dress just looked off. i love retailer and get all of my dresses from there, and the look of the dress on line was beautiful, but just didn't fit right. i did love the lace look, and would love seeing more dresses with this design.
2 This blouse was so cute, i really wanted to love it. as others mentioned, there is something wrong with the fit. i'm not a large person, but the top was tight even though i ordered a medium and a small.
2 I wanted to love these jeans, but as a woman who is almost 45 there was way too much stretch in them. i am always a size 26 and i couldn't wear these, they were way too tight! they went back the next day. i will say, it could be my body type, i"m a runner so my legs are muscular. if you have very thin legs, these could be great and work for you. i loved the color, dark blue.
2 I wanted to love this, but instead of being a flowy kimono top as pictured- it was a thick blazer type garment. not at all what is pictured here unfortunately. also it was much shorter than pictured and i am only 5'4''. love most retailer styles, but this one was a miss and a return.
1 Beautiful jacket and i got lots of compliments. true to size. it's not thick but it's very warm.
1 I bought these and returned them almost immediately. the material looks nice, but itchy and heavy. the fit is too small and just uncomfortable to wear.
2 The fabric and color are absolutely beautiful. the shape of the dress is strange - fitted and tight through the waist, and enormous everywhere else. it was not flattering.
2 This might look good on you if you are very tall and slim. i am a curvy medium and this was not at all flattering, it is a straight cut and hugs in the wrong places. the color is not true: it is black stripes on gray (not cream). i thought the stripes might flatter my shape, but alas, i did not look good in this.the material is very nice, soft and stretchy.
1 I was surprised at the positive reviews for this product. its terrible! it cuts you in a weird place to make you look wide. the skirt is also not like the picture. its darker and heavier. the material isnt great. i had to return.
1 Do not waste your money on this.at first, i bought pilcro hyphen chinos short and i loved it. so i bought this pants in store too. i laundry them yesterday and they both came out colorless. i was so shock. fyi, i did not use bleach or chrolox, i mean i don''t use them.i will return them both.still mad. this is bad quality enough worth it.
2 The style was really cute but the fit was huge. i ordered an xs. i don't think going to the xxs would have helped. i ended up returning it.
2 Way too big and had a granny like styling. was very excited but ultimately took it back.
2 These are very flattering thick leggings that would keep you warm in the fall and winter, but when i pulled them up i got a big hole in the seam at the waistband at my first trip to the bathroom! obviously you might expect a rip if they were too tight, but these fit perfectly (even on the looser side) and ripped effortlessly. pretty embarrassing given the price! bringing these back! for reference ( if you decide to try your luck), i am 5'7", 128# and my normal size s was perfect.
1 My husband never has anything negative to say about my clothes until i wore these pants! they are not flattering and kept stretching out until i could pull them off without unzipping them! baggy in the behind and sloppy looking. they are going back asap!
2 There were just too many pleats to this thing. it was not flattering. it looks fantastic on this model but not on me. oh well.
1 Ordered a l and xl, the sleeves were so tight on both sizes but the rest of the shirt was wide and loose. the tight sleeves were not proportional with the rest of the shirt. both sizes had to be returned.
2 I loved the design of this blouse and ordered it the first day it was available. unfortunately, i was disappointed on arrival. besides being more muted color-wise, the sizing is way off. i ordered the xxsp and it was huge on me. on the model, it looks like it skims the body, when in reality, it falls like a tent. i tried tucking it into a skirt, but there was just too much fabric.though the neck worked for me, i can see how it might be too small for some people as it is very narrow. also, it
2 Good reason to read reviews. i concur with others in that it fins large and looks boxy. heavy fabric makes matters worse.
1 I bought this dress because i saw it in stores when it first came to retailer. it was stunning. the colors were vivid and the beading was intricate. i regretted not purchasing it immediately. fast forward to today... the dress i received was not the one that was originally in stores. the fabric was different, there was hardly any beading, and the colors were washed out and dull. i read previous reviews saying that the dress was more like the studio pictures than the original promo. but t
1 I ordered this tee despite the price. the fabric is very thin and the quality was poor. nice concept for a tee, but failed in quality and value. it was returned.
1 I sized down as other reviewers suggested (usually an 8, went down to 6) and the dress fit fine--but it was not attractive. the cut was like a tent with an empire waist. really just not attractive. maybe it has to do with my body type, but compared to the model, this dress was so unflattering in-person. returned.
2 I purchased this top in blue and liked it so i ordered the red color. i hated the way the second one fit. i'm concerned the blue will not wear well after seeing the way the second one looked!
2 I&#39;m taller (5&#39;8), so it&#39;s not uncommon for things to be too short on me, but this was really short for the style.  it was very wide and loose all over in my usual size - both up top and in the wavy part below.  the style really just did not work with the length.  it looked very odd.
2 Color is not like photo and fit doesn't work if you're busty
2 These would have been the perfect black pants! great cut, love the wide band in the front, true to size, quality construction. but a zipper in the back?!!! i had to ask my husband to help me zip them up. perhaps they would be easier to put on if my bum were a little smaller, but the pants fit perfectly - they were just too hard to put on. sending them back, since i don't have an assistant to zip them up whenever i need.
2 I have been struggling to find a nice flowy summer dress that isn't too short. i am petite but do not like to wear my dresses too far above the knee, so i ordered this in the 00 regular. this dress was not what i expected. it is not flowy, but rather a heavy and stiff fabric. it is also way too wide. it looks like it can't decide whether to be a box or a bag. it is also shorter than advertised. last thing to disappoint was the color - darker and more muted than the photo on the website. i can't
1 Although i love retailer, this product isn't the quality or presentation i expect from them. the dress arrived stuffed into a small plastic bag and was a crumpled mess. the fabric wasn't soft and fluid as i expected, but rather was stiff and a little scratchy. i purchased the ecru version, which was also slightly darker than the photo showed. i returned the dress and will keep looking.
1 This dress looked adorable online, but unfortunately, it's not flattering at all, and it's completely see-through. completely. the material is so thin that i can't imagine it would hold up very well over time. this one is definitely going back.
2 I love everything from retailer but this top did not fit all that flattering. the neck line fits a little weird. too bad. color was nice though. i returned the top.
2 I have been dying to try a mara hoffman bathing suit, so i went for this one. unfortunately, the design of the bathing suit is not like what they sent me. the middle where the tops meets the bottom, is squared off, not like that v that it looks like in this photo. it also makes for major side boob/sagging on each side. i was very disappointed.
2 I love the design, that's why i'm going back for a smaller size. i bought a medium and that size was made for someone 50 lbs heavier than i. usually i'm good at choosing my size online, but not today. if you are curvy and round like me still go for a smaller size because this dress has a lot if room. also i wish more clothes would come into the stores to try on, please!
2 Runs small. i'm usually a size sm for retailer clothing (for reference, i'm 5'4, 129lbs, 36b). the tie around the waist of this dress is not a functional tie that you can relax a bit to give yourself more room around the waist. i could not fasten the buttons to close the dress on the size 8. the size 10 fit enough to fasten the buttons but there was a lot of extra fabric and the arm holes were very large. pretty, vibrant colors but size up and be warned of the large armholes.
2 Loved these in store when i tried them on but was in between sizes so i ordered them in the larger size. boy do i regret that! these stretch out so much i have to wear a belt with them and it gives me this saggy bunchy front when i sit...not attractive. wish i could return them, but i took the tag off and wore them not knowing this before hand!! if in between sizes definitely size down.
2 I just got this and couldn't wait to wear it to work today. it is such a pretty designed top. unfortunately, it is falling apart as i write this review. one sleeve is unraveling. there are strings hanging off all over the lacy arms. am so disappointed in the quality. i'll be sending it back when i get home.
2 This has such awful proportions. i'm 5'0 and 100 lbs, ordered xxs petite (in the neutral color). the seam at the bust literally hits in the middle of my bust!! it looks very unflattering, and it's very pronounced. i'm only 5'0 and already the seam hits at such a high point on me. below the seam the sweater is all scrunched up where it's sewed, and it balloons outward and is very square from there down. very shapeless sweater and not flattering at all unless you have your arms by your sides to hi
1 I saw this at the store today. very excited about it but i had no idea how to get it on! there is a side zipper so i attempted to step into the jumper through the collar but could never get my arms through! from what i could see on my body, it would have been too short in the crotch. i decided not to fight with it to put on entirely. i gave up. cute shade of green though.
1 No. this is one of the most unflattering things i've ever put on my body. i'm a very well-proportioned hourglass - i tend to wear a small despite a booty and 36d chest - this made me look huge. don't do it.
1 Very poorly made- wide and short, very unflattering. the material is advertised as cotton, but it felt very synthetic.
2 Given that i am petite with thighs (take a size 6p or 28p) these were not for me! the run small, are really tight from the thigh up, run longer that a petite should and are fairly thin. on top of that the zipper and hook in the back are really inconvenient. i was looking for something i could wear to work, and these were not the right style for that. plus they seemed cheaply made, like they wouldn't stand the test of time. i imagine if you are tall and skinny like the model, they would look good
1 This dress is thin and completely see through. it is definitely not worth the price tag. would be really cute in a thicker material.
1 I bought a pair of these a month ago and first time i washed them they came out with light spots all down the leg. i figured i did something wrong so i bought another pair in the same color and one in sage. just washed both pairs according to care instructions (no spills, stain remover, or anything but detergent) and both came out with light spots all down the leg. very sad to have wasted all that money.
1 I was really disappointed in the shirt. the blue embroidery is a lot darker than what is shown in the photo, and barely stands out against the black. the photo does not accurately depict this shirt. i will be returning.
2 I am always on the hunt for a cute white t-shirt but this one was a miss. it is too boxy (short) and the material is very thin for the price. i gave it two stars because it has nice colors for spring/summer. for reference, i am 5'4 and 115 lbs and i ordered a small. bought it online so i ended up returning it to the store.
1 This top was a big disappointment. i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size 16. neither of them fit well, but one was cut much smaller than the other. i've had this problem with all of the numerically-sized buttondown style of maeve tops. i don't understand why in size 14 & 16, this keeps happening. that's why i purchase two of each. usually one fits and the other doesn't. this time, unfortunately, neither worked. they both were too tight in the arms/shoulders
2 Really cute piece, but it's huge. i ordered an xxs petite and it was unfortunately extremely wide and not flattering. returning.
2 I loved everything about this dress. the fit, the style and the ability to wear in the fall. i wore it once, washed it in gentle/hand-wash cycle, in cold water and laid it out flat to dry- per the instructions- and it shrank at least a full size. it's going back. i am so sad, as i said earlier, i really loved this dress.
1 I wore this suit for the first time yesterday and the black inner lining is leaking and causing stains on the white sections. seriously bummed as this is a super lovely suit.
1 I initially saw this top a few months ago, and fell in love. it ended up selling out in stores, so i ordered it online, where it was back-ordered by a couple of months. i received it this past week, and was sadly disappointed. the design is pretty, but overall the quality is sorely lacking. i wonder if maybe the first batch was good, but when they realized they were so popular, and had more made, the newer batches weren't as good? not sure. the one i got had inconsistent red embroidery, and ther
2 While this is cozy and well made, the problem lies with the unavoidable exposure of the inside of the poncho, which looks unfinished. had the inside been lined or had the hue of the stripes continued through the material, the draped look of this piece would be gorgeous. unfortunately, the faded backside of the pattern (a glimpse of it under model's left hand), viewable through the very large arm holes (and impossible to hide), disrupts the effortless, fluid feel that a poncho should have. i was
2 I like my dresses oversized but this one is ridiculous. it's seriously unflattering. i usually between a m & a l and i got a small and it's still massive. but the slip is tiny. it looks so cute in the picture. but not good in person.
2 I anticipated receiving this skirt as i love a longer pencil skirt and this looks beautiful. i opened it, tried it on, sent it back...it is well made but has too many negatives. first, it is very thick. i ordered size 6 (5'2", 140 lbs.). the size was good, but it is so thick that it adds lots of extra fluff around the waist and abdomen. it is also very stretchy and fits in an unflattering way. finally, and most importantly, it has a back and front vent and both are vented all the way up to the c
2 I love everything by cloth & stone so was excited to see that they made a dress. hooray! i ordered it in the xl, which is my usual size in their shirts. when i tried it on i was so sad to see that it barely fit around my tummy and hips! i am a true size 12/14 and the xl just barely gave me enough room to move. my chest also caused the dreaded "button gape." it is clear that they cut the dress for people with a stick straight figure. so disappointing!!
1 Pants are overpriced and very uncomfortable. to my utter dismay i wore them during a business trip for the first time and ended up with bruises caused by the side zipper. i have been a long time retailer shopper and usually my go to store, however,ending up with a pair of pants that caused me pain was a very big disappointment,
1 I wanted to love this top -- looks so comfy and cute. but hangs like a bag. going back!
2 I wanted to love this sweater. the photo of the model makes it look so soft and warm. i liked the heavy texture and the extra long sleeves. however, after receiving this sweater i tried it on for less than 1 minute. one look in the mirror was enough to make me take it off and return it asap. the knit quickly expanding from small to large right over the bust, combined with the boxy shape was an atrocious combo. it must have added 30lbs to my physique and made my bust look matronly. yikes! this ma
1 I am normally a straightforward 10 - since i saw the other review i ordered down to an 8 - i am still swimming in it.i would say i have about 4 inches of extra fabric in the waist/hips. this is sized way too large. i love the softness of the checkers but i suspect this could get itchy fast on the arms where it touches the wool - but i won't find out cause i'm returning it?on the bright side i might fit a 6 which would be pretty nice.
2 An absolutely gorgeous, but poorly fitting blouse. the bottom part is way too billowy and inconsistent with the fitted top half. got it on sale and still returned it.
2 I was so bummed when this came in...the colors and print are beautiful, but the neck is super itchy because of an elastic/ruffle combo. there is also a liner which is a nice touch, but it's significantly shorter than the top layer which drove me nuts. definitely going back.
1 This dress is absolutely hideous on my physique. ordered a size 6 and it hung on me like a cheaply made tent. i have an athletic built am a 34d. it is going back asap.
2 I wanted to love this shirt, but was very disappointed. i had read other reviews and still ordered, but wish i would have listened. the shirt looks nothing like photos online and is extremely boxy and unflattering. had to send it back.
1 Even on sale sale...this tank is not worth the money. the design in the back is adorable & would expect it to be so much better quality but the fabric is flimsy(think old man white tanks that come in a pack) completely see through and lack of shape..i wanted to love this but definitely photographed significantly better than actuality!
1 This dress turned out to be a huge disappointment!!! i was in loveee with the picture! in real life, not so much. the material felt thin and cheap! and the yellow was super yellow! nothing like the picture. i was so bummed! returned it earlier today...
2 I wish this fit me better. i love the inside fur. it is extremely soft but it doesn't look flattering at all. it makes my shoulders look really broad and it was shorter in the length than i wanted. it wanted it fit over my butt (or cover half) and it sits a little below my waist. unfortunately i am taking it back. great idea though.
2 I wanted to love this sweater and it has some nice distinctive features that make it more interesting than your average cardigan. unfortunately, however, i found that flared in an unflattering manner over my stomach. the chest fit well - though it was very low cut - but then if i buttoned the sweater it made me look like at least three sizes larger.the quality seemed okay, but a bit thin and i was afraid that this would not hold up for long.
2 I was so excited for this dress to come. i am 5&#39;1&quot; and 100lbs so i ordered and xs petite. it was literally falling down around my shoulders and gigantic all around. maybe on someone taller this would have looked great. i was also disappointed that the blue shown online was not accurate. my dress was a much lighter blue. back to the store it goes.
2 Love the tegan tunic version of this dress. i assumed since it looked identical except for the length that the sizing was the same but i was wrong. this runs so big! i got a s in the tegan but the s in this dress looked like an oversized potato sack on. i highly recommend ordering at least 2 sizes down unless you want to look tent-y.
2 Such a pretty fall sweater. nice fit. wore it once out shopping and it snagged :( had to return, sadly.
2 Not at all tapered at waist as suggested here by photos. i have wide shoulders and am slim, and this made me look big all around. i am doubtful a smaller size would correct this- i am 5'10" and ordered a medium. also, it curls under a bit at the waist. one nice thing about the cream is that it is not see through. anyway, i purchased this to go with high waisted skirts but am returning.
2 Ordered this in white and the peachy color- the armholes were gaping. not well designed. i don't recommend this tee at all.
2 Material is awful. not soft at all. colors are much darker than shows online. it is actually very short not at all as it looks on the model. it went back.
1 I loved the idea behind this shirt but it just hangs around the waist with tons of extra fabric. i suspect the model in the photo has the shirt pinned. totally unflattering making the chest look small and your midsection appear huge. maybe if you size down it would be better- xs was not available for me to try. also the lavender color is really washed out...
2 So much extra fabric. not something i would recommend buying online.
2 The other reviews seemed promising and so i ordered these in a 10 petite. i am 5'4" and the length was still long and would either need to be worn with a heel or altered. the length was not what made me send them back though. the quality is very very nice and the fabric thick, stretchy and well made. however, the body hugging fit and flare make these look exactly like a yoga pant but made from nice material. if i were a bit more confident to wear these outside of the gym then they would be great
2 This dress is great if you're very skinny and have no chest. otherwise, it makes you look dowdy. the colors are also quite washed out and do nothing for my complexion.this one is going back.
1 I'm so disappointed this dress didn't work out! i ordered the size medium, post baby i'm a solid dress size 6 or 8 depending on the designer.the cashier was laughing with me how ridiculously huge this garment was when i held it up. also the length was super long, description says 35" which would be mid thigh for me, but this thing hit me mid knee. also, like the previous review the shoulders are tented and poofy. so bizarre and the cut reminds me of a maternity dress, but the shoulders def
1 I'm 5'7" 155lbs and ordered a large. it fit, but the arms were awkwardly short. the finish details on the end of each sleeve almost would have to be pushed back to the elbow for it to look right, which would be okay. however, the interior seam of the neckline is cut jaggedly and isn't even finished with any stitching. it's just tucked haphazardly inside the neckline and isn't sewn--it would unravel with washing. it's soft and snuggly and cute if you get it on super-sale and don't mind it com
2 This shirt ran small and was more sheer than i expected. had to send it back.
1 Dress is nice but can't be worn without tights or you are at a risk of indecently exposing yourself. it is around 30" in length so is more of a tunic than a dress. i'm only 5'1 and it was too short . can't imagine anyone taller even trying to wear this !
2 Runs large. very boxy. white fabric on lower portion of the shirt extremely thin. it did not look as good as in in picture. very disappointing!
2 This sweater/tunic is very poor quality - the seams looked like they were about to come apart as soon as i got it. and, without a chunky statement necklace, it looks like your grandmothers apron. there just isn't any style to it - has to go back.
2 I loved the cut and style of this shirt, so was very disappointed when i put it on and it was very tight and slightly see-through. if you do order it, get it in a size larger.
2 I loved this skirt on the rack. but it was not lined and super scratchy when worn. i could barely wear it for the length it took to try it on. so sad. such a gorgeous skirt.
2 The product looked more or less as expected, but the fabric felt very cheap. not the quality i would expect from retailer. the shirt is also very short, which did not bother me but is something others should be aware of.
2 I did not like this top at all-but had i looked at the fabric prior to purchasing i would not have. it is polyester-i thought it was cotton so there's the first reason i didn't like it. secondly, there is a piece of fabric behind the laces, presumably for modesty that refuses to lay flat. it wrinkles up behind the lacing, making it appear as if one is wearing an undershirt or cami that is not appropriate for the top. it is too long for me, the top hitting at top of thigh.this top is just reall
2 As soon as i saw this dress online i loved it and ordered it! unfortunately it just didn't work for me, i tried it in a small, medium and large. for reference i'm 5'2", 145lbs, 36d. the dress is really pretty in person, but i looked like a little girl in it. my daughter who is 4'9", 100lbs, 34a, also tried it on and she too looked like a little girl in it. the material is beautiful along with the detail at the neckline, however the neckline is not open like in the picture, it's more pushed toget
1 Unfortunately, does not look anything like in the picture. looks like an oversized house robe. i expected much more but was disappointed. i am definitely returning it.
1 Thought this would be great for a laid-back wedding in new mexico, but didn't fit. i am a 12-14 and the 14 barely fit my chest and arms. not flattering. material did not seem very breakthable. had to return. better luck next time.
1 I ordered these twice just to be sure there wasn't a glitch. the color is so off! the picture shows a dark blue denim, but they are not they are a light blue - with whiskering! retailer you need to have a better image of the color because this is so misleading.
2 I ordered this shirt online and just received it in the mail. the floral design is nice, but the mesh fabric in the back is low quality and cheapens the look of the shirt (especially considering the price). most disappointingly, the neck hole is almost as small as the arm holes. with no zipper or button opening i could not fit my head through the opening and, thus, could not even put the shirt on. needless to say, i will be returning it. i ordered the xs, so it is possible that larger sizes do n
2 When i saw this blouse online i thought it looked like a great combination of casual with the elegance of an intricate print. i was so disappointed when it came. the print is not centered in the front or the back. it looks like they were trying to save on the material and just cut it out wherever with no thought to symmetry. for this price the detail of centering the design was expected, especially because this is how it appeared in the picture. loved the blouse, but i will be returning it becau
2 I'm a short girl, but i usually wear tops in a small or medium at retailer. for me, i would have needed this shirt in a size at least one notch smaller than even offered. this shirt is adorable. love the details. i wanted it so bad, which is why i paid so much for a basic t-shirt. still, it was large to the point of frumpiness and could have used some sort of scoop or v-neck to break up the dots.
2 This dress either runs large or just has too much fabric. ordered my usual size, but it is too long and too baggy to do a thing for me. embroidery pretty, but background is more of a muddy gray, then denim as shown. if the smaller size in petite was available, i'd have exchanged it, but it is going back.
2 Material was a tad rough for my liking. the color did nothing for my olive complexion. given the price of this shirt (even with 20% off) i don't think it's worth it. if i'm spending $100+ on a blouse i need to love it and i do not love this one...going back.
2 I'm happy the other reviewers made this dress work because it looked terrible on me. i'm 5,9" and 128 lbs and it made me look like i had gained 25 lbs. as others have said, the pockets make the dress even worse-it's very hard to get them to lay flat. the material is lovely, soft and i liked the gray color, but this dress made me feel like i was wearing something from an asylum.
1 Loved the look of this sweater online. was disappointed when i took it out of the package i was surprised at how stiff and itchy it was. i ordered my usual medium and though at first they shipped the wrong size it was small all over.  it felt cheep definelty not worth the high price. knew it was definitely going back
2 I'm not sure if the top i received was damaged or if the design didn't consider gravity but this is not what i expected. i really want to like this top, but i don't see how i can wear it.
2 This dress is huge. also, i was super disappointed in the fabric. i thought it would be silly like a georgette. but it was coarse, more like a poplin, and thin. i thought it looked cheap.
1 3 tags sewn in, 2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however, this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!
2 I was so curious to see this skirt. it looks just like pic. really gorgeous bold pattern and a faux suede like fabric. my only problem was that i thought there was too much fabric. i love maxi skirts. i am 5&#39;8&quot; and 136 lbs. it was a bit long on me but just had too much fabric. i have slim hips but this made them look larger. skirt is almost ballroom gown like in its fullness. loved it and someone else might love it but for me, it was too much. wish it worked!
1 This shirt had an overpowering vinegar odor when i took it out of the packaging.the mint green color was appealing but the styling did not look good and the smell was too much.
2 Had to return. ordered an xs which usually fits perfect. 34b chest and it was falling off. shoulders and chest!! it was like a sleeping bag. huge fan of retailer but there is a design flaw in this sweater.
2 I'm 5'5" and 140 lbs - hardly super-tiny and the xs was swimming on me. the shoulders are oddly large and this beautiful sweater/jacket just hangs off the body. believe it when they say "oversized styling" - unfortunately will have to return.
1 Poor quality, material looks much thinner and cheaper than pictured.
1 This dress looks nothing like the photo. the sequins are dull, no sheen at all. the faux leather panels and straps look and feel like cheap, shiny plastic. i didn't even try it on, because it was so hideous, when i pulled it out of the box. not remotely worth the price and wouldn't buy it on sale for $20 either. skip.
2 So after reading the 2 reviews, decided to just order my usual size (26), thinking they might be a tad snug. wrong! they were huge! i looked at the size to see if they sent me a size 30 by mistake! unfortunately small sizes sold out. quality is excellent as well as style, so bummed!
2 The front cream panel is completely transparent.i didn't purchase because my bra showed and it would ruin the look with a cami underneath.i wish the fabric were translucent - not so see through.
2 When i saw this online, i wondered why this dress cost so much. i have been keeping my eye on it for some time. loved what i saw, the design and colors and details at the neckline and waist along with pockets but was skeptical. i was waiting for a sale to take a dive and here are my thoughts when i got it:___________pros:- the colors you see online are exactly the same in person.- the jeweled neckline is lovely. it's one thing that drew me to it. this dress had a very sophisticated appeal wh
2 I loved the way it looks on. fit tts. only problem for me was it was so itchy. there is that small amt. of wool in it. if you have any problem with wool this may not work for you
2 I wanted to love this top, but it unfortunately did not work for me. the material has a nice weight and feel to it, and while i love the pattern, the shape leaves something to be desired. the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms, and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big. the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top. for reference, i am 5'10" 140 lbs and typically a size 6. i wear a small in retailer clothes, and got a small in this top. i think an xs would have been to
2 This sweater i bought to go with a navy dress. it is not ivory. it is sortof a blush color???? not at all what i had in mind. the sweater itself is pretty. the back is shorter as someone else described which looks slightly awkward when wearing it. definite return. :(
2 Huge! normally wear a medium and this was huge and very unflattering.
2 I agree with the previous reviewer that the length is not at all what is shown in the picture. much shorter than that. and while the overall detail of the skirt is very nice, the elastic waistband makes it look cheap considering the price...
2 I ordered not one but two sizes of this dress to try on and was hoping to ultimately wear to an event - one 00 petite, one 00. the style, color and cut are all perfect. one not so minor downfall, however. the zippers on both dresses were faulty - they both broke in the same spot, both during the first time just trying them on. i can't get either of them to even budge now - will either need to take back or get fixed. very sad about this.
2 This product looks great on the model, but for anyone with a normal body type, the band in the center is way too tight. i'm a 34a and wear a 27 pants and it was huge in the bust and too small in the waist and hips. the violet one looks much more blue in the photograph, it is truly lavender and purple. i really wanted to love this swimsuit, but instead i had to return it, pay for return shipping, and i am out about $20 now. very disappointed.
2 Unique jacket..... but when i put it on i felt and looked like charlie brown. this will be going back.
2 I loved this shirt so much i bought it in 4 colors. however, two of them shrunk. i was very disappointed.
2 Nice quality fabric and design, but found the armhole cut weirdly and fit of upper bodice strange. wanted to love it but sadly sent it back
2 I so wanted to love this sweatshirt. it is very soft and seems like excellent quality and material. the pattern is pretty, and i envisioned spending hours cuddled up reading in it. unfortunately, the body of the sweatshirt (particularly the front torso area) was too big, and it popped out around me like a balloon. the arms fit well, so i don't think that i could have gone down a size. i was also not keen on the way the neck hung, which was either very stiff and tall around my neck when unfolded
2 Runs extremely large. i got an xs and am 5'4" 115lbs and this would have fit someone who typically wears a size 10-14 and is 5'6" and above. very disappointed with the size. the quality of the fabric wasn't great either. i wanted it to work so bad but just didn't!
2 As a beach cover-up this would be great, but i'm surprised retailer calls this a dress and doesn't show on the model how thin it is. it's pretty sheer and i couldn't get away without layering it.
1 I am sorry to say this blouse is way below all retailer standards. this top should have been placed on sale a long time ago! poor quality in cut, fabric, design. this is a top one would grab at a local box store for 19.99. the colors are not as vibrant. the shoulders ill fitted. and the fabric and threads are very cheap. i was expecting so much more.sorry retailer.....my favorite store to shop!
1 The fabric of this vest is identical to a old white dish cloth! the cut of this vest is also bad! will be sent back!
2 Fits very strange. odd cut. does not look well on.
2 I really love the idea behind this. however, the fit doesn't work for me. i'm usually a s or xs in retailer tops, and i often go with xs for sleeveless tops. this one runs small though - the xs was a bit too small on me based on length and width. the neckline was very high (higher than it looks in the model photo) and the armholes were too big. so i don't think sizing up would improve matters much due to the armhole issue. the other criticism is that the front is not lined.
2 I was aware of the split sleeves when i purchased-- hoping to try something new. they're not attractive. the slit stays open with any movement. i don't think it would be appropriate for work . overall the fit is true to size. i otherwise liked the design, but the sleeves made this a quick return ....
2 This dress was too cute to pass up! i loved it online but when i got it home, it was so tight i couldn't zip up my normal size. the length was perfect on me being 5'7". the fabric and detail was beautiful. if you have a bust, order a size up. beautiful dress just really snug up top.
2 Love the idea of this top, but it is so thin and the sequins look so cheap. the quality reminds me of something you would buy for $20 at a market abroad. definitely disappointed with the quality for the price. will be retuning.
2 I agree with the other review. the fabric and pattern are adorable and well made. the fabric is not sheer at all and great quality;however, the shirt is very wide. i am a 34/26/36 and the small is way too big. the arm holes are perfect but the bottom is uncomfortably large and awkward in appearance.
1 I love the idea of this shirt, but the execution is absolutely horrible. i ordered online and what i received is just a mess. the stitching at the bottom has big globs of black thread. not just a few hanging off, but literally big clumps. a large portion of the stitching on the whole shirt looks like it should be on the underside of the shirt as the where the thread is tied off is on the outside!! the fit is just as big a mess. i always have to buy a large in fitted shirts because i have very br
1 This shirt was great for one wear. after just one wash (followed instructions to dry clean) it lost all shape and now hangs like a bed sheet. terrible waste of money on a pricey top.
2 The design/shape of the dress are quite flattering, flirty and feminine. but.... there is no way that the dress i received is new. the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area. there is no tag... the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp, stiff or new. i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received. undoubtedly this one is going back.dear retailer - please make sure that you do not send pre-owend clothing articles to
2 I really wanted to like this jump suit.  i rarely have problem with retailer clothing.  i'm 5.6, hourglass shape, usually wear size 2.  this jumpsuit runs small, but that's not the only problem.  top part (shirt piece of the jumpsuit) is too short, so it's digging into my lady part.  the color does not look anything like the picture, so overall this piece is failure.  i hope that i find something similar but fits better.
2 I like the design of the dress, but the fabric makes it look cheap. for an expensive dress, i had expected better quality.
2 I really wanted to like this top but unfortunately it was short and the sleeves were just too puffy. it did not look flattering and will be going back.
1 I wanted to like this top so so so so badly. so badly in fact, that after the first size didn't fit, i ordered two other sizes to make sure: xl, l, m. none of them worked i really wanted to like this top. the online photo makes the clothing look so flattering and the shirt is just not....at least on me. the shirt online on the model looks slimming and a lot longer than the actual piece of the clothing. the beaded work is very beautiful, but short causing the very poofy peplum to start at the mos
2 I also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images. it is very thin as others have said. the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs. structured. it is more similar to a cape or shawl design. if you;'re looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design, this is not it. i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design.
2 I was struggling with the options above-- does it fit true to size or is it too small or too large? it is both too small and too large, which is really strange. the model makes this shirt look stunning, but the product is actually very boxy. i am 5' 3", weigh 112 lbs and i typically order anywhere from a 00p-0r/xxs-xs. i ordered this shirt in an xsp and the shirt sleeves were short and the middle was boxy. quite frankly, it looked like a maternity shirt and the structure was not worth the money
1 Retailer has incredible service, and so they let me return this dress even after having worn it. however, this dress cannot be cleaned. i saw a stain on it after the first use, so i first tried hand washing it. however, the black part of the dress came off on the white part, making the stain worse. i then tried dry cleaning it (the care tag allows both) and that produced 3 or 4 new stains where the black rubbed off on the white. it's a beautiful, striking dress (that would be great maternit
1 Beware! there is a reason this sweater is on sale. it is not even remotely the same color as pictured. instead of the lovely antique blue in the photo, this sweater is a faded, boring, teal-green. what a huge disappointment.
1 I should have paid closer attention to the other reviews. i could barely get this blouse over my head! after getting it on, the armholes too are very small. the blouse other than that is pretty and very girlie. i love the pleating and dolman sleeves but i was strangled around my neck. i tried the small but think a medium wouldn't have been much better. it needs a button opening on neck and sleeves. i would have to put this on before makeup or doing my hair. if you have a tiny head and pencil a
1 Wow this is huge! i'm all for the tent-look with the right style, but this was absurd. i could have fit two of me into the width, and with the peplum style, extra width doesn't flatter anyone. the fabric is also so thin that it doesn't hang nicely, it kind of floats around the body. if you want a wide top, then this is perfect, but if you wanted something that hangs nicely, look elsewhere. i purchased a petite s, my typical size.
2 Runs big and looked unflattering. i am petite, might work on someone taller.
1 The fabric of this looks and feels so cheap it's hard to believe this is anna sui. i would say this is unwearable. there is zero stretch and it is made of itchy textured poly fabric that looks like novelty fabric at best. going back asap.
1 I was so excited to order this dress. i loved that it had a normal neck, nice length, and there wasn't a hole in the back. but this dress is just plain awful. the top fit tight across the bust, it flattened me out like i was wearing a too tight sports bra. then the back zipper puckered and bumped up like there is too much zipper for the fabric. i could not get the zipper to lay flat. the fabric is itchy and very cheap feeling. on top of it all the colors are much brighter than they appear in the
1 Bought the dress online and it only has an eye and hook at the top. the waist has no stretch and their isn't a zipper. you have to be a contortionist to get it over your head and shoulders. so cute in the pic but not realistic. going back.
1 I tried on this jumpsuit in black and it was absolutely beautiful. i liked that it looked sort of like a tuxedo, i wore it one time and received so many compliments. when i washed it, however, it shrunk almost 1 size! the pant legs were high water. i even tried washing and restretching it because i loved the jumpsuit but it wouldn't budge, i think because rayon is not stretchable material. to my disappointment, i returned it. i really wished it would have worked out.
2 I really fell in love with this shirt. i am about 5 4 and 110 pounds. i ordered xxs which that was a good size from the chest but this shirt is literally so wide, i was ready to fly. although the model wears this shirt really nicely, i think this shirt is made for a certain type of body. not quite sure what that is.... also this shirt is shorter than what i expected. it looks a lot longer on the model. i had to return this shirt.
1 This skirt is gianormous! i usually take an xl or l, so i ordered both. the waistband on the xl was so huge, i didn't even try it on. i feared it would not stay up! so i tried the large, and it was big as well. i think i would have needed a medium. but as it is, it is not the cute a-line that appears in the picture. (i wonder how they even got it to look like that !?!?!) it is huge, hip-y, and bunchy. yuck.
1 I so wanted this skirt to work, love the design! but, it's way, way too long... i am 5, 5, 116lb, and the small is 1 inch on the floor. i step on the skirt as i walk.
1 The print doesn't necessarily works for everybody.
1 This suit was high quality, and a cute design. however, it is clearly made for a lean body type.
1 I loved the dress, but just not dressy enough after rethinking what i needed. very easy order and return. thanks!
2 I love finding unique retailer pieces that don't require dry cleaning. i was excited to find this shirt, but it's not flattering. the bottom hem is a little tight, which makes the rest of the shirt look bulky. perhaps it would work better on people who have narrow hips. i also didn't like the pink tones when i saw the colors in person. i'll be returning this item.
2 This suit is absolutely gorgeous but it really will only fit a very short waisted gal. it fit perfectly in the body and in the bust but just was not long enough for me to lift my arms up and my size c cup boobs to not pop out. i was very sad to return it :( i am a size 8 with c cup boobs and ordered it in a medium
2 I almost ordered this online to wear to a party later this week, but i'm glad i waited to try it on at the store (i wasn't sure if i'd like the length of the petite or regular better.) i was so disappointed and didn't end up getting either! i have two bailey 44 dresses from several years ago that are much more flattering and incredibly soft/comfortable. this fabric on this dress was much rougher and it really bothered me that the stripes cut off at the side seams and then don't match up from the
1 This sweater is a lovely color and very soft. however, the sweater 'sheds' terribly and the color is very large distracting from the overall appearance. it's also thin and whatever shirt is worn underneath will show through.
2 Don't get me wrong, this is probably cute on someone else, but not me. i looked in the mirror and just laughed, it was that bad. so if you're considering getting this, size down. ordered mine in large and it looks like i'm wearing a barrel. the pink is pretty but the horizontal striping did nothing for my shape. the fabric is soft. i'm just over trying peplums.
1 I wanted to love these, they are cute and warm - but they have absolutely no elasticity. i'm so mad at myself for not reading the reviews because i ended up wasting money on shipping 2 pairs of leggings that i ultimately took right back to the store.
2 Great color, soft fabric, but waaaaay too long. more like a night shirt than a t-shirt.
2 I am 5'6", 130 lbs with an athletic body type and i ordered a size small. these were really baggy in the thigh/quadricep area and made my thighs look bulky. the fabric quality is very nice and i like the idea of them for curvier body types. my son commented that they looked like pajama pants and i agreed.
2 I fell in love with this shirt the moment i saw it!unfortunately, when i went to put it on, there was a hole running down the seam in the back. i went to store to exchange, wore the shirt, and someone tells me i have two holes in the back of my shirt. horrified, i went home, took a look, both holes along the seam! i will be returning this, i really liked this shirt!
2 I have loved the pilcrow hyphen chinos, and have purchased many pairs. however, the last 3 pairs i've ordered are all a different cut now. they are no longer the chino i loved, although they have the exact same name. they are now "boy cut", and are much more narrow through the hips and thighs. nowhere on the description does it say "boy cut". it's not until the package arrives in the mail that i'm saddened to find this changed product with the same number. it really should say this int he descri
1 Even on my 5'1", short-waisted, 100 lb body, this was super short. it was also super boxy. not flattering at all. the blue was a good color but this is going back.
2 After reading the glowing reviews i was excited to buy this on sale. i'm tall and lean, but found the dress looked slightly awkward and off on me compared to the model pictures. firstly, the top has a strange transition to the skirt, with extra fabric you have to either blouse over the skirt or bunch together. if you blouse it and lay flat, it invariably gets bunched as you wear it. this bunching changes the aesthetics of the color blocks, creating less clean lines. i also found the blue, black
2 A beautiful sweater and very flattering on.  the stock photos do not do it justice.  but, i had to give it only 2 stars because it was so itchy that i couldn't even keep it on in the dressing room for more than a minute.
1 I didn't realize that the grey sleeves are attached (i assumed that was just an undershirt on the model). needless to say it looks cheap and poorly made. will be returning
2 It hangs very nicely on the model in the picture but when i put it on it fit tight in the sleeves and upper back but huge in the front. the sweater was also sparkly which made it look cheap. i loved the lace detail in the back but the sweater was returned. did not fit well and was not good quality. very thin
2 I saw the colors and texture of this top and wanted to love it however when i put it on it just did not work. the cut was so strange. it runs very small in the shoulders and then flairs out so much at the waist. i even ordered up a size based on reviews. i ordered an 8 when i normally where a small (6) in things. the shoulders were still too small and it was way too big every where else.
2 The shirt is cute, but there is no way that the length posted on the website is correct--it's a crop top. this was returned.
1 This looked beautiful online, but the skirt isn't 100% silk - the strips of fabric have different fiber content levels, with most of them containing some level of polyester. parts of the skirt felt like plastic to touch, and one strip has a very prominent gold sheen that looks cheap. overall very disappointing - this is not at all the beautiful silk skirt that it appears to be online.a definite return. i wouldn't even recommend this at first or second cut.
1 I wore this bodysuit once. it had a hole under the arm when i took it off
2 After reading the reviews i placed an order because it was the only top that caught my eye on the entire price downs. lately all my usual l/10 sizes from retailer turn out huge so i ordered a size smaller from what i usually wear. all would have been ok if the top wasn't so darn short. for reference i'm 6 ft tall, 160 lb. it's weird that this top looks completely the opposite of the model on the photo, from a loose looking fit with longer sleeves looking like a stylized sweatshirt that is not what
2 I wanted to like this sporty dress too. i teach at an elementary school and like to get down on my knees st my students level - plus we can get messy most days with our learning and most days are go - go - go being "on" every second...the armholes were cut too big and weirdly squared. i didn't like the middle "ridge" either as it was unflattering. it was returned.
1 I rarely write a really negative review and retailer is my favorite store ever. but this dress is awful. i ordered the black and white. the fabric is very poor quality. the colors are washed out. i almost didn't try it on, but i did and found that, for me, the fit was terrible (though some of the reviewer pictures are cute).
1 I had to review this because i purchased before any reviews were up and now that i've received this dress i'm appalled by all the positive reviews!!! this dress is hideous in person. seriously hideous. and even if you can get past the drapery fabric, it's incredibly restricting. the picture online is so misleading. the dress isn't even an ivory it's more of a pea green! so disappointed.
1 I really loved the way this shirt looked on me. it's forgiving and flattering, and really lightweight. the fabric, however, couldn't even withstand half a day's wear without snagging 3 times and developing a hole right in the center. i have no idea how this happened, as i wasn't wearing or near anything that could have pulled at it. such a shame. this could have been a staple wardrobe piece for me.
2 The sweater material was really soft and seemed well-made. the back is an interesting twist, but the material creases easily; i can see it looking messy by the end of the day. the main reason i returned it though was because it runs very large. i got my usual s, and i could have sized down 1, maybe even 2 sizes. i didn't like it enough to try a smaller size.
2 This dress was cute in the photos but wore like a sack when i put it on. great quality, fabric was lovely, just a little sparkle at the hemline, scallops were great but i put it on, i immediately took it back off and put it back in the sack to return. love the look, it just was terrible on me. i'm petite, 5'0" and weigh 110# so i'm not large but the dress made me look like an oompaloompa.
2 This skirt is very pretty, but not only does it run small but only a small portion of the waistband is elasticized, so there's very little stretch. for those of us with a significant difference in our waist and hip measurements, there's no way to get this skirt on past the hips.
1 Bought the gold pair and dripped something on them so spot cleaned them with water only. my white washcloth turned bright yellow. the food came out but surrounding area was super faded. so i returned them, took the second pair home, wore them a few times, they stretched out so much, washed them in cold water and they have splotches that are really light. these pants are way too much trouble.
2 I love the design and the fabric, but the fit is just off on this dress. the area around the bust is just not fitted well. the wrap portion of the dress in this area gaps and does not lie flat. that is an easy enough fix with a good seamstress, but the waist also sat too high on me (maybe i'm long waisted, who knows?), so between the super high waist and the flannel-type fabric, it just looked kind of like a bath robe on me. i wish it weren't so. i was so hoping for a cool plaid dress that i cou
1 It's a cute top but once i washed in cold water and laid flat to dry it shrunk and lost it's shape. very disappointed. i am going to return top.
2 I had fallen in love with the coral dress that was somewhat like this one and came out a few months ago. but the problem i'm having with this one is the same problem i had with the coral one. they are all flawed in their construction! i had eventually tried 3 size 16s in the coral because each one was flawed. on one, one side hung longer than the other, and on all 3, the top design did not line up with the bottom design. this blue one is the same way! the top design does not line up with the bot
2 I'm worried about the quality of the shirt. it looks like it may snag easily. i've decided to keep it, so hopefully i will get some use out of it. in hindsight i would have not bought it when considering the price and quality of the shirt.
1 Looks fitted on, but this just turned out to be an oversized muumuu on. the fabric also felt cheap.
2 I bought this in the white, size m (140lbs., 5'8", 34b) because i wanted a baggy fit, which i got, so this is tts. the white is more of an off-white rather than a bright white, which i like because i happen to be looking for an off-white tee. and the shape is good--even in a larger size, this tee nips in at the waist.however, the quality of this tee is lacking, as it is the typical, cheap, marled, slightly see-through material that seems to be everywhere these days and the band on the back of th
2 This piece didn't make sense to me.  maybe it's bc i'm a yankee fan but it reminded me of a high end baseball jersey that was sheer.  i didn't think it was office appropriate but too dressy for casual wear.  it went back.
1 I loved the color and design until i tried it on in the store. i am 5'5" with a slender build. i tried my usual xs but couldn't manage to put this shirt on me without risking smear my makeup or scratch my face by the elastic band at the neckline. the band is so small even fully stretched out. i have a normal sized head just in case you wonder... i gave up after wrestling with it. i can only imagine how uncomfortable to wear something with a tight elastic band choking me...funny... but not funny.
2 This top is exactly what i was hoping for except it is missing the drawstring. so disappointing, mailing it back.
2 As another reviewer wrote.. this is not the same jean featured on the website. same cut and style but it's a light denim wash with wiskering and worn look at the knees. i called customer service to see if this was a mistake and they said there was not really a way to check it unless i exchanged them. i didnt want the same wrong jeans again so i opted out ... too bad they are cure.
1 This dress fits awfully. it's not short, as pictured in photo. it hit just above my knees. it looked like sack. i would've, also, felt like i was choking  all night with it clasped around my neck. it, potentially, may look okay on someone who is very tall, skinny, and lanky, but i have my doubts about that too.
1 Cut out design, no seems or hems. very disappointed in retailer
2 The bottom part of this romper is easy to put on, but the top is very poorly designed. it needs a zipper at the side or less of a yoke along the back. you have to wrangle your limbs in somehow and i was afraid it might tear. once i got it on, it fit perfectly though. getting out of it was a disaster. i had to ask a saleswoman for help and was so afraid it might rip. overall, i was crushed that it didn't work out because the print is super cute and it is very flattering.
2 I originally got these in a 29 petite and thought they fit great right out of the bag (i'm usually a 6/8).. and within an hour of wearing them (to retailer, actually), the knees had gotten so baggy that they looked absolutely ridiculous; i've never had jeans do this. the salesperson at retailer agreed that they seemed very odd. i exchanged for a 28p at her suggestion, and i just hate them. i'd say the smaller size seems every so slightly small, but nothing major - but the waist actually folds over a
1 After reading the previous reviews i thought sizing down would be a great idea. as soon as i pulled it out of the bag i knew that the xs/s was still wayyy too big. for reference i am 5'3 and a 34ddd and usually wear an 8 but this thing was enormous. it was shapeless and boxy but done so horribly it looked like i was pregnant. it has an adjustable draw string at the bottom which helps to make you look like a balloon. such a disappointment. the design was lovely and it looked very high quality and
1 I ordered a size 16 in the orange. it ran a size smaller than normal size 16 maeve tops. the quality of the material was terrible. it wrinkled and was also so thin that you need to wear a tank underneath. that messes with the look of the lace on the top. the color of the orange was gorgeous.
2 Description is wrong. not a swing tunic. more long and straight. keep that in mind when buying this. if you have hips, this might not be the top for you
1 I bought this very cute t-shirt in sky. wore it once, then washed it according to the washing instuctions (machine washable/dryable). this t-shirt turned into a crop top!!!!! i can't wear it. it's going to goodwill. i would suggest that you air dry this shirt, if you want to take the chance that it won't shrink up several inches.
2 This is a very pretty sweater, a bit boxy and short but cute. i am 5'1" and ordered the regular xs in black. the thing i did not like about this sweater was the gold thread through the back lace. i would have kept this if it was plain black lace. just did not like that look.
2 You can adjust this dress a bit with the straps but it's huge! the colors were also a bit grayish which i didn't expect.
1 The yellow is not as bright as the pic and the tee shirt base color is more off white/oatmeal making the shirt look much more drab in person than in the pics. fit was ok but nothing special about this and will be returning.
1 There was nothing i liked about this coat. it was definitely not designed with a chest in mind. the pins on the straps were already coming off the first time i tried it on. i usually like oranges too, but even this color turned me off.
2 This top is really cute, but the threads underneath the shirt scratch your torso. i suggest wearing a tank underneath to protect your skin.
2 The color is as pictured. good quality. it's lined. the zipper in the back makes it look updated. i ordered my usual size. small petite size 6. it fit perfectly. i'm 5 feet and 120 lbs. hourglass figure. i had high hopes. i have hips and short, heavy legs. the skirt only emphasized my flaws. if you've got great legs you will do well with this. i do own other short skirts. but the fact that is less tailored in look makes it better suited for a younger gal. if you're on the fence give it a try. it
1 I'm usually a maeve fan. i found this top to look cheap and fit poorly. it is also very thin material and showed everything.
2 I had high hopes for this top but it didn't work for me at all. it shows your bra straps perfectly. plus, it was so big and boxy that it made me look about 10 pounds heavier. no thanks!
2 When you look at the online pictures of the navy colored dress, the stripes are diagonal. however, that is not the case with the dress in person. the stripes are all horizontal and not that flattering. such a bummer because i love maeve dresses and thought this would be a great addition to my summer dress rotation. alas, not very flattering, so back it goes.
2 Woah, these jeans looked ridiculous on me. i felt as though it was 1987 and i was raiding my mom's closet. the combination of the light wash, the crop leg and high waist with the odd stitching around the midsection make this a no. it really accentuates any pouch you may have. i was looking for a high waisted denim but these are very unflattering. i am 5'3" / 140 curvy. no, no, no!
2 Love the top, but very small to the size. ordered a medium and had to send back in exchange for x-large.
2 This dress makes me so sad...the textured stretchy fabric, color, length, and overall swingy fit are spot on. as another reviewer noted though, the armholes and neck totally ruin the dress. the neck is tiny, which i could have gotten over once it was on, but the arm holes were just awful - too big all around (too tall of a cut plus too wide of a cut). basically, you could see my bra plus from the front there was unflattering exposure near the armholes. it could have been so good, but alas, but t
2 Oh such a classic retailer look for summer! a vintage pattern on a crisp cotton fabric. i was immediately drawn to it. but wait- there is a sort of wrap around tie at the waist, creating the look of an apron. yes. it looks like one is wearing a full apron. or scrub dress. why?? this would have been sooo much better as a simple shift or a skirt/blouse combo.
1 I waited three months for these pants. when they finally arrived, i was mostly pleased. they seemed like the staple pant everyone is raving about. and they should have been.problem one: they bag out. i got one wear out of them before i needed to wash and hang to dry (regained shape then).problem two: the crotch split! in the front! i'm a teacher. i sincerely hope no one noticed! i read other reviews about this problem and don't know if i got a bad batch or if a similar fate is awaiting other
1 The fabric is very nice on this wrap, but it wears like a blanket.
1 I was so excited to receive this dress only to come find out that it was not tweed, not the same colors as the picture, spandex material, the fit runs smaller than most of their dresses and the sleeves are capped. i love retailer and prefer their clothes above all other brands but i was extremely disappointed in this dress.
2 I loved the cut and the stretch in the material made them comfortable, however i found that the material was unflattering for thicker thighs because it tended to cling to the body. it would have been better with some sort of lining as it would have prevented the flimsy material from highlighting imperfections. bottom of pants are not hemmed, so if you want a clean look, you may not like the edges. these were returned immediately as it just did not work for me.
1 I wanted to love this sweater but it is a return. it is a very weird fit, very thick, rug-like material and unfitted. the shoulders are bulky, the top is big and the booty is small. i am 5'2", 34c and typically wear a small. the arms were very long, way too long. i will say other than that the top was true to size, may look okay on someone who had a larger chest and a smaller bum!
2 The dress is too loose and runs too big
2 I really wanted to like this because the color is beautiful and the knit is obviously good quality. but the shape is impossible to work with. it doesn't just run big, it just hangs there. really disappointing. it'll have to go back.
2 This looks cute on the model but was way too big, loose and sloppy for me. i probably needed a petite size. i ordered a regular xs, but returned it. it is an okay black top, nothing great.
2 I tried on this sweater...love the flowing top, and it looked like the seam would hit right under my bustline.wrong.the seam came right across my bust on a medium; sized up to a large, same thing. this shouldn't happen! not sure who this would actually flatter.the sweater is high quality, and the colors are perfect. the fit needs work.
2 I was very disappointed when it arrived and had elbow length sleeves. from the photo, it looked like full length sleeves. it went back.
1 The dress is pretty, i ordered a 4 and 6 not knowing how it ran, i took both back the neck is too tight!
2 I purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailer's recent 20% off sale. i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate, but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night. they both seemed to be just what i was looking for. i ordered a 4 regular and a 6 regular, as i am usually in between sizes. the 4 was definitely too small. the 6 fit, technically, but was very ill fitting. not only is the dress itself short, but it is very short-waisted. i am only 5'3", but it fe
1 I agree with the other reviewer about the great colors, but when i took this off the rack to try one, you can see through both layers of fabric. i thought, insulting quality, for the price. i imagine the holes would start after one wearing.
2 I was very disappointed by the fit of this top. it is quite short (especially in the back) and very wide. i did not find it flattering. on a positive note, the fabric is nice and thick - very warm layering piece for fall. for sizing reference, i'm 5'5'', 122 lbs, and took my usual size xs.
2 I was hesitant to buy this because it is double breasted which isn't my first choice. that was the least of the problems with this jacket. i love sparkle, and i love beautiful detail, none of the elements by themselves was a problem. the sum of the parts didn't work, though. the end result was an unflattering, confusing mess. the silhouette plus the frayed edges, plus the sequins plus the vent in back plus the huge buttons plus the double breast, plus the zipper were just too many things to go t
2 Nice fabric, great color, would be lovely ... on someone with a straight-and-narrow body type. for ladies with curves, take a pass--too much like maternity wear, and not in that elegantly slouchy kind of way. the straight-up "is she or isn't she" kind of way.
1 This may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried. the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo, absolutely garish. the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties, it just looks cheap. the skirt is an antebellum nightmare.  i did not even want to try it on, it's that bad. i considered adding a photo, but was too horrified.for reference, i'm 5'10", approximately the height/ size of the model, but it was shorter than the photo depictes. i wanted to like it,
1 Uhm no. oh dear, no. i was initially drawn to this blouse's lovely fabric, the color and pattern are truly stunning. i decided to give it a try because it seemed somewhat boxy, oh boy was i right. sadly, this is one of the least flattering tops that i've ever tried on at retailer. it might be a great maternity top, though.
2 Alas, i so wanted to love this. the photos of the models wearing it look gorgeous -- flowy, drapey, ultimate grecian goddess. but it just doesn't work unless you're super-skinny. too much material. almost bulky; strange looking. the print is so beautiful -- i love the pink floral, and i love the whole idea of the dress. but it just doesn't work. have to send it back. (i'm 5'6", 135 pounds, 38-30-38, and i ordered a 10.)
2 Weird fit and the tie just add to the problems. i think i'd like this a lot more if it were just an open cardigan without the tie. the tie seems like an after thought. it's flimsy and it just makes anyone wearing this look like a house -- no matter there size. i ordered a medium black and it's already in the mail!
1 This looks nothing like it does on the website. it runs small and the colors are so muddy. it doesn't drape nicely and i a musually an xs and this was short, stiff and plain ugly. sent it back immediately.
1 I tried this dress on in the store. i loved the fabric and color, but the fit was huge, no matter how much i sized down. there are full dresses and tunics that are supposed to be loose, but this was shapeless in an unflattering way. i was attracted to the style and color, but the execution left much to be desired.
1 1. this looks so cute on the model, doesn't it? i have no idea where you wear a suit with hot pants, but it looks cute.2. that said, keep in mind the model is probably 6 feet 10 inches tall. i'm 5 feet 6 inches tall, and this jacket came down to my knees. i'm not kidding. the 3/4 length sleeves were at my wrist, so more like 7/8 sleeves.3. i'm normally a size 12 in cartonnier jackets, but this only comes s, m or l. the medium is really a size 10, which was too tight across the shoulders and
1 This dress is huge. i am normally a l-xl regular in retailer brands. i love a loose, flowy dress. after trying one on in the store (just a random returned petite xl) i ordered the petite medium. and it was still huge and not flattering. so sad. i wanted to love this- loved the material and colors, but way off.
2 I love this top (so cute and comfy!), but i wore it twice, washed it once on gentle and layed to dry.....now there are 2 small holes in the front. for as much as it cost, i would have expected it to be more durable. very disappointing, especially since i don't live near an retailer and can't take it back easily......
2 Beautiful in pictures and i loved it before i tried it on. as the other reviews state, it is short and wide. i like the top so much, i am going to try to add some gathering across the back to offer some shape. otherwise it is an unflattering shapeless box :(
1 The fabric was nothing special (i usually like a cotton/silk blend woven fabric, but this was stiff feeling) and the pattern was cute. but what made me return it was the fact that 1) the rose gold glitter dots are puffy paint. literally. puffy. paint. and 2) the dots were not quite dry on my top when it arrived. parts of the paint came off on my fingers and the top was stuck to itself because of it. i could barely unfold it.i'm sure this could have been cute, but who wants a top that looks lik
2 I really wanted to love this shirt. the snowflake and stripe design is really cute, and the fabric is of nice quality. it's a very loose fit, which i would've been willing to work with, but... as mentioned in previous reviews, the shoulder seam rests in an odd place on your upper arm, and there are little bumps in the fabric on the arms that appear similar to what happens if you leave a shirt on a wire hanger too long. it looks like you have nubby little wings coming out of your arms. not attrac
2 I wanted to love this dress - and did from the picture online. when it arrived, the black already looked faded and old. also, the embroidery looks like a grandma, but not in a cute vintage way. the fabric is stiff, which causes a boxy, unflattering look. had to return it.
2 The dress is absolutely beautiful in person. the blue stripes are a bit brighter and the print on top is more muted. it's unique and sure to turn heads. being 5'2" i tried on the small petite. this size is usually perfect (lengthwise) for me. however this dress was about 2" too long. another complaint is the style of the top half. the model in the picture seems to be hiding the puffiness of the top half. the top half puffs out and made me appear much wider than i am. not a good look on anyone.
1 Was so excited to get this dress because i thought it was cute and i love flowy and big dresses - however this looks huge. the material is not soft so it doesn't fall well. it just stays proofed out so from the back you look like a giant!!
2 Unfortunately, this dress did not work for me like the other reviews. i am 5'8, 130lbs, and the dress looked like a tent on me (size s). there was just way too much material at the bottom. also, while the dress is lined, both layers are quite thin- not see through, but i would not call them substantial either. for the cost of the dress and the material, it wasn't worth paying more to have it tailored to fit better.
1 I was very disappointed in the quality of this top. the first time i wore it it snagged right in the front. i had to pull the thread under so it wasn't exposed. i put it in the wash in the gentle cycle and it was destroyed with several more snags when i removed it from the machine. this top is extremely delicate and doesn't withstand normal everyday casual wear although it's s casual lightweight sweater. now it's just a wear around the house ratty throw around shirt.
2 These pants looked worn, washed & old looking when i received them! the quality is super thin cotton as if it's been washed a million times & is about to fall apart! the workmanship is terrible. you can see loose stitching all over. the top portion is too tight & looks terrible stretched out. i liked absolutely nothing about this pants except the idea of them from the picture online...
1 I was hoping these would be like some of the lace shorts i bought from retailer last year that i loved so much. sadly, no. first of all they run small. i am between a s and xs in most brands, bought a s in these because i like my shorts on the looser side. these felt a little snug and short, but i decided to keep them. the first time i washed them, they were ruined. i followed the directions exactly and even put them in a lingerie bag in the washer, plus a delicate cycle, no dryer. the lace is man
2 I am typically a small/6 in dresses, but i should have gone with the other reviewers and sized down. it had no shape, but hung like a paper sack. the armholes fit perfectly though, if i had sized down they may have been too tight. i am 5'6" 140 lbi will return, too bad because it is a pretty dress!
2 This dress overwhelmed me. i'm 5 feet tall and the print and material just took over.
2 I thought this dress looked gorgeous on the model. so floaty and light. when it came, i found it to be the exact opposite. the hem is so heavy and laid on me like a potato sack. it had way too much material at the bottom and weighed me down unfortunately.
2 This tunic could be great but there is some weird construction going on at the armhole. first of all, the armhole is way too low! second, there is a totally unnecessary side seam zipper under the arm. since this is a tunic it slips over the head no problem. no need for the side zipper, it adds bulk and distorts the way the fabric should hang at the side.
2 I liked the design and the shirt did fit well enough, but the thin fabric does not justify the price. it looks like it will get holes in it after a wash or two.
1 I ordered this in a size 1 which i thought would be a small and it was very, very wide. it is very short too. i typically wear a small and am 5'8" and 132 lbs. it's going back unfortunately. very soft material though.
2 I so wanted to love this top. i ordered the "blue", which is blue and orange. i thought the orange would be brighter, it is not. it is a dull color. also, i'm usually a medium, this top fits fine on my shoulders/bust 34c, but it was huge around the waist, making me look a lot larger. if this top were a bit smaller around the waist, i would keep it, but it is going back.
2 This top was gorgeous and fit perfectly right out of the bag, with only a quick ironing. unfortunately, the first time i washed it (cold water, hang dry), it shrunk so that it no longer fits across the bust without tape where it was once roomy, is much shorter, and feels rougher to the touch. like another reviewer said (unfortunately, after i had purchased and washed!), i wish the label would have just said to dry clean only, because i regret washing it and would have done otherwise if i had kno
2 The design is very strange. the inner slip is quite form-fitting, but the dress on top was just massive, like a sack. on the sides were tassels that i could not figure out what to do with. they looked weird just hanging off the side, so i tried to knot them like a belt. overall, this dress was not attractive on. it looks much better on the model. the coloring on the snakeskin print dress is also different in real life, harsher red, blue, and white print not the dusty rose and plum pictured.
2 The top is cute, but when i received it, it did not feel like cotton. the tag says 100% viscose. i hope retailer can be more accurate with fabric content in the future! on the plus side, the return was no problem.
2 The quality of the shirt is top notch. the fabric is lightweight and comfortable.now the cons:this top is cut like a square and fits wide which is not apparent in the photo. definitely not for me.
2 I finally found this dress in store today and wow! i cannot believe this cheap looking dress is from ms! they have been among the top at retailer and this unlined, baggy, cheap velvet sub is a shock! what happened? only the color is nice. please get back to yourself ms!
2 Appears much more sleek in the photograph. in real life, this shirt looks more like a pajama top. thin, extremely casual, not worth the price i paid- even in black. will be exchanging it tomorrow.
1 I usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops, ordered this top in an s and it was so wide on the sides and huge it fit like a tent.  not even remotely flattering.  i thought about ordering it in an xs, however, i could tell the xs was still going to have way too much fabric.  back it goes.
2 I purchased this in the yellow xs. it is very comfortable, but extremely see-through. you'd have to wear a slip or something underneath it, but i'm not sure what would work based on the style, and even if i wore a strapless bra it was still see-through. unfortunately i had to return it.
2 This shirt is not near as nice as it may look the fabric is just ok it runs large i ordered a xs and the neck line was huge and gaping not worth the money even on sale
1 This dress is so cute! i went to the store to try it on and although i knew the dress would fit i could not get the zipper up. my mom, the sales lady and i all tried to get the zipper up and it would not move past the ribbon. i wish i could have bought this dress but i can't without a working zipper. i tried a size up and every dress at the store that was my size and none of them worked. please fix the zipper problem so i can have this dress!
1 I wanted this jacket to fit on me like in the photo, but i guess my frame was still to petite. the fabric was also on the cheap end
1 Was really excited for this dress and couldn't be more disappointed. doesn't look anything like the pictures.the fabric feels...cheap. it came wadded up in a ball and is a wrinkled mess. looking beyond that, i tried it on and thought i had put it on incorrectly. unfortunately not. the top half doesn't sit correctly. it's so bizarre that it seems like a flaw in the design. it doesn't sit on your shoulders, but doesn't look right off your shoulders. the neckline is very high. also, front b
2 This top runs extremely large and has a very unflattering cut for those without a straight figure. i have 36ddd boobs and a muscular, curvy frame. this top adds about 20lbs.
1 I was so excited to purchase this dress; i love all shades of grey for winter clothing, i love knits, and i have loved other maeve dresses. however, i simply cannot fathom how poorly this is designed--it fits absolutely nothing like it appears to on the model, to the point that i wonder if i might have received a defective dress.for reference, i am 5'5", slender and small-boned but also curvy (hourglass). my bust is 36 c, hips about 37-38. i normally wear a small in maeve dresses. maybe it's j
1 This dress comes with a built in fupa. literally there is extra material at the lower abdomen that sticks out and is very unflattering.
1 I'll start by saying, over the years, i get more and more frustrated by the lowered quality of retailer's products. this dress represents all of my frustration. cheap, cheap cheap material. low thread count. elastic!!! around the end of the sleeves that rubs the cheap fabric against your arm. i mean, this dress is a total disaster - and looks nothing like the photograph shown.
2 If you are over 25, this top probably is not for you. it is absolutely see-thru. great style and beautiful light fabric, but you can see right thru it.
1 I didn't have a problem anticipating the fit of this dress. i felt with the drawstrings on each side i could make it work. i usually take a large and even ordered a medium as i had read all the reviews of it running big. when i got the dress, i was beyond disappointed. it is a heavy, itchy polyester-like fabric, not a thin rayon looking texture like the picture shows. it is also a deep black, not the plum color in 4/5 photos. but most importantly, i am 5'8" and the dress is very short on me. it'
1 When i tried this top on, i started laughing. the two rows of ruffles are made of a starchy thick cotton, which, instead of falling by the hips, juts out like wings. it's also huge. cute idea, wrong material and placement.
1 I was disappointed with the style and quality of this dress. it poofs out funny in the waste and it just looks very unflattering. i'm sending it back.
2 Looks like a pregnancy top. a lot gathers in front and back. added 10 pounds to me. not flattering on, much longer than on the model. and the color is not white. it's white with a weird tan/ taupe stripe.i returned it same day i received it, which was disappointing.
1 I loved the photo of this dress. upon examination of the dress (and trying it on) after receiving in the mail, the dress shown online is nothing like the dress i received save for the pattern. the dress i received has a side zip as well as a belt and no pleats on the top. the bottom is also cut straight across not as it appears in the photo. turns out it is not as flattering as it should appear.
2 Unfortunately, this dress is shaped like a sack and has no shape to speak of. i have sent it back for a refund :( too big, too shapeless.
1 Ordered this vest on line and returned it due too poor quality .
1 The color is completely off! i loved the way this vest looks in the picture! i was excited to have that vest but unfortunately what i received in the mail was a huge disappointment. it came wrinkled and the brown is not as rich as it is in the picture. very pale. horrible.
2 I pretty much am in agreement with the first, original reviewer on here. big disappointment, especially if you have hips and are busty._____________pros:- great breathable fabric.- cute look overall.- sash in front brings it all together.- buttons are hidden under a panel of fabric, which is a nice touch.____________cons:- runs very small in the bust. normally, i can wear a 10 or 12 with most of retailer's stuff. i tried on a 12 and it fit everywhere with entirely too much room i
2 This top is tight across the bust (i am a 32dd cup) and more trapeze-shaped than the picture shows. if you are smaller busted, it may not flare out as much.also- the sz 10 is what was tight - and i usually wear a sz. 4 or 6, or small-size top/blouse.in the end, this wasn't very flattering as it looked more like a maternity top.
2 When i wore this the two times i did, i got a ton of compliments. it runs small, and is a bit tight when sized correctly but its really stunning. after the second wear, the fabric under the arms frayed and its now unwearable. i have to return it and am so disappointed. sadly, i would not recommend buying it for that reason.
1 This is a cute top but i wore it for around 5 hours and lo and behold i had smurf skin. i did not sweat in it but the color transferred to my underarm area and bra and it did not come off in the shower!! i guess it's going to have to wear off. thank goodness it was not a hot day!! i hope that i can return it.
2 I love this brand, i literally live in their tops.. this one is a bit of a disappointment. it is made out of fabric that feels cheap, reminding me of a tissue tee instead of the normal thicker quality of all their other products. it's very thin, and see through. unless wearing a camisole/slip underneath, you have to have the perfect bra and pants situation going on underneath- no muffin tops or back fat!!i got the black, and am keeping it only because i love the design, need a black top desperat
2 Not flattering and not the color it appears online. this is really a pink shirt.
2 Beautiful print, however as the previous reviewer mentioned it is very sheer, much sheerer than the product shot shows. i was expecting to be able to wear a nude bra under this without a cami, however my nude bra was completely visible.the top also ended at the middle of the zipper of my jeans, so much shorter than the tunic length shown, and the bottom half of the sleeves ballooned out much more noticeably in person (the top half of the sleeves are slim, and the bottom half are looser).over
1 This fell apart after wearing it once. for the price, it should hold up better. it's too delicate.
1 I was very shocked to receive this dress with a rusty zipper, looks like crusty white rust . see attached pictures. the dress fabric is very nice and i did try it on and it is a very nice fit, lined with a little stretch but my gosh what a cheap poor quality zipper that looks like it was old and exposed to moisture because the metal parts have a white crusty substance! retailer you really need to check your merchandise before sending to your loyal customers. lately the quality has been declining a
2 I have a holding horses dress similar to this one from about a year ago.  i loved the swinging fit without it looking like a maternity dress.   the fit and style of this dress is wonderful, it's the color that killed it for me.   i ordered the "orange" because i liked the photo on the model.  when the dress arrived in the mail, i could hardly take it out of the package and try it on.   the color is almost neon orange.   too much for this redhead.  hard to wear that bright neony color.  not sure
2 Poor quality. i expected much more from the material.
2 Wow! this sure is close fitting, as in suction cups to your body! yikes, definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves. to me, it seems like the material will wear well. i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it, not sure. it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs, it won't work. i ordered the medium and am usually a small. the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy. i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas.
2 This dress was not what i had hoped! from the online pictures, i had high hopes, but the fit was really wonky and the material seemed cheap. the arm holes were too big and made the dress seem more like a bathing suit cover up than a classy summer dress. needless to say, it's going back!
1 This is an extremely flattering dress. i couldn't resist buying it, even though i didn't come into the store looking for a dressier dress, which i feel this is. once i tried it on, i had to purchase it. its one of those things that i know i won't regret because at some point, an occasion will show up that i'll wear it to. its soft, comfy and flowing and accentuates the body's curves without being too tight or clingy. its a classic!
2 The fabric felt cheap and i didn't find it to be a flattering top. for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40.
2 Wanted to love this- i did love the color and thought the style would work for anyone. but i tried it on and immediately took it off with a definite "not keeping this." the side zipper- a complaint by many, really made it uncomfortable. also, the detail under the bust would not lay flat and just looked odd. loved the material and definitely the green print. but i knew i would never wear it. just looked blah.
2 Unfortunately, this sweater let me down! i love retailer, especially their sweaters, but this one fell flat. it was tight on the arms, and didn't hang well on my body. it was odd in length and added about 20lb to my frame. i kept it because i wanted to force it to work, alas, i just donated it. hopefully it fits someone else better than me..
2 I waited six weeks for this dress to arrive and was so disappointed. loved the skirt part of it. but the top, which i guess i didn't see in photo was pleated as well, made my bust look huge and it puffed out on sides. would have been a wonderful summer dress, flowing and cool.
2 I was excited to get this romper, but it just didn't work. i'm petite with a large bust and the blousy design of the top portion just hung like a bag on me. returned.
2 This sweater looked so promising with the tie waist and pretty lacy edging, but turned out to be a disappointment. it was much shorter than it looks in the photos and barely came to my hips. and the plum color was much darker than i expected, more of a dull brownish-burgundy.
1 I should have listened to the previous review on-line before ordering. unfortunately this will go back as the design fit and proportions are simply off. i love uniquely shaped wraps like this, but this one didn't make the cut for me.
2 This sweater was just okay. i am happy to pay $100 or more for a sweater but this one was somewhat itchy, and not the quality i expected for that price. i may have kept it if it were at about half the price, but it just was not worth it. retailer prices seem to be going up and up and the quality less and less. i had similar experiences with a couple of shirts that i ordered over the summer. looked great in the photos, but unfortunately in person were not quality garments.
2 The top is nice, good quality, etc.... but how do you keep the 'off the shoulder' off the shoulder? mine keeps inching up until it's just a boring white top with a strange loose neckline.
2 No, but i'm not a small person. i'm 5'8, a size 6 on top, 8 on bottom. i don't love this on the model online, but i saw this on naomi's blog, love taza, and thought it looked amazing. i tried it on in my retailer, and while they only had a m/l, since i'm tall, i figured that'd be fine. oh. no. not fine. it's huge. like, it could almost cover a twin bed. it was a couple inches longer on me than on the model, and doesn't arc down in a drape nearly as well, so just looks, huuuge. i thought i was bein
1 Ordered on line and thought these are a great quality as i pulled them out of the box. tried them on and found minimal elastic for the waist. within minutes of wearing, the waist fell down past my hips...glad i was at home. looks cute but will not stay up.
1 I was excited to see these jeans since they came in petite sizes and had a short inseam... unfortunately after ordering/returning several pairs, i found out that these are actually not petite jeans. please beware that if you are ordering these for the shorter inseam, they are actually 28 in... not 24 in as in the description. other than the inseam issues, they fit like typical paige denim.
1 I tried this on at my local store. i love the look and the color of the blue tank and wanted very much to like it. alas, it was not to be. the material is super thin (almost see-through) and it is of poor quality. i did not buy it.
2 I thought i would love this shirt because it goes along with my style, but i returned it immediately. it runs so large! the colors are faded, and the trim of the shirt curl over, so it looks cheap and frumpy. i do not recommend this! it hits in all the wrong places.
2 Big pockets make it look more like a bathrobe than a coat. there are no internal pockets and the loops for the belt are pretty skimpy - just a bit of string. the color is great, but the quality leaves something to be desired.
2 Bought this cami/tank on sale which i'm glad but it has a flap underneath like a bralette but not fitted..it kinda just drapes under the cami...the problem is it's not thick enough to offer the coverage you would want under a white tank ...but it was also too short so it caused a visible line underneath that showed through.that was higher than the bottom of my chest ..so it gave the appearance that i wore the wrong bra/undergarment...it simply looks awkward ...not sure if it would've been better
1 I agree with the other reviewers, this top is completely disappointing in every way, i could not believe it was the same top i pulled from the bag. where to begin,.......it runs really bigit's short and boxy, not at all like it appears on the model, this must be pinned a lot in this picture.colors are completely dull in person, i really think this picture was lightened a great deal.fabric feels cheap and stifflining is stuff and poorly sewn.i haven't one positive thing to say about t
2 I've never spent this much money on a sweater but took the plunge using the retailer day discount. still painful but hopeful it would be worth it. i ordered the xl hoping to compensate for the shorter length. and it fell just below my hip bones so that part was okay. while this looks like the cashmere is on the thinner side, so the garment flows nicely, it's not. the weight of the sweater is substantial, heavier and much thicker than it looks. the color is different too. it's tan and grey, not whi
2 I love the design and fit and quality. have been looking for a long-line top like this and was willing to pay full price. i have that dreadful little roll right under my bust line and this sucks everything in nicely. smooths it all out. i'm a 38c and everything was contained nicely and fit great in the large top. here's my issue - wore it once and the colors ran! i was so excited to wear this i didn't even wash the top (i rinsed and dried the bottom, though). and i'm not a swimmer. just let
2 I ordered the white and the light blue in size xl. both are cut much smaller than is typical for my other retailer xl blouses. everything the first reviewer wrote is true. the photos of the white top show a detailed back when it is plain (like the blue). the back is just a solid, kind of slippery material. it's strange because it's not see-through in the back but you need to wear a tank/cami for the front. so, it makes the shirt that much tighter since you need to have the extra layer. i would
1 This dress will unfortunately be returned...so cute online and looks like a sack in person.  runs very large, arm holes are very low.  not flattering.
2 Note the sleeves on the model. that is how your regular size will fit your arms. however, even if you have skinny arms like i do, the sleeves will be tight. i bought my regular size xs and it was clingy with an odd flair and the length seems as though i ordered a petite and i am only 5 ft 2 in.i advise to try a few sizes on if you really are interested. the red is truly a red which is a good thing because so often it is hard to find a red that is not neon.
2 I did not like the fit of this. as another reviewer stated, it is not a swing tunic. it hangs fairly straight. i don't have large hips. i'm 5'8" and 120 lbs with a full bust and this did not look flattering. i returned it immediately.
1 Totally bummed. the pretty print doesn't outweigh the very odd fit of this dress. makes you look really top heavy and even the print, which looks so cute online, looks muddled in person. sadly, went right back.
1 I was looking for a casual dress for quick errands that was trendy but comfy.  this dress had a lot of potential [i was drawn to the print]  but the material is awful. so thin and scratchy! immediately went back.
1 I tried on and bought this shirt in my usual size and it fit long and loose but still had great shape. after hand washing in cold water and air drying, as per instructions on the tag, the shirt shrunk significantly. so much so that my stomach shows if i raise my arms at all. it also lost its shape, and now looks very boxy and is very unflattering. i won't be wearing it and am disappointed i didn't even get to wear it once!
1 The dress is beautiful in pictures, but all the reviews are dead on...it was full of snags when it arrived! 8 snags to be exact. and the fabric was heavier than i expected. sadly, had to return.
2 I ordered this and thought it would be cute for work, but it tuns out the sleeves are ridiculously long. i am 5 foot 10 and do not have short arms. also it is a bit short waisted for me. i do love the floral detail of the button.
2 Cup size is really small for a medium. no way to adjust the back strap. ended up giving it to my daughter. cute but so poorly executed.
2 The shirt is very soft but it felt very large and unflattering. the back felt bulky and looked awkward. definitely returning.
2 I was so so excited to get this sweater in the mail. unfortunately, the sweater is lined with the same material (very soft and warm btw) as the polka dots, which sheds like crazy. i wore a white tshirt under this for the first time, and my shirt was covered in black fuzz by the end of the day. so much so that i was gathering balls of it to be thrown away. very disappointed. a lint roller can't even clean up the tshirt.in terms of sizing, this fits tts, i normally wear a l or xl, got this in an
2 I thought the dress was ok, but was surprised by the cut away triangles of material right under bra band on the sides of dress. i will send back, also a bit too high waisted for me. other than that, the dress is as it appears.
1 Noticed all the 5 star reviews online for the latest pilcro stets- so due to the past 2 years of dissapointment of what was once a great pair of jeans....i was hopeful that retailerpologist listened and went back to the original pilcro stet formula- thick denim, just the right amount of give and a flattering 10 inch rise. walked right in and found them- and i knew right when i touched them- they were still the thin denim that's nowhere near the quality they once were. consumers pay attention and t
1 The fabric is a little stiff, the back looks unusually long compared to the front, and it fits tight across the chest. and i'm not busty so that's not a factor.
2 This sweater is thick and does cover the bra well. i did not find it to be well made. the ribbing seemed to be attached loosely in places. i am a size large with a b cup and a bit thicker through the middle to my middle age dismay. putting this sweater on in coral made me feel like a giant peach. for those with larger breasts it is likely more flattering.
2 I wanted these culottes to work so much! the fabric is gorgeous, but the size i ordered didn't fit. i'm normally a size 28 in pants, and i ordered a size 8. it was way too tight and made me look like i had a pooch in the zipper area. not what i wanted it to be. had to return them unfortunately.
1 I do not even know where to begin with this product. i ordered a small (i go between small and medium) and felt that would be a good fit. after trying on the shirt, i would have opted for the xxxxxxxxs or whatever the smallest size is. this shirt is very boxy. i know its supposed to have a 'flow' to it, but this shirt is too much. it needs to be taken in. or have a belt wrapped around it. i tried the belt look but it did not look flattering. i found this color to be very blah. overall, i am slig
2 I'm 5'5 and 130lbs and i was swimming in the small. the arms are very boxy, the sleeves too long, and and it just wasn't a flattering fit at all. the color and design on the front are both nice. the sweater is made in china and very, very itchy. i own wool sweaters and wear them with layers, but there was no way this was going to be comfortable. very disappointed, especially given the price, but perhaps that's why there are so many left at the end of the season and on sale. this one is going bac
1 I loved them on when i got them, but they literally frayed apart on my body as i wore them, and i had them on no more than 5 times. it was not a fit issue or a seam issue; they literally just frayed apart in two areas.  while flattering and incredibly comfortable, the fabric was not at all durable...they are not your typical  denim,  they almost kind of a knit feel them.
2 It is a beautiful sweater, but it is cropped and boxy.
2 I bought 3 shirts in gold, black and red. they arrived larger than expected. after the first wash and air dry they shrunk. i would have been thrilled but they shrunk to be shorter while staying too wide. also my black shirt faded a lot with one wash.
1 This is a great dress if you don't want to leave the house or you want the world to see your nipples.
1 I was able to get this on sale. when it arrived, it was missing half of the rhinestones. i am very surprised that this top would be sent out this way. it also was missing the little bag with extra stones. i'm reaching out and wondering if anyone else has experienced this and is there a store that sells rhinestones like the one on the blouse? any help from anyone would be appreciated. i hate to part with this, but where was quality control?
1 This top really is lovely. i had high hopes of it looking smashing with black jeans. i wash everything before i wear it. though this garment says it needs to be dry cleaned, there was nothing so delicate about the fabric that it had to be dry cleaned. so i hand washed it with delicate soap. when the lighter colors came into contact with the black, the black immediately stained the light color. i tried putting some stain remover on the black stains, rinsed and hung it above my bath tub. it is cur
1 Super itchy! had to return.
2 Would be flattering on someone who is slim with all the right curves. i'm average size and a mother of 3. the medium was not a true medium. the fabric was amazing. the arm holes were too open/low cut for my taste. i'm 5'7" and 140. this landed mid calf. not my preference. retailer accepted the return with a hassel free refund all under 2 weeks from receiving it.
2 I'm petite, and i knew buying this that it would be a big sweater - that is the look that is portrayed on the model. the sweater is scratchy, the neck was so big and bulky i had trouble making it lay right. it looks great on the model here, but not on me. going back. so bummed. the color gray is true to what is shown and it has little "holes" or openings across the shoulders. so there is a tiny bit of detail. overall, not a great sweater.
2 I loved this shirt when it first arrived and i couldn't wait to wear it. after one day of wear, i went to hang the shirt back up and it was ripping on both sides of the middle back seem. this shirt was not tight on me at all. very disappointed.
1 I am not sure who would look good in this dress. it is extremely oversized with tons of fabric that will not flatter anyone!
2 I really wanted to love this, but it was just too voluminous to be flattering. i am typically a size 10 or 12 in dresses and jumpsuits, and the medium was billowing around me. also,the elastic waist hit me low and bunched in an unflattering way. it had to go back.
2 There isn't a whole lot that i did like about this dress. the shoulders have large poufs, the fabric isn't very soft, and it's not flattering. maybe with a belt i could be tempted, but i wasn't too fond of the dress.
1 Large and the material is too bulky. i returned it.
2 I loved this top but the cut was too short in the waist for my 5'8" frame. wish it came in a tall size!
1 As another reviewer noted, the upper portion (back, chest, shoulders, etc.) fit nicely. however, the body of the dress was enormous and did, indeed, make me look much heavier throughout the middle. back to the store it goes.
2 The quality and fabric are fabulous but it's just too voluminous for my figure (5'8", 155 lbs), would look great on someone more slender.
2 Gorgeous, but so big. i got eh pxs and it's like a mumu. i wiill return
1 This sweater is a dull off white color. it looks old fashioned. don't get.
2 I wanted to love this dress, but it has too many flaws. first, the "waistband" falls right under the bust and the skirt flares out from there. not a flattering silhouette.. second, the fabric is a sickly yellow-beige netting that looks like burlap. third, i can't imagine what kind of bra you can wear under it. on the plus side, the fabric isn't scratchy.
2 I splurged on this top and was sadly disappointed. i'm a 36d, and the l was so tight i couldn't get it over my chest. also the arms were super tight and the length is nearly cropped.  and the fabric is shiny, the picture makes it look like it's matte. if it did fit like the model i would've loved it. the print is beautiful though. bummer
1 I wore this blazer for one day, didn't do anything strenuous, and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back, next to the center seam. it's completely unfixable, since it's not the seam that split but the fabric itself. what a waste of money.as to the fit, it is a boxy cut through the waist. it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned. the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it, so it's good over something cute.or, it would be, if it didn't fall apart.
1 I really wanted to love the shorts.  when i read that the shorts were lined, i expected them to be lined so that my underwear didn't show.  even though the shorts are lined, you can see through the fabric completely.  this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design; pockets; and, comfortable waistline.  i'm returning the shorts as well.
1 This dress had so much potential. the top was absolutely gorgeous. my issue was with the bottom half of the dress. the bottom is made from a heavy quilted material that is stiff and has no movement at all. the dress is supposed to fit like a modified mermaid dress where its more fitted around the hips and flares out, the dress i received had so much material on the bottom that it actually made my hips look bigger. i though about having the dress altered but decided to return instead.
1 I'm 5 ft 7 125 lbs true size 4 and these pants made me look like i had boy parts. super disappointed!
1 I wanted this dress so much, i ordered it twice. both times the zipper was defective--it would get stuck midway up, at the waistline--so i had to send it back (there isn't an retailer in my area). this is a shame because it's got great colors and looks flattering on, and i was looking forward to pairing it with a cardigan/boots for fall. i even thought about taking it to a seamstress to have the zipper replaced, but the cost didn't seem worth it. too bad, as it seems like it would be a nice
1 This dress looks lovely on the model, but it looks just awful on me!i am 5'4" and curvy. the shoulders are cut w/ a weird shape. instead of a cap sleeve, it is like a pointy cap on the side and stuck out on my shoulders. it looks like i am ready to get beamed into space.the material is nice and the sequins are pretty, but the cut of the dress is unflattering.
2 This tunic only barely resembles the photo in person.first, the color is much less saturated and more orangey than it appears in the photossecond, it's huge. i'm 5'4" and typically wear 2 or 4p in retailerpolgies' shirts/dresses. i ordered the sp and the dress was at least 1.5 times wider than it needed to be. it hung off me completely boxy and shapeless; and the style doesn't really lend itself to use with a belt.
2 I loved this dress before putting it on, but it was just not the right cut or style for my body type. it is very roomy and full and looked like a maternity dress which was not a look i was going for. sadly this will be going back. i loved the print and the feel of the material. just not a flattering cut for me.
2 I love maeve dresses and have always gotten a lot of wear out of them while still looking great. this dress does not meet those standards. on the 2nd wear of this dress the zipper completely broke. i had to take it to a dry cleaner to get replaced at a pricey cost for a pricey dress, i'm dissapointed.
1 I love the colors. however, $200 is a lot to pay for a small piece of fabric , no lining what so ever. the fabric is very thin. you will need a slip. looks just like a cover-up. going back.
2 This top is beautifully made and designed.material is soft and comfortable however it's very boxy. the details on the side stick out.i just found it not very flattering for me.
2 This dress looked great on the hanger, but once on, it did absolutely nothing for me.navy is one of my most flattering colors, but the navy in the dress did not make up for the yucky second color that was so blah it just reminded me of dirt. that second color made me look drab.i am 5'8" with a long torso and wear a size 12 in tts tops and dresses, but the waist on this dress hit at an uncomfortable spot between by waist and ribs. i really needed the waist to be dropped further. or higher
2 I bought these in the mustard color and the salmon color.  i didn't have a problem with general fading, but used natural, mild stain remover (biokleen) and the pants were ruined. one faded where i sprayed and the other has a permanent water mark.  cold wash and line dried. such a bummer that these pants aren't every day wearable and washable!
2 I had really high hopes for this shirt after reading the reviews. first off it runs really small. i usually wear a small or medium ( 4 or 6) i couldn't even get the 6 on. i probably could have even done a 10. the fabric was extremely flimsy. i was almost afraid i was going to rip it taking it off. other than the sizing and the fabric, it just wasn't flattering on me.
2 I'm 5'4, 115 and the xs swallowed me like a snuggie. i suppose the tons of fabric might drape nicely if you're 5'8 and above? it drooped and hung comically large from every angle under arm, body and skirt. a belt was no match for that much fabric. the colors are gorgeous and it appeared well made, but the design was awful.
2 I couldn't wait to get this dress! i bought it and was instantly disappointed when i took it out of the bag. while the fabric was beautiful, the sizing was way off. this dress claims to be 35" long, and i could tell instantly it wasn't. it barely covered my rear. i also know it's supposed to be flowy, but it was really, really wide. i can see this working for someone around 5 feet tall who is wider.
1 This dress looks like it could be cute on but when you put it on its just blah. i saw someone else trying it on in the fitting room and she felt the same. not cute, not flattering, the model photo is deceiving. would not recommend, although it looks airy and comfy.
2 I purchased this shirt in white and black. the white is more ivory-isn, and is a bit thin/see through. the shirts can be worn with jeans, or dressed up with a skirt. i just wish it was a little more form fitting. i do like the hint of stretch in the fabric! very comfortable as well!
2 I'm 5'3" about 130lbs and ordered a size 6. the print on the fabric is as expected but the shape of the dress and fit were not good at all. i probably would wear a 4 instead of the 6, but could tell that even if i had the 4, the cut of it still wouldn't be flattering on me at all. it was baggy in odd places and had no shape. the outer fabric is very sheer and see through and the lining is nice, with a fitted slip design.
1 Luckily i bought this on sale... i now see the instructions online say to hand wash, but i bought mine in the store. the instructions on the tag said to wash delicate in cold water and tumble dry. i washed it in cold water and it shrunk to doll size.
2 I wish this shirt would not have had so much material. it would make a great maternity top! if you are really thin, it might work for you too.
1 These pants are gorgeous when you first see them. they fit beautifully when you first put them on. and then you wear them for one day. and they snag. on everything. and little strings start to come out of the pants. and the hem begins to unravel. and the pants which were once beautiful light summer pants appropriate for work or brunch are now frumpy, worn out pants with a million snags and strings hanging off of them .... after one day. i can't begin to tell you how annoyed i am that i spent
1 I ordered a size smaller prr other reviewers but that still didn't prepare me for the sweater's issues. it looks really cute but the quality is pretty horrendous. i wore it for the first time today and already the sweater is pilling a lot on my back. seriously heartbroken.
2 I absolutely love mother jeans, but i unfortunately had to return these ones. this particular style seemed to run pretty small. too, i always size up in white jeans, and even the size up that i had ordered were just too tight. i typically wear a 28 in mother, and ordered a 29 in these.
2 I wanted to love this dress, it looks beautiful on the model but it isn't the flattering, even on sale i am not sure if it would be worth it, it it runs pretty big.
2 The skirt is comfortable and as pictured. it also ran tts. i'm 5'5" tall and weigh 140 lbs. i had the medium and didn't need to size up to a large. when you put the skirt on a normal body, it looks like you are wearing an easter egg... and not in a good way.
1 This jacket is just too small for me anyway and i am no way big. i am tall and athletic and this thing looked like it had shrunk in the wash. there are so many better fitting other types out there, this went back
2 The dress didn't meet my expectations, specifically the color, the texture, and the cut of the dress. although the dress was very well made, it just wasn't right for me.
1 I am 5 6' and 130 pounds and ordered this in an xs. the sweater is enormous. the material is also scratchy and not soft at all. i'm disappointed with retailer's sizing this year. i've had to return a # of xs items because they are huge. really disappointing.
2 I absolutely loved the patterns and colors of this skirt, if only the cut wasn't so odd. the sides of the skirt "wing out" for a very distracting and unflattering look. the stiff, felt-like quality of the material only makes matters worse. in that respect, the model photos are not at all accurate. it also runs large. i had to go down one full size.
2 This top arrived today, and after trying it on, i wanted to leave a review to say that the shirt is 100% without a doubt pinned back on the model in the product picture. the fit is designed to be loose, so i don't think anyone could possibly get the same look as the model even if they sized down. i've included a picture of how it fits naturally, and a picture of how it fits the model as i hold the fabric back. it's still a cute shirt, just not the flattering top i was expecting. i'm debating on
2 Remember those cable-knot cotton sweaters that were popular in the eighties?! that's exactly what this sweater is. everywhere your body bends like elbows is emphasized by the fact that cotton does not bounce back like other finer fabrics like wool and cashmere. i'll pass on this!
2 Like some other reviewers, i, too, have to comment on the dress's fit. the dress doesn't fit right around the bust or the waist. as a seamstress myself, i know that the problem is that it doesn't have any darts in the bust, and thus the bust and the waist are just about the same size. this dress really just needed a few of these extra hidden details to fit right. while a belt helps, i don't think it helps enough to justify the price. it's too bad--i think the concept of it is cool, and i was rea
2 I bought this shirt after reading so many positive reviews. it looks much thinner and cheaper than the photo depicts.  like many reviewers have said, it does hit just above midriff but the fringe covers your belly.  it didn&#39;t hang right on me and i felt like i was wearing a rug.
1 This is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer, but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear. this brand makes some of the softest, cutest tees, but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry. not worth the cost.
1 I feel in love with this piece. the color are gorgeous and i received so many compliments. it lifted my mood just wearing it! sadly, ut the end of the first wear i had a run up the front and by the middle of the second wear the light fabric got caught on something and a hole developed. upon further inspection i found another hole at the top where the price tag must have been attached. i also noticed all over pilling after the first wear! so sad! they should recreate this in a heavy fabric.
2 These have a very interesting cut. it seems like they were made for someone extremely tall. i'm about 5'5" and the size 4 fit in the waist, but fell way below where they do on the model on the picture. it's hard to imagine who they would look good on, they're also very poofy right below the waist.
2 Loved how this top looked online and couldn't wait to get it. i ordered the xs and it was huge and also very short in length compared to the picture online. i love the fabric and design but the fit was totally off. this is going back!
2 The material is adorable and if it was available in a blouse with sleeves, i would buy in a minute. we have a pool and i thought it would be cute to wear while entertaining. now the cons, i am long waisted and this strange tie knotted high under the bustline giving an odd lumpy look. it runs short and i can't imagine who thought this design was a good idea. there were no reviews when i ordered. i am learning to try it on in the store and/or read the reviews before investing. i would say go up a
1 These run very small!! they are also short, almost like a crop pant. the fit was so weird that i won't even exchange for a bigger size.
1 Very cheap looking material. looks cheap to cost $158.
1 This dress had so much potential. looked cute when i received it. put it on & couldn't wait to take it off. it's shapeless, top heavy & just overall unflattering. the material could be cute....on a totally different dress. don't waste your money.
2 Looks great on the picture but when it arrived it was a great disappointment, both the colors and style. the material seems great quality but it's stiff and scratchy, the style is very boxy, and as another reviewer said, just hung. i'm a brunette and the colors looked terrible on me. back it goes.
2 This bra runs very small, and is hard to get on and off. i think if i went a size up i would be happier.
2 Didn't like at all. itchy fabric, looked good on model but on on busty girl.
2 This looks so cute...but don't be fooled. it is so poofy. it does not look in real life like it does on the model. it poofs way out on the sides and looks ridiculous. i was so disappointed.
2 I put on this t-shirt and my husband said it makes you look old. he was right. i'm not sure if it's the cut or the pattern but i found it completely unflattering on my petite frame and it looked cheap too. perhaps on someone else it would look different. the pattern is overwhelming and the sleeps are a bit too look and ruched for my liking. it may look better on someone taller.
1 It's the inverted invert ... not so obvious at first but then it shrunk and was harder to ingnore.
1 I found that this dress ran very small. i am true 8, ordered a 10 and it was snug
2 I really love the pattern and the look on the model, and i thought i would love it. i ordered online, so i did not try on in store. when i tried it on, it has way too much fabric around the waist and skirt. it is thick fabric as well, and has a lining, and the waist has extra fabric for the design, and it has pockets, so it all adds up to be way too bulky. it is not flattering at all and made me look 10 pounds heavier. i am returning this dress. sad, because it looks so lovely on the model. i am
1 This looked fabulous on the model, of course, and i love sweater dresses. but even in an xs, i was drowning in fabric and looked ludicrous. concept is good but execution went terribly wrong somewhere. a definite return.
1 Ag jeans have been a main stay for me. they are the most comfortable and best looking jeans on my body. however this pair was too tight and shorter then i liked. the fabric and color is beautiful. i wear the same size for ag no matter the design. but this one ran too small. i have to return it. i will try the next size up if they still have them.
1 I ordered this dress in the green color. the dress did not look like the picture. i returned the dress since it looked like something to wear to a farm barnyard dance. i returned the dress.
1 Looked good in pictures. i even ordered an xxs petite and it was huge! although the sweater has interesting textures and is very beautiful, it is very awkward and poor fit. will be sending back.
2 I am 5'3" and the arms of this sweater run at least 2 inches past my finger tips. if the arms were not quite so rediculously long then i would definitely keep it but unless you are tall, it just doesn't work. also, i felt the length of the waste was a little shorter than what is pictured online. sigh.
2 The minute i put this sweater on, i couldn't wait to take it off. it was way too scratchy for me. so, for those with any type of sensitivity to wool, this is not the sweater for you. otherwise, i thought the design was quite cute.
2 The first time i wore it, felt wonderful. had it cleaned and then the back end stated pilling. very disappointed with the price and quality. wish i could return for my money back. sad
2 This was not what i was expecting. at all. i am a medium in just about everything but ordered a large to possibly wear this as a dress instead of a tunic since i am around 5' 4". the large fit like a small on me, and not like a typical oversized sweater type small, but a normal fitted top small. a previous reviewer said it is long and straight, and i think that is a good description for it. i think the models wearing this in the pictures are all wearing an extra-large #or a different cut of the
2 The fabric is too sheer, also looks like sleepwear. just not my thing.
1 Even at a very deep discount, this piece is definitely not worth the money. the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design (which would be cool)--which is largely what attracted me to it, but as i discovered when it arrived, that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo. so this image is rather misleading. the actual jacket is very thin--more like a shirt with an open front than a jacket. the pockets are just loosely tacked inside. for
1 I loved how soft this dress was, as well as versatile. however, i only got to wear it one time because after the first wash, a giant fabric tear happened on one of the seams. unfortunately, the fabric is so soft, but rather thin, and it didn't hold. the care instructions say machine washable but i wouldn't put it in the washing machine again. especially since i often have to wash clothes twice in the washer i use because it's so old and barely agitates. would love this if it was made a little be
2 I loved this top online but it arrived very wrinkled which raised a red flag as to how it would look after wearing it. seemed high maintenance. also, didn't love the fit. color is vibrant but overall not a fan of this top.
2 This is a beautiful top but the xs was literally 4-6 inches too wide. very disappointing! i am thin and tall but this was a maternity top on me. i don't usually wear xxs. it is much more voluminous than it appears in the picture and it is definitely gray and blue not white.
2 I tried on this top and it looked fine until i tried to move. you can't lift your arms. i tried on a larger size but still felt like the movement was limited in the back and arm areas.
1 This top is beautiful in design, but sadly, i will be returning. it is hand wash, and even after doing so, i had 2 unraveled threads resulting in large holes. unfortunate since it was so flattering before washing.
2 Didn't work on this curvy gal.sizing up would have helped with the button gaps, but the flowy shape of the blouse would have looked too maternity on a larger size.major pass.
2 I snapped this up under the 20% off top sale and free shipping because it looks so pretty. i ordered a large because i usually take a large or xl in tops. it is huge! i could have taken a medium if not for the lining -- which is tiny! the lining does not cover the chest and bra area and hits the belly button area while the orange part falls down to the hips. and it looks like a block and makes me look wide. who needs that? like i said, a medium would fit better and would not be so wide, but i fe
2 I was so excited for this dress to arrive, but when it did, it was a major disappointment. there is no lining on the skirt portion of the dress leaving it sheer. also, the top part along the chest puckered in a weird unflattering way. the colors were beautiful, but not enough to to make up for the other design flaws. i am 5'6" 140lb and the small fit tts. will be sending it back
2 What a shame this dress is. i wear xl and am 5'2", but the dress in the store in the size xs(!!!!!) looked just the right size. yup! xs was just the right size. i can't imagine anyone who wears m or s finding this dress fit flattering. it would look like a sack. it is an inch or two too short in the front for me, so i'll be returning it.
2 This dress looked gorgeous, light and lacy in the picture, but when it arrived, the "lace" that appeared gold and black in the photo was more a solid brown pattern against the black which was not attractive. the inner sheath was made of a heavy, sequined material. it was uncomfortable, scratchy and felt like i was searing chain mail. it also added bulk to the dress, so that i looked ten pounds heavier. i can't imagine why they would design this delicate dress with such a heavy inner slip. the si
1 They ripped on the inside upper thighs of both legs less than two months after purchase. i've washed them once, and wear them a few times a week, so they're certainly not worn out. i've never had a pair give out even close to this early. i loved the cut of the jeans and the softness, and they hold their shape well after multiple wearings. the color is lighter than pictured. i paid full price (the most i've ever paid for jeans) because i'd heard good things about jean shop quality. even at sale p
2 I bought this in the blue and really wanted to like it--i had plans to check sizing and then order it again in the red, as well! however, this skirt falls victim to the recent design trend of using a pattern for a structured skirt but substituting a softer fabric and (horrors!) an elastic waistband. this ended up just looking kind of cheap and sweatshirty as a result. back it went.
2 Maybe i shouldn't have sized up to an xl but i'm not sure a smaller size would have solved the weird fit. the vee is quite low and i'm busty. it'll be really low if you're smaller on top. the fit from back to front where it ties looked horrible on me. not tight at all. it's almost balloon like around the hem and from the side view, i looked like a really wide green apple. i hate leaving a bad review because i know someone may love it but i wouldn't recommend it.
1 1. i like a shorter jacket, but this one was poorly made and poorly fit.2. the sleeves were way too tight. i'm a size 10 or 12, and the large which would be a 14 had tight sleeves that wrinkled up my arms, and the hem of the sleeve turned inside out.3. i ordered both a medium (size 10) and a large (size 14) , and neither hung right. the m too tight, and the large too loose in the body and too tight in the sleeves.4. very polyester with lots of static.5. cute idea, but not very good in pe
2 I usually buy xs or s in retailer clothing and the pieces usually fit perfectly. this time i purchased my first petite item because i was worried the length of the pant leg would fall at an unusual spot if i didn't. i'm 5'4 and i ordered a petite small. i was swimming in it. the elastic in the back was so loose you could see directly down my pants. i wanted to love this but unfortunately the size did not work for me.
1 I really wanted to love this dress, but i couldn't. it ran large and heavy. rather than a sleek cocktail dress, it felt more like a heavy sack once i put it on. there was one upside: the drape in the back did not appear to drop quite as low, so finding a bra to wear under the dress might be easier than if it draped as low as it appears in the picture.
1 Agree with other poster. this shirt runs very big. i'm all for a flowy, shirt that hides my belly but this is just a tent. i'll be retuning it.
2 It's thin knit with a unique and pretty neckline, but unfortunately it's scratchy will not last. i just received it and it looks like it would fall apart after a few wears. it's a nice shade of offwhite at least. for me it's a no that will get sent back straight away.
1 I keep trying to find a peplum that works for me, but so far i have been unsuccessful. i just do not think that my shape and the peplum shape play well together?aside from the peplum issue, this shirt had a massive amount of material and runs large. the material alone is thick, making it a bulkier shirt, then add the volume of the peplum and i looked (and felt) huge. needless to say, this one was returned, sale or no sale.
2 This one didn't work for me. there is no zipper, you climb into it from the very large neck hole. it was very low cut and the shoulders kept sliding off but the bottom half fit snug. the tie and waist seam didn't hit at my waist but the largest part of my middle. i tried other belts and it wasn't much better. the fabric and print were great. i love jumpers but this one went back.
2 The fabric and its texture didn't meet my expectations unfortunately. there were too much fray and cast-off of edge yarns of a fabric... however this will fit if you wear over the swimming wears.
1 I wish i had read the reviews prior to purchasing. this skirt looks amazing in photos and lace appears black. the lace on mine is actually purple - at first i thought it was just purple due to lighting with red underneath - but nope - pull the netting away and it is purple. lace netting hikes up on the right due to poor craftsmanship. i ordered a medium and felt it was a bit large. will return.
1 I am almost always an xs in bottoms (sz 0-2) but literally couldn't get the stretchy waistband (no zip or fastening) in xs up my hips. in addition, the "brocade" is a very lightweight polyestery, tinselly weave--does not suggest quality. as others have noted, it also runs short; i'm 5'3'' and this was a little below knee length on me, not ankle-length. i've had luck with retailer's sale section in the past, including some items that didn't always start off with the best reviews, but have no regret
1 Loved the colors but the fit was less to be desired. very wide under arms & too much material. looks more like a maternity dress. i ordered a small petite & would have needed the xs but now it is no longer available. oh well. returning this.
2 This a great skirt for someone with a straight or boyish figure. this skirt does not accommodate a curvy figure - small waist, feminine hips.
2 Pretty color, but i was hoping for a thicker, higher quality material for the price. the material is lightweight and isn't tailored well. looks kind of sloppy.
2 The black band seemed to cut across the widest part of my hips, emphasizing them. the pants are sheer. the fabric was not comfortable against my skin. overall, the pants were a miss.
2 Was super excited to try this on, but had to go up 3 sizes from my normal 6 and the waist was still too tight - i was swimming in the top as well. just a very strange cut and unflattering. such a bummer because it's so pretty.
1 This is a very soft and comfortable jacket but it has holes in the pocket area. it was returned to the store and the other jackets had the same problem although not in the same area. the store was considering pulling the product off their shelves. it is unclear if the holes are just the beginning of a pocket or what. but it was flawed by everyone who looked at it.
1 I'm normally a small in retailer tops. i ordered a small, and the top fit well in the shoulders and in the upper (more fitted) part. it all went horribly wrong from there. the top billowed out at the bottom and fit like a circus tent, instantly adding a good 50 pounds to my frame. this was such a disappointment, as the pattern is beautiful and the fabric is high quality.
1 This dress has pretty colors. the top fit well but the bottom looked like an upside down umbrella. it has enough material to make 2 skirts and the big pockets on the sides make the skirt stick out sideways. the photo of model is from side, not the front. very unflattering on me.
2 Pretty fabric, nice style, took it back.
1 The photo misrepresents how large this sweater is. it is giant! petite ladies stay away from this sweater. i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs, but this just floored me. the neckline wouldn't even stay up on my upper body, it was that loose. also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model. it is like a tent. i'm so bummed. the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft. it's too bad it doesn't fit smaller women.
2 Beware. white is not white. white is more cream, off-white, light beige. i was really looking forward to these shorts but was immediately disappointed when i saw the color. they are cute, but not white. i bought them to wear with the nautical look tops for this summer, but unfortunately, creamy colored shorts don't do much for navy/white tops.also, the button is very difficult to open/close.otherwise they are ok.
2 These run at least 2 sizes smaller than other styles of the same brand, mother. such a bummer because the quality is totally on point. i'm going to exchange them for a huge size i guess. whatever, i don't mind having a size that's so much larger than all my other jeans. i just mind the complete hassle of the exchange process. i wish mother would get their sizing issues under control. it's not retailer's fault. so annoyed.
2 I wanted to like this top, as the fabric was nice and thick, but found that it dipped too low beneath the armpits, which would be ok if your lats are in perfect shape, but i've always found that cut made mine look a bit saggy (and i'm not heavy). not great enough to keep in my opinion.
2 I really wanted to love this dress, but i think the proportions are very weird. i'm 5'7" and usually go for an eight in unstructured dresses and a 10 in more structured dresses.it runs small throughout, and is too short for me to feel comfortable wearing to work. the front is nicely detailed, but the back looks weirdly forgotten and could use more detailing. i tried on three different sizes (8,10,and 12) and they all pulled weirdly at the chest. there's a little slip that goes with the dress, w
1 I made the mistake of ordering without checking the reviews. cute design but not as comfy as it looks. returned immediately.
2 The dress is just ok. i cannot imagine having paid full price for this. i got it for florida vacation. i put it on to wear to church first and spilled a drop of lavender oil on it and it stained!!!! cant get it out. thats punk for a dress that even on sale is like. sending back
2 When i saw this item online, i ordered it right away. loved the color and the oversized, comfy look to it. the pros: very soft,the color a deep cranberry as pictured. the cons; the low back - in the photo, the model's arms cover it up. when i put it on, it looked like an oversized flap that stuck out on the sides and was very visible from the front -- and because the material is unstructured, that made it look worse. i loved it except for this one feature, but because it was so detracting, i had
1 I thought it was only me and immediately assumed i needed to go on a diet when i attempted to put this adorable skirt on. it got stuck at my hips. i'm a very consistent size small in dresses and skirts. i actually thought about putting it on over my head but that was impossible. its going back. now i see the other reviews and am relieved that its the skirt and not me! wish i had read them before purchasing. retailer is going to get a lot of returns on this one.
2 Unless you have the body of the model - tall and very thin and wear a really small size - don't even think about getting this dress! it's literally a heavy sack. it hit right above my knee in the front and basically mid-calf in the back. the material is nice but it's an awful shape!
2 Way too much fabric; sticks out like jodhpurs but from the hip - eek! might be a great dress in rayon or a drapey fabric, but the extra fabric just piles up on itself... the outer layer also doesn't feel like it will breath. add the cotton lining, and i think it will feel miserable in the heat of the texas summer. returning.
2 And hits below my waist just far enough to make my thighs look enormous. i think how it fits depends alot on body type. the material is nice, color pretty, not cheap looking so i will keep it but must wear a topper to slim down thise ugly thighs of mine.....
1 There are darts that are not shown in this picture that make the dress ill fitted. not sure why they are not in the picture and on the dress. i wish the pictures shown were more accurate.
2 I love the color of this top but the style is not flattering. i normally wear a l or xl in retailer clothes and i ordered a l in this and it was massive! i went into the store to try on a medium and it fit much better but is still very bulky around the middle where the ruffles are and it is very wide. bummer
1 I ordered the shirt bc it looked soo cute despite the fact many said this shirt was see thru. it's true.. had to return it
1 I love the idea of this top, but there is just way too much fabric involved in person! i'm 5'2 and usually wear a small or medium to accommodate a fuller chest. i ordered a small and it fit fine around the chest but the huge swing hem combined with the slightly stiff fabric is just enormously unflattering. i feel like they could have made about 3 shirts out of it. i think the picture must have it pinned a ton in the back, the silhouette is nothing like shown. if there were just less fabric, i wo
1 The material that was used to make this top is very thin and poor quality. it feels like the type of material that will disintegrate after one wash. i normally wear an xl and this top is huge and not flattering. returning asap.
2 I was hoping that this would be a nice neutral layering staple but it simply leaves a lot to be desired. it fits tts, length is fine...the inside is some, but the outside darker material is stiff and cheap (kinda canvas feeling?). the material is super stiff which makes it flare out like like a tent in a super unflattering way. it also is on the thinnish side - it looks in the model shot like it would be a little thicker and warm. this is definitely going back.
2 I ordered this dress in a xs petite. i am 5'0" 105 lbs. the plaid looks more drab in person and the fit was very frumpy. the wrap style is typically flattering but on this dress, the dress tied above my natural waist and the fit made my hips appear larger. i was pretty disappointed in this little number and will be sending it back. it might work on taller people, like the model, but i would steer clear if you are a petite.
2 I ordered this style in the blue, red, yellow and white for the sale price. they all fit true to size, matching the model's photos. but, the quality is poor. the hems are frayed, they wrinkle easily, they're just a mess. the model's photos show a messy look so you know what you're getting. the positives are the colors. the blue is especially gorgeous. the yellow is like a spicy mustard shade. they are all comfortable. just sloppy looking. the sale price matches the quality. they do stretch out t
2 These socks were so narrow, especially on top, that they pinched my thighs and we're almost painful to wear all day. my thighs are pretty narrow, i'm only five feet tall and my legs and hips are the thinnest part of my body. i understand that they need to be reinforced on top so that they don't slip down but these are definitely made for a person who is unhealthily skinny. "one size" is definitely not true. they also snag easily.
2 This was so unflattering. the bust was too high so it hit me weird on the boobs. the green was a beautiful, vibrant color but the fabric is so delicate that one wrong move would cause a snag.
1 I had my eye on this dress for months. i came into some extra cash and bought it at full price online and picked it up in the store. the purple pattern is nowhere near as soft as pictures. it was very bright which disappointed me. it's also made for more busty women. at a 34d i could in no way fill this dress out. the result made it look so frumpy and unflattering. i felt like an old lady in a bag.
2 Ugh, i hate that this didn't work! the top shoulder/sleeve portion is so pretty and unique, but the fabric is overall this and cheap feeling, the length is too short for how flowy the shirt is (the sides go way up on me). the fabric feels like something that would fall apart after one wash. back it goes!
1 As much as i buy from retailer, this is my first review. the pictures do not accurately show how large this dress is in person. i wanted something that was a bit flowy, but this was a reminder of little house on the prairie. the most unflattering dress ever and since it's only available online, i'm not interested enough to try a smaller size.
2 I saw this dress online and loved the colors and whimsical embroidery . i thought it would be the perfect dress to wear on the weekend with cute sandals. i was excited when the dress arrived in the mail as the colors were vibrant and the material was soft and cozy. unfortunately this dress is huge. it is a rectangle with pockets. i bought the xxsp, my usual size and this dress was so big my sister was able to fit in it with me.this dress was beyond alterations. too bad it was a great idea but no
1 I bought a pair of these in stone and after the first wash they become all splotchy. i chalked it up to perhaps there was bleach leftover in the my washer. although nothing else in the load was blotchy. i then, because i loved the cut of these pants, bought another pair in the darker blue color. the same thing happened after the first wash. again, nothing else in that wash load was the least bit ruined -- just my new retailer pants! such a bummer-- definitely a dye issue. i called the stores i pur
2 I was so excited to try this sweater on when it arrived but to my disappointment, it was overly large! i was pratically swimming in it. really love the design and the way it looks on the model. just didn't work out that way on me.
1 Bought two of these because i loved the way they fit off of the rack. washed them according to directions and they were ruined. the material shrank up making the shirt short and boxy and the side panels ended up being rippled. definitely going to try to return these.
2 This dress is so pretty, a true cinderella dress, that's why i can't find a reasonable explanation for such an amazing dress to be made out of plastic. i don't understand much about fabrics, but the dress feels like a waterproof camping tent. i bought a size 14, which is what i wear in moulinette souers (i usually go one size up since i find the rib cage small in this brand), the fit was perfect and the cut was very flattering. i will anxiously hope for a remake of this dress with a better fabri
1 Very disappointed. ordered two sizes, the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i wouldn't have worn it and the zipper was sticking. the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked. some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under $100 but at $228 they are not. returning both sizes.
1 I was so looking forward to an awesome maxi dress.  this was not it.  completely see through.  i guess you could wear it as a bathing suit cover up.  but be prepared to knot the length or you will trip.  its an odd design. absolutely not worth the price.  i purchased the sm/md and i could have for two of me in the dress. returned this piece without looking back
2 I love off the shoulder looks and had high hopes for this top. unfortunately the folded top portion doesn't stay down at all. i found myself pulling at it all day and eventually gave up. the material is also not the best.
2 I loved the aesthetic but as a true hourglass shape, i was frustrated that it didn't have a little more give as i tried to pull it over my head. the fabric was stiff, and seemed to be lace over cotton? not entirely sure. i couldn't get past the feeling off the material.
1 I absolutely loved this top. it fit great and was easy to dress up or down. i wore it once and washed it according to the tag. cold water and flat dry. it is now 4 sizes too small and unwearable. extremely disgusted.
2 This is the widest sweater i have ever seen. i laughed out loud when i opened it, and then showed it around my office and everyone else cracked up too. it is comically wide. even when i was 9-1/2 months pregnant, the m/l would have been pretty roomy on me. now that i'm back to about a size 10-12, this looks like jared from subway's pre-weight-loss pants, in sweater form. ridiculous!
2 This is a pretty dress, but the cut is quite boxy. i had thought that the dress would cut in a bit along the body and then "flare out" more around the waist down to the hem; however, the dress is baggy from the sleeves all the way down, which lends to a rather unflattering look.
2 This top did nothing for me. it billowed in the front and was not flattering. for reference, i am 5"4, 115 pounds, and small chested. i ordered the smallest size the top came in (cannot recall if it was an xs or 0). i promptly returned it.
2 This top looked so cute in the picture, but unfortunately doesn't live up to it! the one i received, actually has the print shown in the photo on the inside of the shirt. it makes it much darker, and boring. the shirt itself is on the short side, and would've looked better if it hit lower on the hips, there's just too much fabric for it to land higher than that.
2 This is one of those you can tell from the hanger that it's not going to work. too boxy. too short. and the girlish ruffle makes it look like an over-sized child's shirt that got all messed up in the washing machine.
1 Really wanted to luv this top buttt it ran small in arm length & in the front, bottom...backside was perfect coverage...also most important this top is see-through! item as pictured is not accurate!
2 Good quality fabric and structure but the mix media details and lines make them seem more like jodphurs than leggings. it's hard to see where i would wear them ... sorry but they have to go back.
2 When i saw the dress i loved everything about it except the arms made me a little nervous. i ordered it when it went on sale and it turns it the arms are worse then i thought they would be. they are like my grandmother crochet it and accidentally attached my child's dress arms on my dress.
2 I was so excited to try these but was really disappointed in the fit. i found the legs and butt to be tight but the waist to be really big. if you are normally a size 24, i wouldn't bother with these.
1 I was so excited about this top, and so disappointed when it arrived today. the lace part is lovely, but the skirt part is a crinoline type fabric that balloons out at the sides. it is gathered at the sides rather than pleated, and there is no way to get it to lay flat. the back center section is pleated. why couldn't they have had the pleats all around? this will be going back with much regret.
2 I loved these pants - super soft and cozy and perfect for winter. i've worn them a handful of times and have washed them maybe twice max and they already have 2 holes! they don't say handwash and my washer/dryer is brand new and pretty gentle on my clothes. maybe i just ended up with a bad pair, but i found the quality to be disappointing :(
2 Loved the open shoulders, but not how large and flowy the rest of it was. i could have worn it 9 months preggo ;)
2 I recommend this dress because it is beautiful, stylish and well made even though it did not work for me. i tried the small and extra small. the first - way too big, lengthwise (hit my knees) as well as in the shoulders - the latter to tight across the chest - not for me but worth a try. i am typically a small with usually never have a problem with length.
1 I have been continually disappointed in retailer's clothing for the past year. i feel like their prices have soared and the quality has remained so-so, but dresses like these somehow make the cut. it does not make sense. since when did retailer exclusively market to older women? no, retailer's market has always been young adults. this dress is extremely matronly. although the bottom print is nice, the hot pink belt?? is completely mismatched and gaudy. i really hope retailer starts curating better dress
2 I wish i had read the reviews before purchasing online. i love how this top looks online but when i tried on the small that i ordered, it was comical. so so boxy. literally, shaped like a square. it must be pinned back on this model. maybe if i ordered an xxxxs it would have worked...or perhaps for a larger person, it may look super cute!just didn't work on my slim build. :(
2 I wanted to love this shirt. it's not my usual style buy it looked so great online. unfortunately the actual shirt is much more brown in color and design than i thought looking online. i'm fair coloring & it just wasn't flattering. i'm thin but have a larger chest and this style just wasn't right for me. could definitely be cute on someone else but not a good match for me.
1 This looked like a simple, chic blouse, but the fabric felt cheap to me, like thin lining fabric. the neckline is too deep and wide as well and so not flattering.
2 I never leave reviews for anything but this dress was such a complete miss. first off, it's about 3 sizes too big. second off, it's knitted with a metallic thread that you can't really notice in the picture. i'm usually a medium and feel an xs would be sufficient.
2 I tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger. but it's basically cut for model-sized people only. it's short and wide, and if you have any boobs at all it'll make the back pucker. i can't imagine this will look good on most women.
1 This dress didn't work for me at all. i'm 6ft tall, 160lb, i usually wear size l 8/10, but based on the reviews i ordered an m. the material of this dress is very soft and fuzzy, color is about the same as pictured, also length is appropriate. dress is very thick and warm, the fabric however has no stretch at all, dress is very specious and shapeless. there is allot of room everywhere except shoulders & sleeves, i thought that area was tight & snug which is strange because it runs large everywhe
2 I was worried about this item when i ordered it because of how it looks in the picture, but i had wishful thinking. i should have gone with my gut! this shirt does not have the same quality as all my other retailer purchases. it is see-through and flimsy. the bottom is just like the picture, it hangs in an odd rumpled way. the top is very flattering though, so it's a shame! if the bottom fit nicer like their other products i could have gotten away with wearing a cami under it to make up for the qu
2 The color and quality of this sweater are fantastic. the reason i only gave it two stars is that the height of the neck didn't seem right to me. it looked awkward and too high to be left standing upright, but when folded over i wished it were higher so it formed more of a turtleneck/cowl. i will be returning the sweater because of that.
1 Contrary to the first review, there is a zipper so while it wasn't easy to get on, it did fit over my bust. i found this too small and high waisted, and i already have a high waist so i can imagine it looking empire waisted on a normal torso. what i hated was the ridiculous inverted pleat in the front of the dress which is almost impossible to see in the online photo. it made my already busty frame even wider and more unflattering. the lining was nice and soft and the sleeve length and hemline l
2 This top is absolutely gorgeous, but i followed the care tag to a t and it completely fell apart in the wash. will be returning.
2 Well, i wanted to love it and it was just too much. i think it is a bit wider and weirdly baggier than it should be. i also feel it should be fully lined. it was not. the exterior wool and pattern is very nice. maybe if it was lined, a smaller size would have worked better, but for the price, i needed more. i also would have liked some sort of option for tightening the waist a bit when zipped up. i realize this isn't in the picture, so no expectation, but upon trying it on and seeing its boxines
2 This shirt is thin and shapeless. the quality is h&m esque. unflattering. not a fan
2 I love maeve and was so excited for this top which looked like an update from a last season favorite. unfortunately the fabric was stiff, it was tight in the chest and went straight down from there. returned.
1 The shirt is beautiful, but fits much too small. the stitching limits the space in your shoulders, and the hem too short. a petite frame would be able to pull this off- but i am a 5.10" medium, and the shirt didn't work in every direction.
2 The title says it all. while the quality was good, when i put this dress on a felt like i was wearing a shapeless sack fashioned out of wallpaper. the length was longer than on the model (makes sense since i am only 5'5"), which was ok, but the overall fit was just too big. i am a size 2 and tried the xs, which was huge. just not flattering or breezy or sexy in any way. going back!
1 I wish i had read the other reviews before purchasing this product. label says that you can wash and dry normally. however, upon washing, the outer layer shrunk and the inner lining did not. the robe will now not lay flat; the fabric pulls at the edges, and results in the inner lining being revealed when the robe is tied shut. extremely disappointed. for a $100 garment, i expected much more. i wish i could return this.
2 I ordered this dress online. the colors are pretty (if you like pastels) and the fit is true to size, however, it fits very much like a maternity dress. for those of you rocking a baby bump, this is a good choice. for others who are not, it's just not flattering. my figure got lost in the dress and the high waist did not look good on me. i returned it.
2 These leggings are loose fitting and the quality is just not there.. i am returning the item.
2 Like other reviewers have said, this is very sheer, look at the sleeve in the picture and you'll get an idea of how sheer the body is as well. the material posed challenges for it's creater because one top i tried on in the store had a sleeve that was smaller than the other, tight enough that it would have ripped if i weren't careful. tried on another identical top and the sleeves were a normal somewhat loose fit. bodice portion is much more intense pink in real life. loose, billowy, and perhaps
2 These pants look beautiful when you first see them. it goes downhill from there. the waist is very small in relation to the rest of the pants. it felt fine when pulled up, but it is a struggle. i could get past that, but when i looked in the mirror, i could see right through them. no lining and not very thick material for this price!!! a real bummer, especially since it was a birthday gift.
2 The price is high and i have to dry clean this? no thanks.
2 Bought this shirt on-line. wanted to love it but just couldn't. i ordered the xs and it was huge and way too unstructured for my style....just didn't have enough shape. had to send it back.
2 Mine came smelling like gasoline. not sure why, but i would have kept it otherwise. it's a smell that will be really hard to get out. looks like the picture.
2 I so loved this dress online. not so much in person. first of all it didn't fit my build. i'm 5'4" with a 32f bust and the waist line was just a bit too high to be flattering. mainly i'm returning it because of the fabric. the petticoat netting does rustle as another buyer pointed out. my main fault is that the top fabric is synthetic and cheaply printed. basically it's the lining fabric of a better made dress or coat. if it were cotton voile or silk it would have been beautiful. why they made i
2 I wanted to love this top. perfect weight, length, and shape. unfortunately, the seam goes right through the bust and just does not look right. if you are tiny on top, this will be lovely on you.
2 I was really looking forward to receiving this blouse in the mail. the color was beautiful in person and the photo does not show the nice beading around the neck. that being said, i was so disappointed in the fit. i ordered a size 00 and the arm length was way too long yet the body of the shirt was way too cropped. cropped enough where you could see skin on the sides. made no sense! hoping to order a few more sizes to see if i can find the right fit. order up for length, down for arm length ...
2 I normally wear a medium in retailer dresses, but ordered a small due to the reviews that stated how large this dress is. they weren't exaggerating!!!! the small was way too big for me, and the xxs and xs are already sold out. beware that you will have to size down at least 2 sizes to make the dress fit similar to the model pictured. it is going back for me!
2 Loved the design but jacket looked like 20 years old because of a lot of piling even brand new jacket at store. i wish they use better quality fabric so i would have purchased it.
2 Got this in the sky color. returned it because the top is way too sheer for me, if you know what i mean. i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids. no can do. also, for the price, material just felt flimsy & cheap. it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i'm 5'2", 114#, 34b
2 I was really excited after finding this top online and reading the reviews; the combination of peplum, cap sleeves, and color seemed too good to be true. i ordered a size medium but unfortunately, this top is on the short side so wearing it with pants or jeans did not work out. in addition, the fabric was more sheer than it looks in the picture and the v-neck in front dipped a little lower, too. a camisole might have solved both of those problems but i didn't bother. i returned it to the store.
1 This is the worst shirt i have ever tried on from retailer. it is basically a big shaggy box from the front, and from the side it looks like a tent. it is also short.
1 This is adorable but if it truly has to be dry-cleaned that is deal killer
2 I saw this dress online and really wanted to love it... unfortunately it wasn't at all as expected in person.as the previous reviewer mentioned it is extremely itchy material, which was already pilling on many of the dresses displayed in the store. the neck was extremely tight; a problem i've never encountered with any retailer dress. additionally it seems to have a kangaroo pocket located right underneath the bust line, which protruded in an unflattering way. the pocket is not at all not
1 I couldn't wait to get this top in the mail since they didn't have it at my local retailer, but i was so disappointed in both the quality and fit. the white is completely see-thru, i can't believe how sheer the material is - especially for the price. even as the shirt is lying down, i can see through both layers of it... the fit runs small, and short.
2 I wore this for a few hours, and while it i got compliments i ended up needing to return it after the seams opened up over the shoulder blades. the fabric is so fine that during the normal goings-about of my day it gave way. and no, i didn't buy too small, and the fabric didn't pull while i was driving or reaching for anything.
2 I ordered an xxs petite and this hangs like a bag on me. i'm usually fine with the petite sizing, but this didn't work and i'm so bummed. the dress is soft, the blue color is gorgeous, but it fits like a bag. i wanted to love this, but sadly will have to return. i think someone with curves will love this dress. it is really beautiful quality, just does not fit a petite frame.
2 I love the look of this sweater, but just bought and put on at home and noticed 2 pea sized holes in fabric, near arm holes, but not on seams. not sure if i bought this way and did not notice or if fabric is just incredibly delicate. will try to repair but scated this will not hold up... look it over carefully before you buy, they kind of look like moth holes...
2 Ditto what the first reviewer said, unfortunately. i was so looking forward to receiving this dress but the one received is not the one in the photos. the graphics are fantastic - still love the boats- but the top is not the same and they've added a fabric belt to the finished dress. the fit was perfect except for gapping under the arms (similar, i suspect, to what the first reviewer reported). i was also surprised by the fabric. based on the photos i was expecting something light and semi trans
2 I was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately it's going back because the knit is just too thin. i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but it's not. and because it's so light, the swing effect doesn't really come off. nothing special.
2 Very disappointed that i ordered this dress and a large was too big. returned and asked for an exchange to a size medium, it was apparently not available in the medium, i was charged a 5.95 fee for return shopping. so i immediately went to website, medium available and i had to pay another 12.95 for shipping. seems a bit unreasonable, but really liked the dress.
2 Whatever happened to sizing! pretty print and color but has enough fabric for 2 tops. it is also unlined which is not a huge issue. i wore it with a cami. the arms weren't too gaping for me, thankfully. i tried to make it work with a wide belt but i will have to get it tucked on the sides. i am 140 lbs and got the small. should have gone 1 or even 2 sizes smaller.
2 I bought this online. this looked like a sweater that was accidentally shrunk in the dryer, when i received it.i will be returning this.
2 I wanted to love this sweater. the lavender color and design with the pleated back was beautiful. however when i put it on, it added at least 20 pounds to my frame. unfortunately it's going back since the cut just doesn't work on my frame.
2 I have these shirts in the blue and green and they were great. i'm 5'4" c chest and athletic build - the small shirts fit pretty good and i love the fabric so i kept them. i really wanted these dresses to work but the cut was different even between the gray and burgundy. there was tons of room in the chest, but it was tight in the shoulders. i really wanted to love this, but there's just too many cut issues. it is a good length for work though.
1 I should have read the reviews first before ordering this top/!. ***buyers beware**: you will not get the same top delivered to you, as is shown in this picture. the top i got delivered does not have the little straps at all, and while there is a bow in the back, the back sides do not come together the same to form the bow. i hate to write a bad review, but come on retailer! i'd never expect this from you. it looks like any other peplum white top, not something special like the picture is o
2 The fabric is a nice weight knit and the top generally well made. unfortunately, the fit was enormous. i've an athletic build w/ big boobs & normally wear l in retailer tops.
2 I ordered this blouse because it was such a good price on sale but should have paid closer attention to the reviews. the slits on the sleeves are much more noticeable than in the photo and the blouse just didn't work for me. something about it reminded me of seinfeld's pirate shirt. i appreciate retailer's return policy. i took it back to the store and got an immediate refund on my cc.
2 I ordered an xxs and it is extremely short in length. another customer had a similar review, but i still took a chance that it would fit well. the sides of the shirt have slits, and because the shirt is too short, it shows the skin on my hips. the rest of the shirt fit fairly well, but i'll still need to return this top.
2 Tried this twice in yellow because for the price it seems like it would be such a useful piece, but the quality is below average for an retailer dress. it's just a shapeless, thin, beach cover-up that i could've picked up anywhere. the yellow color is so cute though. if you're looking for a light, breezy, go-to-the-beach dress that you can shove in a bag with your towel, this might be good for you, but it's too thin for just about anything else.
2 The fabric, colors and concept are fabulous but the pleating is overdone is it looks huge not swingy!i am 5' 9" and 135lbs. and even an x-small was too billowy to be cute. too bad- it's otherwise so great!
2 I ordered the in the emerald green and it was sent to me with a dime size hole in the sleeve. i am very disappointed, because i love the sweater. by the time it arrived, it was sold out in my size. now, i cannot exchange it for one that is not damaged. if the sweater was not damaged, i would recommend this product.
1 This reminded me of big bird in person and just adds volume to your body. i'm thin and usually wear a size 0, so i'm not sure who this may look good on.
2 This shirt is not a good look for a gal with hips. the fit at the top is tight (i ordered a small) but there is so much material at the bottom and if you are a little taller (i am 5'7), it hits at a place that is not flattering. i was hoping for something that hung straight down and would be good with leggings. this is not it...also the material is a little stiffer then i was expecting.
2 The wash on these jeans made my hips look twice as big. that in combination with the looser boyfriend cut was not flattering. quality was excellent. denim was thick with the right amount of stretch. unfortunately they had to go back.
2 I tried this dress on at my local store and was very disappointed in the slip portion of this dress. there is no give with the slip so even though the dress portion is quite flowy the slip prevents anyone with a large chest or hips to wear this dress.
2 Very cute top but runs very very big ! im5 ft 5 in tall, 120 lbs. i ordered the xs but it was so big it looked like a maternity top.. sadly returned the top. otherwise the top was made of good quality fabric.
1 I was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for spring/summer. for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses. the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all. the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown. this dress has no shape to it, although probably comfortable, not flattering. i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture, in person.
1 I was very excited to receive this dress because of the cute photo. however, upon arrival i was completely disappointed. the color is much more drab than the photo. the smudged polkadots weren't attractive. there were many little bumps and pulls in the linen. the dress is super heavy. the pleats around the waist did not lay correctly.and it adds 10 pounds to your hips! super sad! i am sending it back.
1 Yikes. there is a whole lot of skirt here. i am 5"4, weigh around 120 lb, and usually wear anywhere between a four and six in retailer clothing, depending on the designer. this skirt balloons out from the waist. on the website it seems to flow more naturally from the waist. i think that the flowers are cute but the material is cheap looking. the skirt is very long- hitting way below mid-calf. there is also tons of material - creating a parachute effect. definitely returning.
2 I ordered this in my usual size small (36b bust, 5'5", around 116 lbs), but the seam around the high waist stuck out and didn't cinch in at the waist at all, rather bubbled out a bit. the tunic "flaps" laid strangely as well, like they were too small almost. the high cut sides were indeed high cut...showing the waistband of my leggings. apparently that is a new style, as i have seen a few other tops like it around, but i question whether slits that high are appropriate for actual wear outside on
2 I agree with all of the reviews. the design and fit are wonderful if you can get it on.! the buttons are a nightmare! whoever made these clesrly sewed the loopholes on the buttons closed with no thought as how to open them or get them off. ridiculous! they need to put a side zipper on this as i will probably check into since i really want to keep it. so so so disappointing
2 Loved this dress online, but my small pettie stature made me looks like an orphan from the prairie.
1 I love the teal color of this t-shirt and the macrame design at the top is beautiful, however, the top is way too large.  i usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops, so i ordered the size s, there is so much fabric below the chest it fits like a maternity top.  i know if i order an xs, i will have the same problem.  below the bust, the top is not flattering and it&amp;#39;s a shame.
1 I really liked this shirt the one time i got to wear it...but when i washed it, according to the directions on the tag, it shrunk! a lot! the sleeves are now too tight, and it is much shorter. thinking about returning it to the store, but in any case, i cannot wear it again.
2 I was so excited for this kimono. i thought the colors would be lovely. i was looking for a unique wrap/vest/kimono. i ordered this online expecting to be dazzled. sadly, i was not. this arrived and fell short on all measures. the colors were flat, the fabric felt cheap and the construction did not scream $108. it felt like something i would find in a college import/head shop. back it went. i ended up buying the silves wrap, which i love.
2 I wanted to love this sweater. the color is gorgeous, the pattern unusual, it is soft and warm, and would have gone with so many things. but the cut is awful. mainly the sleeves are way too big, making me look misshapen and my arms look huge. the body was a bit boxy but that would have been workable if the arms had been normal. too bad.
2 I ordered this vest in xxs, since i am usually an xs and was looking for a bit of a tighter fit on such a loose vest. even then, the vest looked like a large. not only was it incredibly loose - much looser than in looks in the picture - but the arm holes were huge too. it just looked too big, not artfully drapey.
2 I saw this dress worn on the street and thought it was lovely, the perfect work dress. i then found it in the store and my size was already sold out, so i visited another retailer, and another to find it. unfortunately the color blocking on the chest was not very flattering for me, it seemed to overly accentuate it. i am 5'9" a 36 dd size 12.the colors, the fabric are all wonderful. but this dress is not for me.
1 I was so excited to try these, it's hard to find cute bermuda shorts. the legs were so wide. my husband asked if i was wearing his shorts. they don't look that wide in the picture. i am 5'4" and 130 lbs i bought my regular size 28 but the waist was huge i could have sized down one or two sizes. unrolled they came to my knee.
1 On a hot summer 90 degree day the blue ink on the dress stained the dress and my new tory burch bag. i would never have expected that the blue print would bleed all over me and my new dress. great dress and such a wonderful fit...too bad its unwearable now.
2 I ordered online. i sized up one size. it fit perfect. so flattering and so pretty. then i tried to take it off and the zipper stuck...badly. 30 minutes later i was sadly packing it up to ship back. the zipper is that awful.
2 I was so excited to receive this dress. i got a petite 4 as i am 5'2". it was very hard to zip up the side zipper but not impossible. it didn't look good on me. the waist line was a bit too high...maybe a regular would have looked better. also i thought it was a cotton dress but it isn't. also i looked like i was going to a nordic folk festival to do a traditional dance. i had been so excited to receive this but sadly it just didn't work for me and i had to send it back.
2 I was so excited when i purchased this top! it was going to be my go to for running around, as it looked super cute with leggings and boots! the softness alone made me feel like i was wearing my pajamas.....so comfy! that all changed after one washing......it is now pilling and not nearly as soft as before! makes me sad, but it is going back!
1 I wish i had read all the reviews before purchasing. the sweater looked liked everything i would be interested in online. once i pulled it out of the bag, my first thought was how could retailer send me a used, washed and shrunken sweater. it is nothing like the picture. it fits like a midriff top, not exaggerating. i'm 5.6, ordered the m, don't waste your shipping money on this.
2 Loved the design and quality of this suit but the cups seemed huge. i weight 135lbs 5'6" and wear a 34c. i bought a large in this suit because other reviews said it ran small (normally i wear a size medium) i did like how it fit everywhere expect the chest. i'm wondering if the medium will still be too large in the chest and hoping the rest would still fit okay. not sure i want to go through the hassle to exchange and it not fit again! it's so cute otherwise and would be perfect if you have a la
2 I was drawn to this top because of the interesting and detailed straps, which are embroidered with a lovely triangle pattern. however the embroidery takes away any stretchy-ness or give in the cotton and makes the top a beautiful but ill-fitting harness for anyone with any breasts or full-figured lusciousness. the worst part is that the top hem along the top is embroidered and rigid just like the straps, so it feels like you are wearing an uncomfortable strapless top. i wanted to keep this but h
2 Beautiful color and the fabric is very substantial and soft. but, they didn't finish the bottom hem! the dress is lined and the bottom inside has a ribbon sewn in as a type of hem, but the actual edge is just cut and not turned in on itself. because of this the whole bottom had a hundred little fabric frays. the rest of the dress is so polished it just doesn't make sense. also, while the fabric is beautiful my dress had a weird mark on the chest, almost like a water mark. just overall bad attent
2 Pretty design and good quality but the medium was very balloony at the bottom. fit my chest alright (34c) but flared out way too much at the bottom.
2 1.) if you look at the 4th photo of the grey shirt and zoom in you can get an accurate view of the back: this shirt is attached in not one, but two places in the back (in the photos of the black shirt it looks like it is only attached, or "knotted" in one place, and that is not the case). disappointing. ----------2.) unless you want to wear this as an off-the-shoulder shirt with a strapless bra size down. caveat: sizing down will become problematic though for those with large arms as the sle
1 This dress is not flattering. the slip is very small and short and the dress is big and billowy. like the other reviewer said, its more like a tablecloth that you stick your head through. it was really hard to figure out how to cinch in the waist but it didn't help regardless. the length is not accurate either. i would say it's a pretty short dress (mid thigh) but that probably depends on the person. it also makes you look very horizontal. i was really excited about this dress but it's getting r
2 This looks great on the model but when it arrived, i couldn't believe it was the same jacket. it looks a bit like a really loose garbage bag on me and no amount of adjusting drawstrings is going to fix it. i really wanted to like it, but even the xs/s was too baggy. also a bit worried based on other reviews that it isn't actually a rain jacket and wont keep you dry.
2 I'm petite, but even if i weren't, i think this runs very large, isn't form flattering at all, and overall looks dull. it most definitely does not justify the price. material is thin.
1 The fit was not flattering at all, but the worst part was the colors were really dull and not bright as shown in the online photos.
2 I actually had no problem with the neck hole of this shirt, even with the xs size. however, i had a huge issue with the bottom eyelet section. it's so tight! it stretches across my thighs and looks so funny, as the top part is still loose. i tried moving up to a size small and still had this problem. maybe just not for girls with thighs ... very strange fit.
2 I loved the cut of these pants and the button accent on the pockets. however, the material was quite thin and the quality was not great- there were multiple snags along the seams. additionally, at 5'8, 130lbs i was swimming in the size 4. i would have tried sizing down if the quality was better.
2 Tried this on at my local retailer, the red color is pretty but not a "true" red. the fabric has a nice weight to it not the usual thin stuff that retailer seems to offer these days. two big problems though- the top is very low cut and i could see it "opening" up to the world! and the armholes are cut so big and low that you could see the sides of my bra, this is a deal-breaker for me, it can't be fixed.
2 I have a pair of mih jeans that are the only jeans i own that i absolutely love. everything about them. this jumper looked versatile, useful and fun, so i splurged during the 25% off dress sale.my experience with mih is that the sizing runs true, or european, and thus small. i ordered this in a medium and it is gargantuan as well as virtually shapeless. it looked horrible from every angle: front, back and sides. i cannot imagine it having more fit even in a smaller size.the fabric is nice, p
2 I agree that this shirt is boxy and has no shape; it doesn't look at all like it does on the model. i returned it.
2 I had been eyeing this coat for a few weeks after it appeared in the email, and i finally decided to purchase it to treat myself. i was very excited to get it, as it is a beautiful coat online. however, once i received it i was very disappointed. the material is much thinner than i would expect for something that cost $168, and when i went to button it the button slipped right off the thread it was sewn onto the coat with. i checked the other buttons and all of them were loose as well. perso
2 Loved the color and the deshn. but when i put on, did not look right. waist was too short and the arms were long.
2 When i received this dress in the mail, i was thrilled. i loved the color and the style, although a bit too much material but comfortable. when i went to show my husband the dress, his first comment was very sexy. i can see your underwear and your skin!!! i don't understand why no one mentioned this in any of the comments on this dress. when i went into the light i saw that the dress was see through and i sadly had to return it.
2 I ordered this in size xl in ivory. it was a drab, poorly-made, too-small sweater. the knit material wasn't good quality and the overall fit didn't work. i liked the light red color and maybe if that had been in stock, then i would have overlooked the problems. but, there are better ivory retailer cardigans available. this was returned.
2 I got this in a l, and probably i am a m. however, the waist pretty much fit, but the bodice was baggy in a really bizarre way. i don't think a human could actually be shaped a way that would fit properly in this dress. this dress is well suited for a woman with a very large bust, but a small waist.
2 Fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and ordered it right away. however i was sadly disappointed once it arrived. while the cut is cute, the fabric is just all wrong. i was expecting a nice, heavy knit-like material, but this feels and looks really cheap - especially given the price of the dress. sadly it is going back.
1 When i tried these on in the store i was thrilled - they were comfy as yoga pants and  the fit was divine. i thought i had found the perfect jeans and i splurged on them for my birthday. after wearing just two times they are baggy and the knees are totally bagged out, saggy and faded.so disappointing - i want my $180 back!
1 It's sheer, the design /print is casual, but on silk like material. had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it! who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer???
2 I bought this top in two colors--i think it's a really cute, easy top to wear, but the fabric is extremely thin and poor quality. i tucked the front into a pair of shorts and i can already see a small snag forming, which i'm sure will be a hole in no time. two stars only because i really do like the look of the top generally, i just wish it was something that was going to last beyond a couple of wears.
1 I can always count on retailer to sell unique pieces, so when i saw this sweatshirt online, i ordered it right away.  it&#39;s adorable and quirky, however, when i received it in the mail, it reminded me of something my grandma would wear.  the sleeves are puff sleeves and are really long, while the bottom of the sweatshirt hit pretty high on my waist that when i raised my arms my stomach was showing.  if this was a more tailored sweatshirt, i would be keeping it, but sadly it&#39;s going back.
1 Very cute top. i went down a size because for me it was a little large in the back, but that was just my taste. i purchased the denim print.
1 I had to return this blouse because it ended up been too small and super itchy. im kind of busty but medium usually works and this one was super tight across my chest. not comfortable at all and the fabric is kind of a sheer with the sparkly lines in silver.wouldn't recommend it.
2 I didn't realize that there were sequins on the design. they kept poking my shoulders and made the top very uncomfortable. the white material was also not very flattering on me. it went back.
2 So i'm not sure if its just my body type or what, but this did nothing for me. the bottom, which i thought would be too big was actually too small in both the small and the medium (i'm a size 8 bottom) and then when i sized up to the medium it was still too tight and then the top was loose. i just think this one is going to take the right body type. it could look really beautiful on the right person, just not me.
1 Although beautiful colors this eyelet dress is quite heavy and the buttons have no give- one of them literally cracked when i tried to unbutton it. unbuttoning it was difficult due to the tight weave. it just misses the mark and will be going back.
2 In paper crown dresses, i wear a small or size 6, so for this top, i ordered a small. it was huge on me! for reference, i'm 5'7", 130 lbs, 34a. it is very wide towards the bottom, and it flares out way more than in the picture. the material is also a little stiff, so it really sticks out. even if i sized down to the xs, i think the bottom would still look unflattering, so i'm returning this.
2 I would have loved this top if it were the length pictured on the model, but it was a cropped length on me :(
2 I love the way this dress hangs straight down on the model, but on me it looked tacky.  i'm 5'6 and 130 lbs, and this dress hit me in all the wrong places.  i got a size small- sizing up would be huge in the top of the dress (and the arm holes are already dangerously large).  i wish this were just a little bit a-line.  instead, it's literally like someone just extended the length of a t-shirt.
2 I noticed this top on one of the sales associates, and it looked great. she's probably 230lbs and about 5'5.  tried it on and it looked horrible, i even tried sizing down twice. i'm 5'8" and the ruffles started right under my chest. i gave 2 stars bc of the material, it is light, and summery.
2 I just bought this and i really disagree with previous review that it runs big - i wear an 8 in skirts and bought another retailer skirt last week that fits just fine - this one does not even zip up. i might exchange for bigger size, as label is just a number to me and sizes are really inconsistent - or it may just go back.
1 I wanted this so badly, to wear as a dress over a slip. but it is not cute or flattering when you put it on. it made me look 20 pounds heavier than i am, and the fit was awful. i usually wear an xs in dresses at retailer and this swallowed me. i am petite but this is just waaaaaay too big. so disappointed because it's so pretty.
2 I saw online, great quality sweater dress- reviews about seemingly extra fabric- easy fix with a seamstress. i have very sensitive skin and wear long sleeves under sweaters. wool, angora, mohair! 5'1, xsp, tts (length/arms) but lots of extra fabric for width. just trying it on was too itchy for me.
2 As soon as i pulled these pants from their packaging, i feel in love with them. the fabric was so soft - i could not wait to get them on...yeah, that was not going to happen! i could not pull them on - not even a little bit! these pants run incredibly small. i ordered them twice: once in my regular size, and again in a larger size. unfortunately, i am sized out of these beauties.
1 As the other reviewer stated the dress is not lined and the fabric feels very cheap. i tried the sp as well and felt i could have gone down to the xsp. i like the style and coloring but given the price and lack of quality this is going back.
2 I ordered this online and was disappointed when it arrived. it didn't look quite like it does in the photos online. it also runs small. i returned it because i did not feel it was worth the high price.
2 I was attracted to the feminine design of the dress, the silhouette, the flouncy skirt; however, i ordered the red motif pattern and hated the splotchy, dark colors.
2 Not as cute as photos, and too small in chest. i am 5'5'', 125 lbs, and the small was too tight in the chest, and i am not large here at all. shoulders and sleeve length fit well. will return. not comfortable, and will need to be able to button it on rainy days.
2 Pretty design, but when i tried it on, the fabric was thin and delicate. i don't think it would last long with much wear. too bad. if the fabric were sturdier, it'd be great as the cut is flattering and i love the pockets.
2 I wanted to love this jumpsuit. it looks adorable in the product photo. i am 5'5" about 120lbs and thus was overwhelming on me. i tried everything--- pulling up the tie at the waist to create a higher line, wearing a variety of heel heights----i couldn't seem to make it work. there was just so much fabric on me! it felt like i was wearing pajamas (and not in a cute 'wear your pajamas out' way). i love the idea and the photo appears to have an adorable line and cut. on me, this jumpsuit was just
2 This material is a nice quality but the shirt is boxy and shapeless. it was not flattering at all on my shape. i don't think it would look nice on anyone with an hourglass shape or fuller chest.
1 The fit on this is so strange. the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift. the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price. the cups are padded, which is nice i suppose, but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i'm guessing. i'm a 32dd, size 8 in pants, and size 4/6 in dresses and i ordered a medium. i also have a long torso, which probably didn't help.
2 Like most people here, i wanted this beautiful dress to fit. so, i decided to see for myself if maybe, just maybe the negative reviews were wrong. they weren't. if you have any sort of breasts at all, the top probably won't fit properly. i imagine a narrow upper torso, like a 32 or 33, possibly a 34 might find the top part of the dress closes properly, but with a 36 c, i could not get a size 12 to button up. the waist hit at a strange spot, and despite the picture showing a narrow waist and grad
1 After reading the reviews i sized down to a 6. once i received it, i loved the fabric and color, however it was so ill-fitting. it's like the designer didn't even use female measurements and used a box to make this top--too wide. i liked it so much that i sized way down to a 0 and it still fit horribly. it is too wide and not long enough. both are going back!
2 I bought this top in black. it is high quality material and i love the mock neck and zipper in back.  however, not only are the armholes are too large, the shirt is cut too short. if i size down for smaller armholes, it becomes a crop top, not a flattering look for 50-something me. i really wanted this to work, but alas, it went back.
2 I love the shirt and it runs true to size everywhere but the arm holes. i bought a size small and the length was great, the fit was great, but the arm holes were gappy and big. i had to return it and was bummed because i loved it otherwise.
2 I was really excited about this top since i have others from retailer that are similar in styling. unfortunately, it just didn't work out. i am petite with a short torso and ordered my usual size and it was way too short in the front. the top was also boxy and didn't sit right. it just wasn't flattering. cute top on the hanger, but just not on me.
2 This shirt is way too flowy and the pink color is extremely washed out- will definitely be returning!
2 This runs super big and it just wasn't flattering--way too much fabric. i wanted to love this dress.
2 I'm upset. i ordered the grey sweatshirt and while the description says the sweatshirt has a zipper, the picture of the grey does not have a zipper. i prefer no zipper, so when it arrived in the mail with a zipper, i was disappointed. it's going back. why have a model where an item that you're not offering???
2 This dress is very cute and well made. unfortunately it was too short waisted for me and runs small in the bust. the arm holes were too big yet the bust small, very weird fit on me. i am six feet tall with 38c bust, maybe if you are shorter with smaller chest this dress will work for you. it has a thin lining and is not see through even though it is white fabric. i love the dress it just wasn't made for my tall figure.
2 The turqoise color is pretty, however, it did smell bad out of the package. i wore it once and it transferred the dye to my skin and white pants, bra and cami! hope it all comes out in the wash. i tried to hand wash the shirt and now have blue hands and a blue tub.
2 The color of the sweater is beautiful, but the fit was awful. it was too "swingy" and made me look like i gained 10lbs instantly, (i'm 5'1", 108lbs). i will be unfortunately returning this item.
1 I saw the photo of the young woman wearing this dress in the reviews and she looked beautiful, i on the other hand looked awful. the fabric of the entire dress is quite stiff, so the dress didn't move with me; it sort of felt as if i was wearing a paper cut out. then to contribute to the volume, the sleeve is not set in, it is a raglan style, that on me looked more like a bat suit, than what i was hoping for, a beautiful distinctive dress for an important affair. also the belt didn't enhance the
2 Looked really cute on the hanger, so i took it with me into the dressing room. the fabric is super soft, and the top is very flattering however the bottom is way too short! you can't tell from the picture but the sides are rounded and go up higher on your leg. the model has the waist band pulled lower than i think you'd most likely be wearing it making the outfit appear longer. i wish i could pull this off...maybe i'm just too old for it.
2 The material was thin, showed every lump you'd rather hide and clung to the body. even the sleeves were tight. looked inexpensive.
2 Ladies this top shrinks!!! i am very disappointed, i was in love with this top and the first time i washed it it shrunk a significant amount. i did not use a dryer, i laid this piece out to dry as i do with the majority of my knit tops and it shrunk. it is a lot shorter and much tighter, especially in my arms. if you love this top i might suggest buying a size up and washing it to fit.
2 Review title says almost all. add to that that it is age appropriate, unlike other kedia dresses, for the very young. just too cute for words. i have all of the other tk peasant dresses and although youthful they are appropriate for anyone young of heart. this however, on an older woman, looks ridiculous. i would have liked it for those 9 months but even then it would cover quadruplets!
2 I ordered a small, which is my usual retailer size, but this was like a tent on me. it's fine if you like things super super blousey but that wasn't what i was looking for. also it is very long, a very weird amount of long. also there is only eyelet on the front. the whole back of the shirt is just plain fabric. i like the idea of this shirt but all in all it was very disappointing.
1 This blouse is a disappointment . fabric is cheap looking and the cut is very off. just odd. sleeves awkward . the back of the white shirt on the on-line model is not the same as the white shirt i received. mine was plain in the back like the blue shirt on line even though my shirt was white. no ruffle. returned.
1 The top looks better on the model than in-person. it fits loose and looks boxy and matronly. i don't like the sleeve length or the top style, it just didn't look flattering or good. i am sending it back. looks very boxy.
1 I ordered the ivory of this dress, expecting it to be a nice dress i could wear into my second trimester of pregnancy. instead, i received a dress that looks like a ugly, vintage-gone-wrong curtain of fabric. the 'ivory' is the color of yellowed newspapers. the fabric was cheap and had thread pieces sticking up all over the place. i would've been better off sewing myself a dress out of drapes a la gone with the wind or sound of music. the fit isn't that great, either. big and boxy. it could acco
1 I am floored by all of the positive comments about these culottes! i can see that they would work for someone who is rail thin and has no hips... but for those of us with curves (i'm a size 12, hourglass), these are very unflattering. they made me look like i was carrying an extra 20-30 pounds, just around the hips! so bummed because they look so cute on the model.
2 Sadly, going back. ordered m, light color option, very difficult to pull over my head, not a good sign. got it on and neckline looked attractive (height w/o being a mock turtle), but whole thing a bit small around middle. could order the l, but i'm not liking the feeling of the fabric, it feels tight with restrictive and nonuniform stretch: 33 cotton/27 poly/27 acrylic and 95 rayon/5 spandex "contrast", which must mean the stripes. combine w/fact that the two wide stripes are right at my middle
2 Quality jumpsuit but poor design. the green made me look a bit like "gumby the cartoon character"
1 This is a beautiful kimono but just isn't made well. the one i received already had a couple small holes and a pull in the thread that was very noticeable. after reading the additional reviewer who wore it an hour and it was already pilling, it is going back for good. such a shame!
2 These pants are more like 9" not 10". i was very dissappointed. the color is great and so is the fabric.if you look more closely at the model the pants don't fit her either!! they are too small! i haven't decided whether or not to take them back because i am losing weight. i am a 31 so far but these pants are like a 30. i need the color because they go perfectly with a top i bought from retailer
1 I thought this dress would be a cute beach cover up so i was excited to order it but i was very disappointed. i am 5'7 and i usually wear a size small top and 4 dress so i ordered a small in this dress but it was huge!! i understand that it is not meant to be form fitting and i wasn't expecting it to be but when i tried this on i felt like i was wearing a potato sack. i feel like an extra small would have been just as bad. i was so upset. it also has thin silver lines through it which, for me, m
2 I'm very disappointed in the quality. it seems more like a pajama than a tunic. definitely not worth 100.00 dollars. i plan to return it.
2 On me, thsi was ginormous, looked like a mu mu. it is pretty, but there was just too much fabric, even in the smallest size. the quality seems nice, and it looks pretty, but overwhelming. i will say, i think it would work on tail lean people, i have pretty muscular shoulders, so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look 30 pounds heavier, no joke. fabric is soft though. give it a try, just not for me...ref: 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist.
2 This is such a beautiful dress.  but have to return for the reasons others have noted.  the chest does not fit well.
1 This dress really was huge, and not at all flattering. i don't know how they got it to look good on the model in the picture. material was nice and soft, but i really don't see how anyone could look good in this, no matter what your body shape is.
2 This is much prettier online than on me. too much dress, even though i sized down.
2 Loved loved loved the shirt but...the material was so thin
2 I wanted to love this sweater but the fit is just awkward. it is very short and box and ends up being very short in the back. i am going to return this item.
2 I love tracy reese dresses, but this one is not for the very petite. i am just under 5 feet tall and usually wear a 0p in this brand. this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress. the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame. not a stranger to alterations, shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment. i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me. i returned this dress.
1 I so wanted to love this suit. it was gorgeous - the color, the quality, the style, but i am returning and can not recommend it. the sides need to be connected just a little bit higher and i think it would work, but there is no way you could move around in this without things popping out in front. i mean it would be gorgeous to just lay there in the sun, but i didn't feel like i could even walk safely, and i am not well-endowed. very bummed but it's going back.
1 These are horrible pants!!! they run small in the thigh and butt like other cartonnier crops. look great at first....after a few hours of wear the stretch out everywhere!!! absolutely terrible! i have several pairs of cartonnier crops that are my "go to" pants, but these are not worth even the sale price! i'd give them no stars if i could!! this fabric is very different from my other printed pairs. if u must try them, size down and suffer through the first few "tight" hours! trust me...they will
2 Very beautiful colors unfortunately the cut is much too tent- like and it looks like a maternity top on me. i like a flowy bohemian top but this one was too much for my tastes, sadly i sent it back.
2 I really wanted to love this shirt! the colors are gorgeous, very vibrant and just as shown. the fit was all wrong on me. i ordered the petite xxs and it was still too boxy. and, it kept shifting so the front collar of the shirt would ride up into my neck. it looked like a sack on me. for reference- i am 5'2", 112lbs...with a small frame.
1 I was really disappointed when i tried this top on. the design and cut of the neckline is very bulky and just off. the cut of the top overall was just off.
2 So much right but then....too short.
1 Too tight in strange ways. beautiful dress i was so excited to receive it, however it just did not fit.
2 I ordered these in m (5'8" 140 lbs.) and they are tts: they fit well and are neither tight nor loose. the issue that i have with them (and the reason that i sent them back) is that the material, although comfortable, is completely transparent; if i were to try to run out to get the mail in these, the whole neighborhood would essentially see me bottomless! furthermore, these are not white but off-white (and quite a yellowy off-white, at that), so these loungers don't look as cute with the feature
2 I love the way these jeans look and fit, but they have a chemical smell. i assumed the odor would go away after i washed them, but it doesn't seem to have helped.
2 I wanted this sweater to work but sadly it failed. first, the pink was way to sheer for my liking. the sheerness caused a weird color overlap on the stomach area. then the band at the bottom was too tight causing a weird ballooning affect. a shirt underneath could work but it takes away from the beauty of the knit. the soft pink is gorgeous but not good for medium to light skinned folks.
2 I was so excited to order this sweater. i thought that the moss color would make it a great basic for work or casual days. ordering it on sale made it all the better. however, when it came i was so sad to see how muted the colors were, with little definition. the sweater itself lacks definition as well, just shapeless and hangy. i also did not expect the angora like hair on the sweater which bothered by eyes as soon as i tried it on.
2 I loved this dress. it fit perfectly everywhere except for the sleeves. the dress has an overall relaxed fit, but the sleeves were way too tight. i had to send back because of sleeves.
2 I have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive. this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat. the sleeves are very wide (although long). as a light weight fall coat the sleeves don't need to be as wide because you wouldn't be layerng too much underneath. the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit. i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh
2 Unlike the other two reviews , i found this dress horrid. i ordered a xs since i am between that and a s. it was just too much fabric for me. . i have a small frame, so it was just so overwhelming, the armholes were big and i felt like i had a bag on me. colors were nice and fabric was soft and light.. the belt made no sense as others have said. length was good. i tried it on as soon as i got it and couldn't take it off fast enough. i literally ran to the post office and back it goes. this is my
2 I wanted to love this dress! the material is beautiful! but sadly i agree with other reviewer. the model definitely has this pinned back! i am on the small side (5'5", 120 lbs, straight figure, very tiny "girls") and this dress looked awful. totally swallowed what little shape i have and the swing did make me look prego in front and back. the fabric is stiff so i think that adds to the sticking out oddly. as far as sizing the arm jokes fit great. xs ordered and length was good but wish the "swin
1 I saw this sweater on-line and loved it until i tried it on. i'm 5-7, flat chested, 135 pounds and i ordered a size small. the sweater fit everywhere except for my arms. this sweater will work great if you are short. consider making your sweaters a little longer, because i do not consider myself tall.
2 I ordered this online, and when i opened the package, i was impressed with the quality of the material and stitching for this top. it is much nicer than a basic t-shirt.when i tried this on, the band of stitching that was supposed to go beneath my chest was sitting on top of my cleavage! also, the overall length is listed as 27" long, but i think that is the back of the shirt. the front of the shirt is very short on me (i'm 5'10"), hitting well above my hip bones.if only this was much, m
1 I'm a petite so as usual i have to order from retailer. i saw this on line and tried it on in a regular size in the store. even though of course it didnt fit, the style of the tee was nice so i ordered it. i couldnt have been more disappointed when i received it. the quality was truly awful. i'm not even sure why it is being sold. the neckline was warped and wouldn't lie flat again the neck or chest; the bottom hem was crooked. it was really bad. also having purchased tees in similar material befo
1 I tried this shirt in a small (my usual retailer size) and it was very unflattering.   the fabric was ultra soft and it seemed it was nicely made.  however, this shirt is so unstructured and oversized, i might as well worn a brown paper bag.
2 After the second wash, the stitching in the armpits completely fell apart. after sewing it back up, wearing it, and washing it a third time, the stitching in the other armpit completely fell apart as well. not sure if this was just a fluke, but it was very disappointing. now that both armpits are sewn and all other stitches are intact, i must say that this is a great dress. i would have returned the dress to retailer, but i've already washed and worn it, so again...very disappointing. i would say
1 The tops looks fitted on the model because she pressed her arms against the clothes. to my surprise,the tops actually is very very very r o o m y below the chest area.the appliques/laces on the front are made of low quality materials.
1 I bought the black and gray fleece lined leggings. i thought the price was great. too good to be true. you get what you pay for. once i opened the box they smelled awful. it was a chemical smell. i washed the black pair twice and it was a little better. i have washed the gray 5 times and it still smells.
1 The back of the shirt has a tag stitched in with red thread that goes through to the outside of the shirt. it is very visible and looks terrible - especially since the back is the focal point of the shirt. do not recommend
1 And the bottom looks like a tutu. first, i have high tolerance for scratchy fabric but this one i could feel it even through long sleeves. there is no way i could wear something that makes my skin itch so badly. second, the peplum part is huge and looks like an exaggerated skirt. finally, the color on the "green one" is darker than in the picture and it does have more of a green than blue tint. back it goes.
2 I waited a long time to get this top. unfortunately i will be returning. the sides are gathered and stick out a lot on the sides. not as pictured. the sides should have been pleated. it runs smaller in the bust and when closed it was a little snug. afraid this might shrink with dry cleaning or washing. the design is unique and wish this top would of worked.
1 Ugh, the fit of this dress is terrible :/ what a beautiful dress though -- the material and the colors -- had so much potential. but, the fit is awful -- i ordered by regular size and the top was more or less ok, if not a tad big, but hip down was crazy tight that i couldn't even zip it without a ton of effort. i don't think sizing up will help because then the top will be even bigger. disappointing.
1 I loved this dress online and was luckily able to locate it in a store about an hour away from me. i drove to the store to purchase it; however, when i tried it on, i was so disappointed! the print is adorable and it is made of great quality, but the swing style is definitely more than mini! i could have fit 3 of myself in this dress. it is definitely not as depicted in the photographs. also, the background of the dress is way more pink than appears in the photos, and the floral print isn't as r
2 I really wanted to love this dress. i bought it for a photoshoot that will be outdoors, and thought that the green color would be perfect. it is well made, but the fabric is lighter than expected. the biggest issues was the size. i am 5'7" and typically a size ten. i ordered the ten and it fit like a 14-16. it was huge. if you order this, i would say size down two sizes.
1 The title says it all....this fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design. the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials (shoulder is a knit, sweater-like navy fabric) is interesting. however, that is where the positive comments end on this one. the top is so scratchy,, stiff, and, frankly, uncomfortable. i cannot imagine wanting to wear it. it could benefit from a lining, and that might have solved the problem of scratchy, itchy fabric.the stiff fabric of the bo
2 This top could've been one of my favorites ever. i ordered the rose option and was planning on ordering another color. the fabric is super thin but i was able to wear w/o an extra tank. unfortunately after 2 wears, several small holes appeared around the neck/under the ruffle. i washed this top on hand wash cycle and hung to dry. when i came to read the reviews, i noticed i wasn't the only customer with this issue.
2 I was expecting a lot more, but this was disappointing. the material is thin and the quality isn't great. it also hung loose, just too loose, as it runs very very large i returned it
2 Based on the other reviews, i sized down from my usual 6p to a 2p, but this dress was still ridiculously huge and extremely unflattering. i could tell the minute i took it out of the package it wouldn't work. i can't imagine this would flatter very many people. the front photo of the model is incredibly deceptive. very disappointed--this will be going back for sure.
2 It's like a work of art, but sadly, not flattering on me. i absolutely loved the look, and even considered taking it to a tailor, but the material overall is very stiff. if you're teeny tiny and need something to give you the illusion of hips, you might love it. very sad to return this.
2 I was so excited that retailer finally had some bermuda shorts for those of us that are 1) older and don't want to show off that much leg anymore, and 2) are "curvy on the bottom" and really cannot wear the shorter shorts. i ordered these immediately in the navy. i usually wear a 31 in pilcro jeans, and like the other reviewer observed as well, i was floating in these - not only in the waist but everywhere. the legs are big - but it's supposed to be a boyfriend cut so i get that, but they just are
1 Similar to others here, these pants were ruined after one wash. the first pair i bought simply faded after one wash, which was okay, but the second pair got weird splotches on the backside. i'd rather not call attention to that particular area of my body;) could've been a great addition to my wardrobe if they were better quality.
2 This tunic looks awesome in the picture. however, it is made of an uncomfortable sweater-like material not left of centers normal skin cotton. i was disappointed once i saw this in person. not a great material for summer.
1 Too much material everywhere. i am 122lbs 5'4" and i ordered an xs as usual. i was overwhelmed in a blanket of knitted material of muted colors. nice green slip, though. i will return it asap. this is super-ugly.
1 First problem-i would not have ordered this at all had the description been correct. the fabric description is cotton which the dress is most certainly not. secondly, it has a really funky, cheap, unfinished, raw-hemmed slip which is simply not fitting for the dress. the keyhole in the front is super long-again, does not seem to fit the dress. i am not happy with this piece at all but it did fit tts. length is just above knee. i am 5'5" 142 lbs 34d and the six was a good fit. sending this home t
2 I wish i had read the other review about the color of the pink version of this sweater before i ordered it. she was absolutely right - the color is completely different in person. it is this garish pink and brown that looks like it was knit together with remaindered yarn. it's too bad, because the cut of the sweater is cute and the zipper adds a funky touch. maybe the blue is better in person...
2 I was a huge fan of these lovely swing dresses from last year and bought all 3 colors. when i saw this new one, i was thrilled and ordered it immediately. what a disappointment! why did isabella sinclair mess with a good thing? the fabric is a very loose weave sort of "homespun" look, which wouldn't be a deal breaker, but i could see it would be very vulnerable to snags. last year's styles had a removable light knit full slip that allowed the airy fabrics to move. this version is fully lined. yo
2 This sweater is very long, could be worn as a dress at 5'3 !
1 I was looking for a really warm, but stylish coat that i could wear when the weather is frigid as it sometimes gets here in the dc area. i tried on a size small, which is my usual coat size. while the coat fit, it was not flattering. for reference i am 5'9" 128 pounds and usually wear a small/xsmall in retailer tops. in this coat i looked like a linebacker with pads on. the front material is doubled, which makes you look like you have a large protruding stomach. the shoulders are bulky and
2 What is going on with maeve sizing this season? in the past two months, i've purchased two maeve dresses that run very small--particularly at the waist.  having many maeve items from past seasons and other recent retailer purchases, it's impossible to ignore that maeve's sizing is quite off. that aside, the vibrant summer colors and material quality are great. the skirt is lined but billowy and fuller than ideal. strangely, it's a lot of dress yet not enough at the same time. there bodice h
2 While i thought it looked really pretty on the hanger, when i tried it on it just felt like a mess. perhaps it suits other personalities and bodies. i hated that the zipper was in the front; i personally find it tacky and gawdy. while the patterns are pretty, the material felt like some weird fabric wallpaper and i didn't see how the price was justified with how the material felt cheap to me.
2 I'm assuming the model showing the sweater is at least 5'9", it is slightly cropped on her , but it certainly doesn't look super cropped. i'm 5'4" and its super cropped on me. even with high waist jeans.also, it is incredibly itchy. i even tried it with a cami under but the itchy wool came right through the cami.too bad, its a cute design, just needs some tweaking.
2 I love the idea of this top, but wish there wasn't so much fabric. i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.
1 This is more of an undershirt than a shirt. the material is very very thin and it shows everything. it was beyond unflattering on me. don't buy this unless you have a knockout thin body.
1 Bummed out.. this is super cheaply made and very expensive... the design is different , the color is beautiful, but the material is a different story.. it should be priced at the most 30 bucks.. not 128.. i'm returning them. also, they run very big..!
1 This is a rare review for me, i usually love my retailer purchases, even at times when other reviewers aren't fans, but this top is terrible. 5'4" 103, 32 b for reference, small frame, athletic, bought the xs in black. the length could have been longer, but i could have lived with the length. the arm hole area, however, a different story. because it's boxy, and the fabric is stiffer bc of the large flowers, the top sticks out on the sides under the arm holes leaving a gape, it did not fit snuggly
2 This dress has a beautiful fabric, i really hated to send it back. it was just so unflattering, absolutely no shape to it. i bought a 0p, i'm 5'5" and 117lbs and it looked like a maternity dress on me.
2 Even in my usual petite small size, this looked bulky and made me look stumpy. disappointing because the style looks so good in the picture and the material looks to be good quality. i don't even know if going down a size would have helped. as others have mentioned it looks like a frumpy house robe.
2 I love the colors of this dress, and i waited for the sale since it isn't really good for work. i wear size 6 in hd all the time, but this one doesn't fit at all on the top. the bust is cut for someone really curvy, but the bottom is for someone really straight. i don't know what they were using for a model, but this has to be tried on before purchased. the material is also rough, and there is no lining to protect you from that. i love my hd dresses for style and functionality, but this one is j
2 I wanted to love this kimono...it is such a beautiful color and would work well with so many things in my wardrobe, but alas it went back due to the strange feel of the fabric...not a soft touch and because it runs small. i bought the m/l and usually wear a 12/14 but i couldn't bring the kimono together in the front (for a belting option).
1 Just a ginormous, shapeless shirt. runs extremely large. i am normally a medium to large in shirts and the medium was huge. i can only imagine an xs would work and i am no xtra small!
1 Not a pretty blouse - it's quite utilitarian in design - and it runs enormous.
2 I had been waiting for this skirt to go on sale as i fell in love with the style and print on the website. however, after receiving it in the mail i was disappointed to find that the cut was all wrong for my body type. i am 5'6", size 4, hourglass/athletic. the xs was too big and made me look like i had no shape. would be cute on a girl with no hips/booty but unflattering on hourglass figure.
1 This sweater was so itchy i immediately was turned off. it looks cute in pictures but another problem was that the knitting in the shoulders looks like a kid made it. it was uneven and stretched out. it looked like it was not well made to me. it also shed so much that just from me trying it on my pants were covered in orange fuzz. i returned this one.
1 Sadly, this has to go back. i am 5'5", 128 lbs and this shirt is super short on me. very short. and it's so wide it's almost a trapeze cut. the overall effect is 50s/60s style maternity shirt. which is disappointing because the fabric is beautiful, the detail is nice in person, even the sleeve cuffs are great. i am not very tall and i'm fairly thin on top so i can get away with a lot of styles, loose and tight. the combo of short and trapeze is just unflattering.
2 First off, this runs very large. i'm normally an 8 and sized down to the 6 but probably could have done a 4. it looked like a tent on me. the top part is lovely, i just think the bottom is way to large and not flattering. this one is definitely going back especially with all the white dress options they have out now.
2 The design and quality were great. i really wanted them to fit but they ran large. i'm 5'4 and 120 lbs and orderd the small. unfortunately the fit seemed off as well and i won't be trying a size down. the waist and hips were huge but the thigh area was fitted enough that a smaller size would have been awkward. sadly these went back.
1 I got fooled by this dress's description. it's 100% polyester and not wool as it claims to be! looks cheap.returned it!
2 I'm 140 at 5' 8". pear shape. the pockets really opened up when i put them on and didn't lay flat. loose on leg opening - which i liked. but the pockets sticking out around the hip area made my pear shape even wider. i got a medium
1 After reading the previous review, i was pretty confident in ordering this dress. it arrived in the mail today, and i was so disappointed. first of all, it's huge. the medium was way too big on me, and i'm never a small at retailer! (i even considered ordering the large in this - my normal size at retailer.) second, the colors are not as vibrant as in the photo, and the fabric felt cheap. finally, it just looked like i went to hawaii and bought a drab dress there that didn't fit right.
2 This dress hit my waist in a weird spot and was too short. i would not have felt comfortable bending over. it was a tad too full which wasn't flattering either.i really wanted to love it bc they design is adorable.i need to return it!!
2 I thought it was going to be so pretty. it is ugly on. the macrame is thick, stiff and rough. the top fits awkward on top where the macrame is and the rest is shapeless. yuk!
2 I tried this shirt in the purple motif, it fit true to size, my normal small worked well. all was good on the front turned around to admire the slight detail of the neckline in the back and all i could see with the red thread the designer used to sew their tag in. really? on a white shirt? it annoyed me so much i didn't buy the shirt.
1 The pleats on the bib make this look like something from chloe sevigny's wardrobe on the set of big love. and the shoulders are cut for an offensive lineman.
2 I disliked this dress. it didn't fall on me the way it falls on the model pictured. i think it would work well for tall, thin women with a smaller chest. i am petite with a larger chest, and it accentuated my chest in an unflattering way and managed to make me look frumpy at the same time. not recommended for petite women.
2 The dresss is much shorter than described. very see thru, though guess you can tell from picture. expected more for the price.
1 Granted that i am not as reed thin, or as young, as the model. but i am tall and reasonably slender. i have long hands and small wrists, which would be a factor in the overall effect of this garment. this poncho looked like some sad old stretched out who-knows-what that you'd keep in the car for emergency purposes, in case you needed warmth if the car broke down in a snowstorm -- and i have one of those foldable reflective blankets in the glove box for that purpose. i was looking for a statement
1 Looks great in the picture but when i got this in the mail the fabric was so stiff! shaking it out did nothing-almost like it was dipped in drying glue. i got this for $10 which is so cheap and i still returned it!
2 This wasn't for me. i have a short neck and am 5.3". the length was fine on the one i tried on, but other proportions were off. it was too big around, in the middle, yet tighter at the bottom. on me, this made it resemble a large bag. the neckline stood up on mine. even when i pushed it down to resemble the picture here with the model, it still felt like a whiplash collar (coming up over my chin). i gave it four stars for quality since the material is so soft.
