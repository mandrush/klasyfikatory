1 Really unattractive shirt. nothing good i can say about it. horrible fit. i can't imagine this would look good on anyone.
3 I wanted so badly for this dress to work on me. the design is amazing. the detail is so pretty and delicate. its my version of the perfect little black dress! however i have very big arms...and while i could have easily sized down for the body of the dress, the arms and chest in my normal size did not fit at all. i'm usually a 14-16 in dresses. i tried the 16 and it just didn't work. the arms were way too tight. however i've seen this dress on many other women with smaller arms than me, and they
3 The dress fits me like a tent and i looked pregnant. maybe this style isn't for me and i even sized down. otherwise the quality was lovely with an embroidered area on the top and the fabric style mixing was great and very trendy. it didn't work for me for the right person this is a very well made dress.
3 Nice quality and feel to the fabric but they are super lightweight and do not come down to the ankle. they fall at a strange place on the calf - a better cropped summer pant, perhaps.
3 Pretty disappointed in this sweater. should have sized down because it's quite wide. i also didn't like the stair step. the back clung to my rear. not attractive. the colors seemed to be striking online but in reality are not. returning mine.
1 This sweater is the perfect sweater except for one thing.....it sheds everywhere. i can simply pick up the sweater and shake it in one hand and 40 large pieces of lint go everywhere on the ground and on you. if you like dark jeans- don't purchase. before i walked out of the store- the salesperson had to use a delineator on me- it was hysterical. sheds so much
1 This sweater was not as featured in the picture. the front is completely cropped while the back is regular length. the front barely reached the middle of my stomach. also, the color was not as vibrant as shown in the picture. this sweater will be going back.
1 This blouse has too much drapey fabric and it's just not flattering.  in the front part of the blouse the fabric is relatively short, but the sleeves have so much excess fabric it almost looks like a clown suit.  sending back.
1 I wanted to love this dress because the fabric is fun, but i could not find a way to make the drawstring waist look like anything but a potato sack.the model has her hands hiding the lack of a waistline
3 Delaine blazer so many little details with a slight bit of ruggedness. loved the unmatched buttons, checkered back and fraying that gave this piece personality making it appear less stuffy. easyily dress it up or down, that being said it seems to run true to size except the arms and shoulders were very tight. i would consider going up a size if more of an athletic build. ordered a 4 but i think a 6 would have been perfect!
3 This is a very pretty jacket. light weight and perfect for spring/fall. i had ordered it online as it was not in my retailer store. i did end up returning it though. it does run large, i am usually a l/xl and based on previous reviews i did size down and get the l. the pockets for me were a little big an pushed out having an unflattering look! i was sad to have to send this one back! i was hoping to love it! someone smaller might love it!!
1 I am petite (5'). even the xsmall petite looked sloppy on me. i also disliked the nude fabric under the lace- it made it look cheap. i wanted this to be the perfect lbd, i  just couldn't make it work on my body.
3 This top is pretty and i did not find it sheer at all but i am returning it due to the lace sleeves are tight. but, i do have large arms! other than the sleeves i would keep it!
3 I wanted to love this jacket. so soft and great color. unfortunately it is just too light weight. it is almost like shirt fabric. nice heft to the fabric though. nice length - accept the sleeves were short on me. i am 5'10 and 135lbs. the small was the right size. i was looking for something slightly warmer to layer.
3 I like this top, but it does not fit me correctly. i am 5'1", and have a larger bust, 34 c. this shirt fits in the length, but is tight in the bust. i would have to buy this in a medium. i normally wear an xs or s. the quality is better than most t shirts, and i ordered the red. the red is a deep and striking color, and one of the better reds i've seen this season. the biggest problem i had was the cut of the shirt. the top cuts in and doesn't provide coverage, my bras are not covered by this to
1 There's a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views. it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse. the print is lovely but the fit is very odd. it's pulls at and is very tight through the bust too. i wear medium or large and ordered size large. if you're less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you. but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide. returned.
1 I really wanted to like this dress. the color is perfect, the design and cut are cut (not always the case at retailer). however, the fabric quality was terrible - a shiny acrylic with cheap nylon lace. it looked like something from a discount store and had to go back.
3 I love boiled wool and have gotten a few items from retailer in years past that i have loved. this one was a fail. i typically wear a small and it was slightly too big and shapeless for me. i am 34c, 127#. the moment i put it on, it felt like i was wearing a bathrobe. it flares quite a bit, and the stitching is brown and not dark grey like i was hoping. the quality is as expected. the color overall is as it looks online. but it was a return.
3 I loved this dress...until i washed it. the label says machine wash cold and lay flat to dry...which i did (washed on delicate). now it's not the same dress. it's too short and not as soft and i feel so much differently about it. i wish the label would just instruct to dry clean, i would pay the extra expense to still have the dress i loved. just kind of annoyed. so it's an awesome dress, just be prepared to dry clean it or risk shrinkage if you wash it.
3 Beautiful fabric and beautifully made, but the pockets ruin it... and i love pockets. you cannot see from the photos, but they protrude from the sides a few inches beyond the skirt, and look strange and unflattering, especially from the back. they are unfortunately placed right below the hips, and the effect is like those french bicycle baskets, "panniers." if they were smaller and in the front, the dress would work. i am usually a size 4 and both the 2 and the 4 fit me well ? not too snug or to
3 This dress has so much potential but doesn't make it.i read all the reviews and very few were favorable and still took my chances. fabric color and textures is great but the design is really off.with the little folds on the shoulder and since the fabric is more on the thick side, all this make it to accumulate the "extra" weight on the front of the body and as result "not flattering" for the majority of ladies including meit is a shame since it has may great features, the style: flowy, low
3 I am 5 8", 130 and i usually wear a 4 in tops like this from retailer but the fit of this one was not good for me. though the styling and details of the top are lovely, it was small through the shoulders and very large everywhere else. looked too much like maternity. i love the shape of this kind of top but to be flattering it actually needs to be fitted through the bust and upper body and then flare in the right places and this was pretty boxy all around. too bad - so cute!
3 This silk skirt was not the best look for me, but may work for others. i purchased the med, which fit fine. i just wasn't in love with the print/colors. the skirt has quality material and is well made. it's very light and airy. i did return it.
3 The fabric and style on this swing tee are really nice but be aware it runs really, really large. i downsized on my order because of the style but it wasn't enough. like wearing a tent. i would recommend it but know its very full. i did return it.
1 This dress was a disappointment. not black, but brown. and it was very oddly made, with a weird, seam right across the belly. on its way back...
3 I need t-shirts, these seem cute. a small runs loose, but it's comfortable and it does fit. i am turned off by the little side slits on all of this brand's printed tees. if i want to do a partial tuck to give myself a waist, because these shirts are cut generously, the little slits just throw the whole look off. i tried a few in the store, but left them all there.
1 Cute and very soft, but the elastic wasn't sewn in right. i took them out of the wash and the waistband was a twisted mess. disappointing for more expensive loungewear.
3 I tried this on in the store in the xs size. the pattern is striking and really makes you think of all the things you love about fall. having said that i did not buy it and probably won't unless i find it on the sale rack later. it is really more of a poncho than a sweater. the fit is very oversize through the body and i tried the xs size. it is also fairly cropped on me as i am tall. i would only wear it with a shirt underneath. the sleeves and not attached to the shoulder, but start further do
3 I have a few pairs of the stevie ankle, so i thought i try these. they have very little stretch and feel tight in the waist. the distressing near the front pockets is really apparent...like white stripes. they make the jean look overall cheap. not worth $198, in my opinion.
1 I ordered the taupe version of this tee, which was a medium brown with black stripes. the fabric felt itchy and rough, and was pretty sheer for not being light colored. i didn't care for the fit, which was extremely boxy and wide; from the picture, i expected an a-line fit, but not a wide drop with webbed underarms. i ordered 2 sizes, and could have worn the smaller if i'd kept this tee. it runs on the larger side. what astounded me most was that both tees i ordered were sewn with completely cro
3 These are absolutely beautiful pants. soft and wearable right away, but the other reviewer is right. if you are average or short, these will be way too long. they won't even look like cropped pants, just regular wide leg jeans. i am keeping them b/c i love the look and i will also have them altered to be shorter. it's disappointing that these were designed for the statuesque instead of the other 90% of us, especially considering the amazingly high price for a pair of jeans. so... i guess i am di
1 I ordered this in both an extra small and a small... i found that there was a very big difference in the two sizes- the extra small was true to size and had a great width, but was shorter in length than i would've liked (if it shrunk at all, it would've been unwearable). the small was quite a jump in size and was a little wider than i liked, but i decided to keep that one. the top was very cute and comfortable when i wore it, however i just washed it once on delicate in cold water and when i
1 Material is strange. triangle top is funky. this is just not awesome in any way.
3 This is absolutely huge.  it felt like it was at least 2 sizes too big - the empire waist wasn't even semi- fit.  36d chest and size small was like a tent.  however, the embroidery was beautiful
3 This is indeed a very flattering dress and looks great - unless you move in it. the fabric shows every little lump and bump on your body as you move and clings to tights (only a little but just enough to make it annoying). if you have any jiggle at all, i'd steer clear. would have definitely kept it if the fabric were different because the cut is amazing but alas.
1 Loved the look, fit and styling of this turtleneck. but dry clean only, you have to be kidding?
3 I had tried this on in the beige & loved it but could not find it in my size so i got it in the pink.did not look at good as the beige.
3 I looked like i was going to work on a farm. well made, but seemed fit big. i like and have owned wide leg pants/capris, these were cartoonishly wide.needless to say, they were returned.
3 I like the colors, material and style of this sweater but not a fan of the sizing.  the xs/s was far too short for me and the m/l was great in length but had a tremendous amount of extra volume.  i am 5'/6" size 8.
3 Cute stripes and soft, but very pajama top like in feel/look... like if you wear it out, people will assume you've got the matching bottoms stuck under your pillow at home.
3 The colors on this top are beautiful, even more vibrant than the online picture. i was so excited to try it on. the problem is with the fitting. it's too short and too loose. you can see in the picture that the shirt isn't even tucked in and it barely hits the hips. as much as i wanted it to work, back it goes.
3 I carefully read the reviews and decided to order a medium since that size works for me generally with floaty styles. the neck was a bit small but once over my head it fit and looked nice. the deal breaker for me is the huge droopy armholes that showed half my bra. the colors are deeper than shown. but the pattern and length overwhelmed my shape feeling a lot like a maternity top. i liked that the sides are shorter but overall it's just not my style. better suited i think for taller, slimmer bod
3 I really wanted this swimsuit to work and it looks really nice in person and good quality as well, but sadly the top is cut really strangely. in the photo shown of the model, it looks like a v-neck that kinda gives your boobs a little push to the middle for some slight cleavage. however, that's not how it fit for me. the cups have removable padding on this suit, and when left in, my boobs didn't even fit in the thing and it just looked really awkward in general. and with the padding taken out, m
3 I kept this top, only because i needed a plain black tank, but there is nothing special about it. i found it a bit large and thin cheap material.
1 I was interested in this sweater because i actually thought it was a tunic. the sweater is much shorter than i thought. i wish i could return it. i bought a size large which is my normal size.
3 I ordered this sweater in green, and it was a lovely soft color. the style of the sweater was nice -- really deep side splits made it feel trendy. the sweater is a great length, nice fabric and the side splits are appealing. however, it was just so, so big that i couldn't pull it off -- i just swam in it. i am 5'8" and 118 lbs, fairly wiry?.even the xs didn't work for me. perhaps it would look more suitable on a curvier woman. i even considered having it tailored, since i've had a hard time find
3 It was way to heavy and big for someone with a petite frame like me.i really liked the design and thought since it came in petite, i'd try it.it would probably be better on someone much taller but the material is still too heavy.
3 Purchased this should in the blue motif in size small. i am usually between a small and medium in shirts, 36c broad shoulders. the fit was fine in the small. however, i had a few issues with the top: 1) the blue motif looked actually like a faded blue (as if it had been washed quite a few times and looked worn), 2) the front mid/bottom section laid strangely and gave me a maternity look, and 3) the back has alot of fabric (see back of tank in white motif) and was very voluminous. for me, it wasn
3 Love the detail of the white with yellow underneath but agree with the other reviewer that the material is very thin in the back. also, it is a flowly top so you will need to size down. however, because of the shape it will fit snuggly around the chest/arms. this didn't work for me as it accentuated my normal body type (as in not the model type). i am not overweight but it definitely didn't flatter my chest area. seems like the top worked for others so i suggest trying on first.
1 This dress was very boxy and unflattering. i really wanted to like it because the blue and white details were so pretty but it had to go back.
1 These are light and airy and pretty. they also tore the third time i wore them and not on a seam - a little above the knee while i was lying in my bed.they also do not slim the figure and the fabric is slightly see-through as it is so thin, therefore if you are looking for serious lounge pants - great - i would not leave the house in them... or turn over in bed in them.when i sit, the slits fall down around my thighs. my son complimented my dress the other day because the slits give way
1 I had hoped this bulky knit would be cuddly and soft, with suri (a type of alpaca) in the title. i don't know if the blend (45% polyamide, 25% royal baby alpaca, 20% fine merino) threw it, but had i felt this in store, i would never have even picked it up. unimpressed.
3 I thought this top was adorable in the store and online. it just didn't work for me. although it fit, it flares out too much in the front and just wasn't flattering on me. i am 5' 5" and 128 lbs. and ordered the small.
1 I bought this shirt in a l, since i didn't want it to be too fitted and was concerned a m would be. it is so boxy! it's like a completely different shirt. i have no idea how it looks good on anyone, unless it is simply widened the larger the size. maybe a m wouldn't be as wide and therefore as boxy, but this shirt is just a bad mess. returning.
1 I love the idea of this top and ordered it in white. it is a great design and proportion is nice with jeans. the front is off white t shirt material with a pocket and the back is a light grey heathered panel. i am returning it as it is very thin and the quality is cheap looking. if the grade of material had been a bit thicker and better made, then it would have been a winner!
3 I instantly fell in love with the graphic pattern on this drapey layering piece, and i've received compliments every time i have worn it. however i seriously considered returning it because the way the garment is cut causes it to bunch awkwardly at the sides. maybe it's still just too big--even though medium or large is my size in tops, the medium in this sweater clearly looks baggier on me than it does on the model in the photo, for instance. it is definitely not slimming, but the striking patt
1 Horrible fit not true to size again aline outside of the dress and a very tight camisole underneath
1 I thought it would be heavier than it is. it's thin and more delicate than what i would expect for a winter sweater (it contains wool so not really suitable for spring/summer). it's also shorter than it appears on the model and a little wider/boxier too.
3 It's a t-shirt. a very cute print, nice cut, very soft--but a t-shirt. therefore, why is it almost $50???? tried it on in the store and loved it, but i just can't justify $50 for a t-shirt.for those who will not be deterred by the price: i normally wear about an 8-10 dress size at retailer, and the medium fit well.
3 Gorgeous in every way except its length and how it hangs at the bottom. i prefer a shirt i can wear tucked in or out. this one will work well tucked in but not out so i am returning disappointed it was so well done in other particulars.
3 I bought this shirt in 3 colors. soft, comfortable fabric, as other reviewers have mentioned, and nice detailed sleeve. i am gravely disappointed in the fabric quality since after wearing this one time with a necklace (as shown in the picture) it developed tiny pulls. i should mention that it was a very plain necklace, nothing sharp, pointy etc. i will most likely return all 3 shirts.
3 Material is nice. design would be so great if it didn't fit so large! i am 5'4" 118lbs, athletic build. the dress could be belted i think (a very slim girl at retailer did this), but it is not worth $158 in my opinion. if on sale i might keep it due to the hastle of returning it, however, it is not "flowy." it fits okay in the shoulders, almost too loose, and the rest looks like a potato sack. so disappointed!!
3 This is a very cute designed shirt but it fits very boxy and runs large
1 This top doesn't at all fit like it does on the model. the mid section is very wide and boxy and the material is thick and almost sweatshirt-like. i typically wear size small or 4, but perhaps an xs might've fit or looked better. sadly i must return this shirt.
3 I ordered this blouse as a gift for my mom. it is too pricey to live up to my expectations. it is quite sheer and the hem of the sleeves are unfinished which you can't see in the pictures. this makes a very expensive blouse look cheap. it is made of viscose and dry clean only. the material used is not on par with the price in my opinion. if it had been real silk or another natural fiber, ok. but for me this and the unfinished hem along with the price is a deal breaker for me.
1 Really well made. beautiful. sadly it is very short. not a tunic at all.
3 I guess i am in a comfort clothing mood these days since i have been looking at a lot of them lately! this one is a nice thicker material and i like that the sleeves go all the way down, but i am not a fan of the design. i felt the color scheme was very plain. the neckline comes up higher on me than i would have expected and makes me feel like i am choking. it is not a flattering cut on me and does not accentuate anything i would want it to, nor does it hide imperfections. it truly is comfort we
3 The design of these is adorable with the lace up ties however they are a dingy looking off white color. they are also pretty see through. returned.
1 I loved the look of this dress online, so i was excited to order it, but when it arrived i found it was not at all how i expected it to be. i thought the material would be more lacy, but it seemed pretty cheap. there was also some boning at the waist which is nice in theory, but it made the material poof out just under the waist, making me look like i had a belly. no matter what i did i could not get it to lay flat. returned to the store and bought the embroidered perennial dress instead, which
3 Two strikes against this top, and its going back. first, the white top is a light weight cotton... and it does not come with a lining or shell underneath. just know you will need one. i would have been able to get over that fact, since i have tanks i could have worn, but second strike is that it wrinkles. alot. it came out of the shipping box with the type of wrinkles that i know will get way worse after washing. i am not interested in ironing anything. for this price, i wouldn't have expected b
3 I loved almost everything about this skirt. thick and lined and love the buttons. comfortable. the only problem was that the two sides flared out at the bottom, presumably from the buttons. i was torn, but in the end it just looked too silly and it was sent back.
1 The small, zipped and laid flat, measures 16" across at the bottom of the armholes, 11" at the waist and 18" from shoulder seam to bottom edge. it's too small for a size 0, and not by just a little! too bad, because it really is very pretty.
3 I love the relaxed flattering fit of these pants but the navy die runs..a lot. the first time i washed them t did so per instructions on the label. i did my next load of laundry and everything turned blue/ grey! i tried washing them again with vinegar to set the color and hopefully that will help. lots of color running still though, so to be safe wash and then run washer with nothing in it to clean it before doing more laundry. i'm keeping them because i like the pants, but wanted to let you kno
3 The fit was fine, but the fabric (the beige option) was bland. it washed me out. granted, i'm fair skinned, but it reminded me of sour milk. it's getting returned.
3 I'm 5'9" and these run true to size for the fit but having long legs by the end of the day they start to sag down in the crotch and hit me about mid calf straight out is the package. they wash up perfectly and are cozy. if you're of average height these will probably be your favorite.
3 Okay, so this top has its redeeming qualities, i promise! which is why i gave it 3 stars when i really wanted to give it two. but it's just not worth 2 because i'm sure it works for some people and the quality is just impeccable. for people who purchase this, it will last forever. it's sturdy cotton, not thin like many retailer tee materials. the lace detail and texture is on point and the neckline is very nice. it's a great looking top. my issue though, wasn't with the bust as other reviewers hav
3 This dress didn't work for me for several reasons, but i knew i wouldn't keep it as soon as i saw the ribbing on the neck and arms, which makes an otherwise flexibly styled dress (dress up/dress down) into super casual only (plus it looks cheap). it is also not for the long waisted or tall.on the plus side, the fabric feels great, and it hangs well.
3 This top is beautiful in color and fabric. unfortunately just didn't work in the breast line. gapped and there was just nothing i could do to make it hang correctly. i'm not really large in the chest area (38b) but the large just didn't work. had to send it back.
1 So disappointed. i love retailer! this was a huge disappointment. i am 5'3" and 120 pounds. when i put it on, all i could think was that i looked just like a clown due to the big cowl neck and how large and round the dress made me look. if i wasn't so disappointed, i might have laughed. this had to have been a design mistake. i've truly never seen something so unflattering.
1 I ordered this skirt because it looked cute and versatile. when it arrived the pleat in front (shown in the center) was far to the right so the overall look was crooked. not sure if it was a quality control issue or if that's the true design but it will have to go back. too bad because i had high hopes!
3 Well - i was disappointed in the fabric for this dress. it is a heavier material and i suspect will not be very cool / comfortable during warmer weather when i would normally wear a sleeveless dress.on the upside - the pattern is really pretty.
3 I was so excited when this dress went on sale.  it is very soft and the print is so distinctive.  it is super comfy but not slimming or flattering at all.  i am a curvy girl,  wear a medium 8/10 and this made me look so wide!  the skirt is quit full,  a small would have fit but the top was tight.  so disappointing.
1 Bought this shirt on sale. it was super cute in the dressing room, and for the first time i wore it. washed it per the instructions (wash delicate with cold water, lay flat to dry) and it shrunk so much i don't think i'm going to be able to wear it anymore. it was oversized and loose when i bought it, so it shrunk a lot. there is also a small hole all of the sudden, that i have no idea where it came from (wasn't there when i put it in the washer). very disappointed.
3 This was the dress i was most excited about in the new arrivals, but sadly it didn't live up to expectations. unlike the first two product photos, the dress is baggy and empire waisted, and the black trim is the thin one shown in the last two product photos. the dress is slip on with no zipper or tie, and on me there were about 4+ inches to spare at the waist. all in all it felt sloppy, such a shame as i would have loved the original design online.anyhow, i wanted to share photos of the real
3 The quality of the fabric is soft and thick and well made. loved everything about it but if you are ample in the chest, it is snug and does not hang and drape as well like on the model, so you may want to size up. i am sending it back as the fit is not flattering on me for the price. someone with a boyish no-curve figure would look dynamite in it!
3 I really wanted to love this. i kept refreshing the page so that i could order it as soon as my size was in stock. i love the colors and struggle to find cute dresses in natural fabrics for the summer. unfortunately as another reviewer mentioned the cut of the arm holes is strange. it cut my off in the most unflattering spot.
3 These leggings were way longer and darker then appeared on model. they also were see through or beige color when stretched across hip.especially for the high cost, there are much better althleisure leggings on the market.
3 I'm 5'2", weigh 120 lb.. i ordered p6 and found the torso too short. if i bent forward or kneeled down that fabric would ride ride up into my butt big time. the top was a little loose too. i'm 35ab cup. i love the colors and geometric design. sadly i have to return.
3 Runs really big. i usually wear small and this was falling off my shoulders. very comfortable and soft material. also looks brighter in pic than in person.
3 I was looking for a shirt of this style. i thought it was very cute, but it is not "red' as advertised. it is really a brick orange-y color, which is definitely not what i wanted. very disappointed. sent it right back.
1 I loved the design and look to this shirt, but it ran way big for me. i loved the forgiving fit, but it just wasn't flattering at all. i even went down one size and it still was huge. sad to send this one back.
1 The top i received was large, really long in length, pockets in the front along the seam, and lots of volume in the back without any princess seams to give it shape. the id #'s matched, but that's about it. returned!
3 I tried this blouse on in the store and chose not to purchase it. i did not think the fabric or design warranted the price point as it felt a bit cheap and there's not much to the design. it is true to size - my usual size 4 fit well enough. i'm on the tall side with an average bust and i did not find it short. my friend was shopping with me and she thought it looked maternity on her as she is thin but very well endowed. she also thought it made her shoulders look broad. personally i liked it on
3 I loved these pants.they are so comfortable. however, after just wearing them twice, the threads of the leaves are fraying, and leaving lint on whatever i sit on. the leaves at the seat of the pants are now slowly disappearing. this after wearing twice to work! i imagine after a few more wears that the leaves at the seat of the pants will be close to gone, or at least much less "white" with threads then the rest of the places. this is super unfortunate and will be returning. too bad, they were l
3 I was so excited to try this on--but this was a big nope for me unfortunately. i ordered both an xs and s (i normally wear a s), both hung horribly on me, they were just too big. i love a boxy, oversized silhouette but this sadly didn't flatter me in the least.
3 The shade of orange was quite muddy and not vibrant like photos show. it's going back .
3 This top may be right for some, but it did not work for me. i've been looking for a nice black top and loved the flutter sleeves on this one. however, it didn't do much to flatter my body. i ordered the xl, but it was huge. i'm not sure a l would have solved my problems if it had been available. i found it looked boxy and and agree that the arm holes are too big. the quality is great and style so pretty, though. i wish it had worked for me!
3 This top has gorgeous embroidery, very very nice, looks good in both wine and grey. it runs large. i kept it around not sure whether i should keep it. i usually wear xl, i ordered l and it still was loose at the bottom but fitted at the top. i have a big bust, and the embroidery ended at the top of my bust making the entire look unflattering, because the bust juts out in a strange way below the embroidery. the arms also tend to look wider due to the style. i don't like the fit at all.
3 I am a true to size 4 and when this bathing suit arrived it looks like it's a kids 4. i will exchange for an 8 and hope for the best. the quality looks great and the styling is beautiful but i could barely get into the suit.
3 I read the reviews and everyone loved them so ordered them online. for me, they are a no. i thought the fabric was cheap and the quality not so great compared to typical retailer items.
3 Super large and a very weird cut.  the sides were much shorter than the front and back and this just looked awful on me.
3 I love this top and the beading is beautiful, but just like everyone else, it was way too large. i normally wear a lg, but the large looks and feels like a 3xl. beautiful but large
3 This dress caught my eye online and i had to have it. when it arrived it was still just as pretty as i remembered. beautiful, vibrant colors and a unique oversized floral on a flirty, swishy fabric. unfortunately the cut was really strange. after reading several reviews i went with an xs, but i'm not sure a s would have solved all the fit problems i was having. while everything from the waist down fit perfectly, the arms were cut too tight, the chest was huge and yet i struggled to zip it up. an
1 I bought this online so didn't realize that the fabric at the bottom is very, very stiff. i was expecting something silky, or at least on the softer and more moveable side. the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt. that being the case, it kind of juts out in weird places. the sweater part is very nice, but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture. the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o
3 As much as i had wanted this to work for me, it didn't. fabric is not as soft as i had expected and quality is just bad. i purchased this online (on sale at $29.95) and i had envisioned this to be comfy stretchy and swingy with a flow. i sent this back to the store as it didn't seem fit even at the low price.
3 I am on the fence about this top. i like the color but i'm not sure what to make of the style. the top part of it, around the chest and straps is lovely and flattering, but the bottom flairs out way more than i like. the back is longer than the front and it's almost a pregnancy top in how much it flairs. it's also quite thin and flimsy material given how expensive it is, even with the tag sale. the color, pattern and the chest part of the top is nice enough that i may keep this one, but, as i sa
3 I couldn't believe how fast this dress sold out when they were having the fall promotion; they had just put it on the website and it sold out in my size in a matter of hours!  i just received the dress today and really like the practicality of it.  you can easily dress it up or down and it still looks sheek either way.  what i didn't like about the dress was that the material is a little flimsy compared to how it looks in the picture.  i am on the fence regarding if i will keep it.
3 Looks great from the front, but from the side it looks like a maternity top.
3 This top is very cute, but i found it runs small in the bust, which is unusual for maeve. i will have to return it. you may want to size up, if you have a generous bust.
3 The picture of this top is misleading. it's more like a tent/ super short dress. i ordered my usual size (l) and could easily get away with a small in this top, if the arm holes were not too tight. i def. need to go down to a medium, and maybe even a petite medium since i'm 5/3. the top is 100% cotton, but there is so much fabric there is no way a little shrinkage would offset the amount of extra fabric. it looks like a tent on. plus, the picture and description make it seem like a normal top le
3 So, this is just the most lovely romper. beautifully made, flowey. very comfortable, until you have to take it off.this is the review i posted on facebook. so, no man i know has ever ever ever experienced the abject terror, or maybe has not shared with me, that moment when you cannot get out of, because it has turned into a straight jacket, that otherwise cute romper. and again, maybe a man invented it!
3 I ordered this in a medium and although the details/design of the shirt were cute, the "swing" did not work for me this time around. i typically like looser fitting tops, but with this shirt i felt like there was just too much material and made me feel like i was wearing a tent.
3 I bought the white tee. while the print is nice, the size is a bit too large with the xs looking relatively baggy (i am around medium weight and very short).
3 I wanted to love this. i have been looking for a poncho-type sweater for our cold midwestern winters. the cream colored one that i really wanted sold out instantly and i missed the window for the xxsp. i ordered this in the xs/sp (smallest size available). i am 5'1" and 108 lbs with small shoulders. the neck opening is huge. my collar bones and a seciton of my upper back were exposed. this would not keep me warm due to so much exposed skin on my neck, back, and shoulders. i suppose i could get a
3 I wanted a casual but special summer dress and had high hopes for this one. i normally like to try things on as it is difficult to tell fit online. when it arrived i was disappointed with this dress. it is very full in the skirt, the top fit a bit odd, not a lot of shape and not especially flattering. the fabric wasn't very exciting either.  unfortunately this one went back.
3 I purchased this shirt with the purple colored flowers. while the cut is fine, the quality of the fabric is not great so the shirt is very see-through. will be returning it.
3 I am usually a size 2 in tops. i am very, very rarely a size 0, so upon reading other reviews of this top i decided to order the 2 and assumed it would fit the way a 2 usually does. obviously this is designed to be a loose, flowing top. that's why i wanted to order it. however, the 2 is simply too loose in every direction. my primary gripe is that the arm holes are gaping and falling at the side in a way i don't think it intended.i do really like the styling and quality, so i am planning on
3 Though the quality is good and the fabric is both sturdy and soft, the cut of this top made this a no-go for me. it's a bit short in front and also boxy, which is emphasized by the dolman sleeves. i ordered the coral color and it was much brighter - almost neon-y - as opposed to the soft salmon color my screen shows. i regretfully returned it.
3 The purple/cobalt is a beautiful color. i feel the t shirt material is entirely too thin for the price.
3 I was hoping to love this tunic, but it isn't what i was hoping for. the material is cute, but the piece itself is a little too baggy and just doesn't do anything for my shape. just made me look boxy all around. it felt more like a poncho than a tailored tunic. unfortunately, it has to go back.
3 I really wanted to love this dress! the quality is great, and the overall look is so lovely. however, i tried two different sizes (petite s and petite xs) and it still looked too baggy/big. the upper part is wider than it appears. also, the photos shows the bottom two buttons buttoned up. however, the dress doesn't actually have any loop holes or button holes, so it just hangs open. very sad to have to return both dresses.
3 I wanted to love the stress so much i mean who doesn't love polkadots and a good maxi! unfortunately the fit was too awkward. the bust is saggy and the waist seems to poof out
3 I really liked these jeans initially, but by the end of the day the waist is really baggy. the fabric stretches with wear and takes a wash to get back to its original shape.
3 The top is gorgeous and bohemian like with a loose fit. the top arrived with a small black stain and some of the lace already ripped. it might be too delicate for me to even exchange for another and wear. i am going to have to return it.
3 The item i received was not distressed. i bought one size larger thinking they'd be super slouchy, but they just looked sloppy. also, the hips puffed out in a very strange way. i wanted to love since they are so cute and soft, but i look like a man with hips in these jeans. returning this weekend.
3 I really love the look of this jumpsuit, casual but classy. shapely but comfortable. i'm 5'4 and, similar to another reviewer, proportional torso to leg ratio. the legs were longer on me than the model in the picture, but no problem there because they're cuffed.however the arm holes are too big. my bra shows, and the particular one i got came damaged with some of the embroidery coming unraveled on the back. it's also supposed to be dry cleaned and that's annoying for casual wear. returning it.
3 Nice soft jeans, cute style, and i wish i could keep them...they just are too small on me. :/ not sure if i've gained weight (which i don't think i have because i had on a size 28 pair of pants today) but i ordered a size 29 in these jeans and they zipped but just too snug around the waist. i would honestly need a 30 or 31. looks like they are selling out quickly so i doubt i'll be able to get the size i need. if you have a small waist i think they would be fine but they don't fit my body type
3 I so wanted to like these pants. i wear a lot of "genie" pants because they're comfortable. the problem with these is that they're too narrow towards the ankle, but the worst is the fabric. its "old lady" fabric. i was hoping for a pair of blousy joggers in a light denim, and this fabric was disgraceful. i knew the minute i saw them that they were going back. i'll keep looking and hoping.
3 While the fabric, embroidery and sizing are dead on, i just couldn't deal with the shiny little mirrors that the designer embellished this shirt with. that detail is not apparent in the photographs and i felt lessened the versatility of this blouse. so, it must go back to retailer.
3 Loved the idea of this top--but it just won't work for me. it's really big. i'm 5'3" and 125 lbs. a small should be fine, but i'm swimming in this. the back is pretty (i tried it on with a white cami), but it looks very maternity on me. tried to order the xs, but it's sold out. too bad. was a cute idea. not too thin for summer.
3 I received the moss skirt today. the material felt very soft and like good quality. i'm 5'4', 125 lbs and had ordered size 4 regular. unfortunately the skirt was huge and also very long, below the knees. the cut was not flattering for me as the material stuck out very wide on the sides. possibly a smaller size and petite would help but are sold out already in moss. plus i'm not sure the sticking out would be fixed, that might be the cut of the skirt. it didn't work for me and i will be returning
3 I really like the color and flow of this dress. the dress itself fit well however the slip was extremely tight through the bust. i have a large bust at 34d however most dresses are still wearable especially flowy dresses. unfortunately i had to return this one because of the slip.
3 May look better on someone tall. thin, and straight.
3 I really wanted to love this sweater after reading all the reviews, but it just didn't work for me. the pattern is amazing (almost a little over powering, making it one of a kind and unique) but what i didn't like the color of the knit collar and front bands----it's an old looking mauve-tweed grandpa color. i probably would have kept it if that color was different. it was returned to find a different coat style sweater.
3 I wanted to love this dress!! i eyed it for months before deciding to purchase, and when i hit submit, i purchased a size down, given the prior reviews. excitedly, i whiled away the moments until it appeared in my mailbox. as soon as this dress was delivered, i ripped it out of its packaging and ooohed and aaahed over the beautiful lace overlay and the halter cut. hurriedly, i pulled the dress over my head, allowing it to drape over my body. and drape it did, but not in a good way; rather, the d
3 The material is beautiful and as others said its a bit fuller than one might think. i am returning because it's high waisted with a thick elastic waist band. not my style - i suppose it would work with a thick belt. as i said its beautiful - just not my style.
3 Great quality top. i do wish it fit me...i'm really long waisted and this top was too short. had to return
1 I've been shopping at retailer since 2007, and floreat used to be my favorite designer, but for the past year or more, floreat mostly misses the mark. this blouse looks nothing like it does on the model. 1. it is long on her, not so in real life. this is probably the worst part about this blouse. if it were not for this, i might try on a size m and give it another chance.2. it runs very large. i usually take a l or xl. i think i would need a m in this, as mentioned above.3. in the picture, t
3 This dress is nice colors and well made but it's just not the style for me. it almost fits frumpy. i'm not sure that a belt would even make it look good. also being 5'8, it is shorter than i'd wear. i like at least touching top of the foot for a maxi.
1 I agree with the other reviewer who said there was too much hardware and such. this really does have a lot going on. i usually wear a 4 in skirts, and based on reviews, went up one size. it still saw way up near my chest - i think even an 8 would be too small! it's sooooo tiny at the waist. probably buy 2 sizes, 2 and 3 sizes up from your own. also, the skirt flares super wide at the sides, it doesn't sit the way in the photo or maybe the model is holding it down with her hand. it's like a skirt
3 I got this shirt in stores because it went on sale! i was excited to wear it, but it felt a little long on me. i decided that after a regular wash, it would help it. after washing, it shrunk way more than my other retailer clothes! now the arm straps feel really tight and the fabric lost its flowy-ness. it's a classic shirt, but it may not be worth the price for the quality of the fabric. be careful when washing.
3 If you can get over the fact that this skirt feels (and looks awfully similar to) the exact same fabric your drugstore halloween costumes had when you were a little kid... then, it's surprisingly fun to wear.
3 I knew there was a problem when my dress arrived and the small fit perfectly when i was 9 months pregnant...i even bought a small even though i normally wear mediumi bought it for family pictures once my daughter was born but it made me look like i was still pregnant even though i had already lost all the baby weight in 3 weeks.it is a beautiful dress though and may try to get it altered to see if that works
3 I was very excited about this dress but when it came i saw it had too much going on. it either needs the ruffle taken away ( my first choice) or the halter part taken away. in the end i think it needs to go back.
3 I ordered this dress after seeing it styled with a beautiful cape.  when it arrived, it was incredibly soft and the color was a pretty, muted pink.  however, once i put it on, it clinged to all the wrong places.  having a larger chest made it show a lot of cleavage and if i can't wear a standard bra with it, it's too complicated.  in a regular tank dress, it would have been a yes. overall a great dress, but probably for another body type.
3 I ordered this dress when it was briefly on sale with an extra percent off. i was very excited to receive it in my usual size large, and wear with a jean jacket and cowboy boots. when i took it out of the package, i could tell it looked really small. i didn't even try it on. i had my daughter who wears a size small try it on, and she couldn't even get it over her hips. if you are tall and thin like the model, it will work for you. it is made of cupro, looks exactly like the photo, the color is g
3 I was really excited to get this top but unfortunately its going to have to go back. i am 5'6 120 and usually a s fits. however, this was really tight. also, the material is really really thin for the $90 price-tag. save yourself some money and avoid this one.
3 Tried this on and loved it except for one thing -- the sleeves are split, so any movement reveals most of your arm, shoulders. which also makes it fairly impractical for winter/the office (yes, i could wear a sweater or blazer with it, but that defeats the purpose of having an all-purpose cute top.) why, retailer? this is a perfectly cute top and looks great with jeans etc., but the split sleeves make it a no-go.
3 I'll start by saying that i loved this dress. i tried it on in the dressing room and knew i had to have it. the colors and design are beautiful and the fabric is soft. i did have to size up but it fit me perfectly once i did. i'm 5'1" 130 lbs 34 d size 6 fit great. the first time i pulled it out at home, i was gently pulling up the zipper and once it hits those ribbon areas on the side, the zipper seam split. i tried for a half hour to get it to realign. i finally decided to go exchange it for
1 The material is cheap and looks torn. not as nice as the picture.
3 The fit is really flattering and cute but the fabric and finishings seem really cheap. it's a printed plaid - not woven.
3 I ordered the geranium and teal. geranium is an awkward pink, but i loved the teal. beautiful color. ordered large, hoping for some length. they're very lightweight and almost too short. if you hold this up its just a big rectangle, but it flows nicely over the body and has the appearance of being longer on the sides. unfortunately you can see all of my bra and to my stomach when my arms are even slightly raised. i decided to return both.
3 Super soft, super cute but too short for a dress, too long and too overwhelming for a shirt, and didn't like the look with leggings at all so sadly i'm returning. love the colors, feel and style but no way will sizing up or down fit in a way that was functional...having said that..fits tts i guess.
1 There were no reviews, it's an "online exclusive" and thought it might look good with a nice skirt at an upcoming wedding. the spandex jersey back looks like sweat shirt material. on the white version of this, it is mismatched with an oatmeal color and white that just looks awful. as a busty 36d i was stunned to find myself swimming in a medium. it does not look like the photograph and the sleeve billow out. i feel like this had to have been clipped and tucked in for this photograph. i'm an anth
1 I've purchased pilcro jeans in the past and they've held up great. unfortunately, the material used for this particular jean is a far, far cry from what it used to be. the thighs of these jeans start pilling (yes pilling!) after just a few wears. i've never had jeans do this -- whatever denim blend they are using is a complete disaster.don't buy these -- you will be very disappointed.
3 I have been searching high and low for some good quality jeans. sadly i don't think these are it. i love the design and style of these jeans. great length, great cut, great color unfortunately in the 3 weeks that i have had them they are balling and looking like i've had them for 3 years. i'm so disappointed. and will have to continue on my search. apparently they don't make jeans like they used too?
3 Beautiful sweater coat! love that is easy to pop on & head out. i did have to go to a seamstress and have the button moved as it was to large and boxy around my waist area.
3 This sweater has a fun big bold flower and a nice blue color and is quite roomy. the fit is larger around the arms and chest, which might work well for people who are very curvy on top. it seems to taper a bit to the waist. the roomy fit to the arms gives it almost a bat wing shape. it was too overwhelming on my petite frame, what with the bold flower and the fit, so i passed. but if you like the big flower and color and want a roomy sweater, this could work well for you.
1 I stalked this sold out product for weeks hoping my size would become available. when it did, i was very excited, in fact i ordered both a s and xs to be sure one sweater would fit me! unfortunately, neither did and i felt the actual sweater was not as pictured. the sweater has an overall baggy fit and the cutouts don't fall as neatly and as evenly on both shoulders as the picture shows, making the look a bit sloppy in my opinion. it is such a shame as this look is very of the moment and the mod
3 I tried this sweater on in the store. i love the design and was hoping it would look as good on me as it does on the model. first off i should point out that the navy color in the featured photo looks much lighter than the sweater does in person. some of the photos accurately represent how dark the blue is (it almost looks black) but the featured photo shows it more like a medium navy. secondly, anyone looking to purchase should know it is very warm. if you are buying to wear mostly indoors you
1 #childsize. not sure where this went wrong but it's going back immediately. always wear a 0-2 in retailerpologist skirts, this size 0 runs at least two sizes too small. the material is beautiful, but if i got the size i needed i would be entirely swallowed by fabric. so disappointing.
3 This very lightweight cardigan looked like an eggplant color online. it's brown with a hint of burgandy. not bad, but unexpected. i am very short -waisted, and this lies very high on my torso. the seams are unfinished, and it looks cheaply made. glad i got this on sale.
1 These jeans were so cute on- wore them a handful of times and they'd been washed twice. put them on and - rip! ripped right at the crotch in the front so not fixable- and on vacation no less when i had to scramble to find something else to wear. poor quality - disappointing and not what i expected from retailer. :-( they also run large even for a more relaxed fit- sized down for a good fit.
3 I found these to fit odd. i am also use to wearing the skinny jeans so trying a wide leg was a bit weird anyway. the placement of the pockets and the way it hit my waist was awkward and not flattering. i am usually a 8/10 and the 8 fit but just did not look good.
3 I really loved the color and fabric of this sweater. i liked everything about it except how wide it was at the bottom. i returned it for this reason.
3 I was really hoping that this dress would fit perfectly because it looks beautiful on the model! however, when i put the dress on, there is a seam where the top portion meets the bottom portion and it made the skirt stick out a ton. i ordered the 0p and i am 5'4" 110lbs. maybe ordering this dress in a larger size would prevent the skirt from looking so full at the top.
3 Received this and love the style, but it falls just a little below my waist and i like my tops to be longer.  it'll definitely fit a shorter torso.
3 While i love the design, this sweater even in the small is too over-sized for me and was unflattering. it was returned.
1 Unfortunately this top is shirt-length, and i'm only 5'4". needs to be about 6" longer. made of sweatshirt material, which i wouldn't mind if it were longer. also runs very wide- ordered an xs and could have gone smaller.
3 The fabric is beautiful, even the lining is lovely. i ordered the green color in a large, as i'm curvy and have long arms. but it just doesn't lay correctly at all - the collar has no structure, even though it's a lapel, and the side vents just pop out - the jacket added about 10lbs, and just looked frumpy. it looks much more tailored on the model. too bad, as i have been looking for a velvet blazer in the color for a long time.
1 I wanted to love this blouse so much. but try as i might, it just fit so oddly on me. i'm usually a petite s so i purchased the xs in brown. first. the color was more gray-brown but it was still ok. but second, the fit was off. maybe i just got a bad one, but the center of the blouse was so offset, that the slit in the front laid so far to the left and the v-neck was so low that you could see my bra - there was no adjusting i could do to fix it. the material has a lovely soft silky feel to it an
1 I really wanted to love this top, but there is way too much fabric. it looks nothing like the pictures. it was more like a maternity top vs. a swingy top. i'll be returning this one.
3 This dress felt small in torso and waist and suffocating in sleeves ( i do have average athletic arms). but the shoulders were cut so wide that one side was falling off, as i fix, one shoulder, another will slide down.the material is nice but since it is not lined, it feels inexpensive, disposable.
3 This dress is such a beautiful color and the fabric is super soft and lovely. it would be stunning on someone with a slim figure, but since i've got curves/an athletic build, it simply did not work. too bad, because it is such a pretty dress!
3 This top is much stiffer, more baby-doll and boxier than pictured. lining is stiff too, and colors more muddy than shown. i wear boho tops all the time and this looked terrible on me (i have broad-ish shoulders and a chest). i thought it would be a fun, drapey top for transition to fall but unfortunately it's going back.
1 Like the previous review said, i was excited to receive this top. i had grand visions of all the ways i could wear it! to my chagrin, when i put it on, it just fell right down and pooled around my waist. i wish there were smaller sizes to order. sadly, this is going back.
3 This blazer is a nice weight for summer. it is more terracotta than rose, but is still a nice color. the fit is tts and flattering. however, the buttons were almost falling off the one i received. i didn't take this as a sign of great quality and plan to return it.
3 I love the material of this shirt and i love the design; however, there is just too much fabric. it felt very boxy and gave me no shape at all. for someone who is petite this just wasn't flattering. i love the design idea though!
3 This sweater is great i bought the black version on sale. my complaint is the pulling factor though. you don't expect retailer sweaters to pill after a couple wears. overall i love the fit and look though so i continue to overlook it and use my sweater comb as needed!
3 This is a beautiful dress. all that's missing is a bonnet!
3 I think these jeans are good for people with long lean legs. i'm 5'7" 155 lbs and the wide cuff made my legs look short and stubby. the weight of the jeans is a little on the heavier side - i usually like soft denim. i usually wear a 31 and thought they were true to size.
3 Beautifully made. beautiful drape. deep  blue. so long tho i have to role it up at the waist so nix on tucking a white blouse in. why is it so long???? in 5'6" and got a large. with 2 inch heels i still trip and not about to wear really high herls. ill keep it tho because its a nuce dressy skirt. may take it to be hemmed but the last item i got hemmed ended up an uneven mess
3 This is a heavy dress - it's surprising when you lift up the hanger how much it weighs because it looks like a light sundress. and on my frame, which is pretty thin, it hits my shoulders and then my hips and just falls... so the heft of it means there's no waistline... it's an odd fit. the color is gorgeous, but the lack of shape made this a no.
1 This is not a kimono. it's a cocoon. there's a huge difference.it's also not made very well.
3 I was excited to try something by this designer and decided to order size large. unfortunately, this top just looked very odd. cute from the front but it wings out in the back where the sleeves meet the arms. the fabric makes an odd poof in that area. i do have a large bust and it didn't pull anywhere in the front. i expected it to be soft and drapey but the cotton feels very coarse and doesn't drape well. it covered my behind in back. unfortunately it made me look wide from the side view. i hav
3 Purchased these pants that i had quickly tried on. when i got home, i re-tried them and felt they were too snug and the material had an odd feel and did not lay right. i took them back and tried them in the next size. they fit much better but the material did not lay well on me. i think that they are a bit too stretchy and ended up not buying the larger ones either. i would definitely recommend trying these in a store rather then ordering online.
3 The style of this dress is quite lovely, i immediately gravitated towards it when i saw in the store, however once i tried it on it looked like a sack of potatoes...unfortunately the loose silhouette did not do anything for my figure, i should mention that i am 5'9" and have an athletic figure but with hips. the design is very on trend and the dress does have some lovely details like the lace around the hip area and flowy fabric. but unfortunately it was not enough for me to purchase. also the
1 From the photos, i thought the design was embroidered. in reality, it is stamped on. there is a tiny bit of embroidery and a few sequins, but overall, the design is just printed on the fabric. i didn't feel it looked good, in fact it looked kind of cheap to me, so i returned it. the overall style of the jacket was great and it would have looked equally good for work or casual. i was disappointed it didn't work out.
3 I didn't realize it had a tie around the waist. it seems too much material hanging in the front to tie at the waist. unfortunately the sash is attached and cannot be removed. it's very cute; just not for me.  i will have to return (but sure i can find something else)!
1 Didn't like the dress. look pregnant in it. this dress is going back.
3 This is a very light, flowy dress. the lining is very fitted, but the dress is actually not fitted. it has a nice flow, but hits right at the thigh area before flowing out. plan to wear it to work.the color is very bright and pretty.
3 I wanted this dress to work so badly but if you have any chest or any hips this won't work for you. i tried in petites and regular and it just didn't work at all
3 Very cute coat but could not keep it for the price...just not sure it is worth almost $200,00 (with tax added to cost). when it goes on sale, i will most likely buy it.
3 It's hard enough for women to find clothing that will make them look as beautiful as they feel but add a bigger bust size (i'm a 36dd) and it makes it this much harder. i ordered this top because of how beautiful it looked on the model and the price. when it arrived i was so excited! retailer does such a beautiful job with the way they handle their items! it was wrapped beautiful and no damage. i ordered a size 8 knowing that my chest could be a potential problem. the too itself is gorgeous! i did
1 I thought from the picture this would be a light floaty top. when it arrived, the fabric was a heavy knit and the neckline sagged very low. on me (granted i'm a pear) the bottom layer hugged my tummy and rear in a very unflattering way. the only thing i liked was the color. back it went.
3 Got this in the mail today and while the design is cute, it's not as soft and comfortable as i would like. the front clasp takes a bit of practice to get on and off. the straps are a bit thin and hurts a bit.
3 Looks better online than in person. material makes it look a little puffy
1 I'm 5'7", 130 lbs. i ordered a medium-regular. the dress fell three inches above my knees. this model is taller than i am, and it falls to her knees....doesn't make sense. i think retailer sends petites in place of regular.
3 I was so excited to get this! the fabric is beautiful - comfy soft and a great wash/print of blue. it reminded me of the ocean. however, the fit was off. the waist was too high, the length too short, and the straps to long. i was very disappointed. i considered taking it to the tailor before returning. ultimately, i decided to return.
3 So, i bought 2 of these. first in xsp. it was actually the regular length not the petite one. it did have the problem mentioned by others regarding the arms, armpit, thighness issue. i thought maybe the dress was mislabeled and i got a regular xs by mistake. so i returned and order another xsp hoping i would get one with the right length, but no. the one i got has same issues as the first one. why 2 petite dresses with regular length/? i think the dresses are defective. the print is gorgeous and
3 I'm actually surprised no one has reviewed this yet. i took the plunge because it seemed like a classic wardrobe staple, nothing too flashy or fancy, that would go well with many outfits. my thoughts below:__________________pros:- fits tts. i'm normally either a 10 or 12 and got the large. it fit well and the elastic isn't too tight. fit very well for me because i have wider hips. so if you're straight or slim, you could probably size down.- exactly as pictured. it does have a nice flow
1 I really liked the design. ordered a medium which was huge. also thought i would not be able to tolerate it because of the material -- a bit itchy. returned it.
1 I'm a big retailer buyer- and usually love the dresses, especially the petite xs maxis. this was the worst retailer purchase i have ever made. it was humongous and gave me no shape. even if i purchased an xxsp it probably would be the same. i'm small but i mean come on- this would only fit a giantess-- which also makes no sense because it's the petite size. do not buy. i'm very upset i have to pay the $5.95 return fee since i ordered this.
3 Being that i am short, 5'2", this skirt flares out way too much resembling a 50's style poodle skirt. the model in photo has her arm strategically placed thus pushing back excess fabric toward the back making it look more streamline. this skirt is not for the under 5'5". long leggy types could easily "rock" this.
3 I received this in the mail and it looked beautiful but the zipper was broken just like one of the other reviews. normally i would just exchange but i don't know if it's worth getting another broken one.
3 The fit is a little bit odd, it is short and wide, too much fabric. the quality is not good, the buttons can easily break and the stitching was falling apart. i am returning it.
3 Nice dress to wear while seasons are transitioning
3 I'm glad this was on sale because i would not have purchased it at full price due to the strange fit in the sleeve. the shirt has a slight raglan sleeve, but the sleeves do not fit loosely, they kind of twist under the armpit area. i do not have large arms, so i am ok with straightening out the knit sleeves, but they do not fit right. i also was surprised at the unfinished edge along the neckline. it is messy and tacky looking, but i think that is how it was meant to be. my recommendation to buy
3 Lovely knit and so soft, but the bottom curls up underneath, similar to the bell sleeves. runs oversize too, got xs and it's too bulky and unflattering since the bottom doesn't lay flat. returned!
3 I actually love this dress.  the colors on the dark gray are mesmerizing.  the design of the placket adds a special touch to the look.  my issue is the way it looks on my body--not flattering.  i already have a squarish apple (squarple?!) body and the cut emphasizes this more.  i was hoping the fabric would hang on me the same way the ivory dress on the curly haired model does, so i sized up.  all this did was make me look wider, especially at the shoulders.  the drawstring at the elastic makes
3 This is a pretty dress, but it runs at least one size too large. the silk is of good quality. it would be good for somebody who is slim and tall.
1 Sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is. i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life. this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style. another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump . i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was $5.00!!!
3 I typically wear a size xl in retailer clothes. i'm a size 16 in tops and this sweater in xl fit really baggy with no form fitting. it's super soft and i love the color, but it was just unflattering on me.
3 This sweater looks soft and flowy on the model, but in the store it is rather stiff lace in the back and very plain in the front. i did not like the ribbing on the front bottom of the sweater because it pulled in places and didn't lie flat. way too expensive for what you are getting.
3 I really liked the look of this top online, but when it came i had a couple of issues with it. first, when i tried it on i found the underarms to be a little snug (i normally wear a 10/m, and that's what i ordered). it makes raising my arms tough, and as a teacher, i need to be able to lift my arms above my waist. secondly, my husband's first reaction was that it "looks like pajamas." the abstract floral/stripe gets a little lost.on the other hand, the color palette is very pretty and the qual
1 The fabric wrinkles so easily and any slight moisture or liquid immediately turns into a dark spot on the blue grey...condensation drips from a glass, gel deodorant, etc. i tried the cream but it's very sheer. i had to return this dress-- not practical!
3 Unfortunately this piece has a very boxy cut and the white layer is stiff and billows out - i am tall and thin but this made me look pregnant - very unflattering. i considered trying a smaller size, but i did not like the material too much either so i just returned it.
1 I loved this skirt when i tried it on. the material is soft with a bit of stretch. i'd say this runs a little large. for reference, i'm usually a size 2/4 in retailer and the 2 was still a little large towards the end of the day as it stretched out. however, my disappointment was with the buttons.i wore it for a day when all of a sudden the top button popped off. fine, that button is the most used. i sewed it back on myself and even reinforced the top three buttons that i use to take on and of
3 I want to love this dress. the colors and pattern are gorgeous, and i love the hemline. but something seems off in the chest and shoulders area. it almost feels a little slouch-y.
3 The color and detailing on this shirt are pretty, but it is incredibly wide at the hips. as someone with a large chest, it was very unflattering.
1 The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality, and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit, immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.
1 This shirt fits very closely to the body. it has a very strange fit in the shoulder, though. the arms themselves are really long, far past my hands, yet it's very tight in the shoulder and under arm area. for reference, i am 5'10", 130 pounds and ordered a small, which is what i usually need.
1 I generally don't write bad reviews, but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost. the design and colors are great, but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturer's tag is at the back of the neck. the material is very thin, so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment. i shop at retailer all the time, and this is not a $98 item of clothing.
3 Although i am small (size xs on top, 27 waist) this dress is not flattering if have any fat on your body....i would not recommend it.
3 Didn't love it, didn't hate, rather indifferent. the grey was a little more muted than i wanted for a summer tee.i'm 5'4", 123lbs, 34a, the xs fit if it wouldn't shrink, if you're about this size but larger busted go with the s.
3 I absolutely loved the idea of an elongated hoodie as a lounge dress or robe. unfortunately, this particular product left a lot to be desired. firstly, the fit is slim, not relaxed. i'm 5'4", at 110 lbs and tried both the size 1 (equivalent of a small) and size 2 (equivalent of a medium). sizing up just added length and did not do much to increase roominess. they both zipped up easily but did not drape well. finally, the fabric was really not welcoming. i prefer terry over fleece, however this w
3 I recommen only becuase i like it on other people, but not on me. the pull on style didn't work, i need xs petite to fit lenght and waist, but the waist wasn't elastic enough to "pull up" (i have let's say a booty#. i kept hearing hte stiching give... it also looked a little too poooofffy on my frmae, i am 5'1.5" and it stuck more out than on the model. nice idea, btu not for me. #i am 115 lbs#
1 This was a disappointment because beautiful fabrics with interesting design are a rarity--and especially at this length! unfortunately, this is a mess in terms of proportions. if a size 2 can barely get it off, then there is a design flaw. sadly, the fit was so strange that it did not seem that simply sizing up would correct the flaws.
1 Extremely cute sweater, but after having worn it twice it's already pilling up. i'd expect more for a $100 sweater.
3 Cute design. runs big in neckline, falls off shoulder exposing bra straps. fabric is very thin. sloppy look on short petite frame. 5'1" 142lbs 34-36 c/d. purchased a medium. haven't washed it yet, but the fabric doesn't look like it will hold up well. i have kept it to wear as a sleep shirt with thin gray sleep sweats.
3 I bought this because i thought it would flatter my boxy big busted shape and it does. however, while i liked the irregular hemline on the model, on my 5'5 frame it hits at a strange place and so i will hem it a little shorter. the fabric is extremely thin and not lined so this is definitely a light weight summer top even here in the south. i love the modern styling but the quality of the fabric is a concern, definitely no dryer on this one.
1 I ordered this skirt in a size small and when i received it, not only was it too long, but there was also a hole in it. so i returned it. when a small petite became available, i ordered it thinking it would fit better. i just received it and there is a hole in this skirt as well. both skirts also looked as if they had been worn; there was fuzz and lint all over the skirts. i like the skirt but i either have extremely bad luck or it's really bad quality.
3 I agree with the other reviews that these jeans run big. for my body, straight up and down, i ordered 2 sizes down, but would have ordered one size down had i been able to try them on in the store. the jeans i received were lighter, not blue, and more grey with very noticeable white whiskering. i need a new pair of jearns and i love the cut of these so i am keeping this pair, but, for me, because of the color they are just ok compared to the wow i was expecting from the picture.
1 If you have any curves, avoid! it is not flattering.the striped side panels look odd with the flow of the dress.
3 Unfortunately, this is a lot more boxy in person than it shows on the model. it hung on me like a potato sack. also, the color isn't the rich red it shows but more of an orangey rust.
3 I saw this jacket and loved the plaid and the idea of a soft sherpa material as a lining was hard to pass up1it was true to size and the material was very nice. however, the button closure was difficult as the buttonholes seemed a bit too small. also, the back of the jacket did not lay flat and it kept rolling.... i had to return this jacket.
3 I had high hopes for this top, as it looked great online. unfortunately it was much more ruffly in person and not my style at all. it was a lot of fabric and poofed out too much -- reminded me of a child's top. sad to return it!
3 I was very excited when this dress arrived in the mail. the fabric is so comfortable, but the print was overwhelming. it is also very tight on the top and i got lost in the fabric at the bottom. i had to return it.
3 The blue has three colors of stripes: blue, white and black 9between white and blue). the black stripe made it too busy for me. the material is soft and clingy. i followed the advice of previous reviewer and sized up to a m (normally wear s). the shirt fit as pictured on the model, not tight but form fitting.
3 Saw online and had to have. got it home and i was swimming in it! i normally am a size l in most retailer brands, but this felt so large! the actual top is lovely, with an airy artistic quality to it. not sure if i will go back for the medium or not.
3 This swimsuit is very well made and even prettier in person. i'm 5'8" and about 145 pounds. i usually wear a size 6. i wear a 34d bra. i found the suit to run a bit small. i returned it because, despite how much i liked the style, it just wasn't flattering on my body type.
1 I purchased this jacket in my local store. size 10 and runs really small . i love the color combination and design but the fabric in my opinion is poor quality. i have seen a lot of retailer use this poly spun knit in so much of their items and the jacket after bringing it home and looking in the light was already showing pilling. looks like it is worn in an bad way. returned the next day. this was a big disappointment and every time i see this fabric being used in retailer clothes it makes me mad.
3 I tried this top in xs in store.  i loved the macrame  detail and quality of fabric.  it billowed out too much below the chest and looked tent like.  my daughter laughed when she saw me in it- so did i!  i didn't buy it.  i'm 5'2", 115#.
3 Color is pretty true to pic, a bright blue red.  sleeves have more volume than pic.  so does the body.  in my opinion.  maybe if i looked like the model.  i wear a 27 in jeans and it doesn't look so cute on me.  also i'm a brunette.  angles?  pinning?  i have to wonder.  probably just pics at good angles.  it looks really cute on the model though.
3 I bought the tiny brand "cassia" tank last week in a small, and it fits beautifully. i ordered this "sorcha" tank in a small as well and it is huge! i am very sad about the huge size difference. look closely at the photos... the fabric twists as it goes over the shoulders to the back....it is quite bulky. hard to tell if that would minimize in a smaller size. my store doesn't carry this item so i can't easily try another.
1 An awful dress! retailer why didn't you post my last review. i would not even give it a quarter of a star.
1 I purchased this swimsuit in the mint. gorgeous color combination. i'm 5'5" and weigh 117 lbs. i purchased a small. the fit is true to size. i love the front design; however, my husband promptly brought the back of the swimsuit to my attention. the chevron was off center. the design should have been centered with my back; however, it was on the right side of my back. i immediately called retailer assuming the product was defective. the item was sold out on line; however, a supervisor was able to l
3 I think in general it is just hard to buy a bathing suit online, but i really underestimated the v-neck of this suit. i read the reviews and noted it was not recommended for girls with larger size breast. as i'm basically an a cup, i figured i would be fine. the top portion basically has no coverage or hold. even when tied very tight, the top still opened making me feel exposed and like my entire breast would fall out of the suit. needless to say my fiancã© was not a fan of the suit either. even
3 Lovely style. i got the navy color and it's beautiful. i'm glad i ordered a smaller size after reading other reviews. my usual size would have been too big and not as figure flattering. but but but the sweater came pilled all over. i don't know if it had been worn and returned or if it's just the quality of the material but seriously there was pilling on the entire sweater. because the style is so nice and it fits well, i'm going to keep it and de-pill it but was disappointed with retailer :(
3 These looked so cute and colorful! very sad to receive them yesterday and having to return them today. cute overall, but run large. depending on cut/style, i range from 2-4 in bottoms. i ordered a 2 in these, and they were just way too big. i would exchange for a zero, but i bought them for a trip this weekend. oh well.... consequence of online shopping!
1 Love the design of the fabric. i actually bought these in both colors. i gave only 1 star due stitching on the fabric, it's very scratchy.
3 Love pilcro, love the stripes and the length - but this particular pair of capris/crops are super tight fitting. i went up a size from my usual and still felt tight. i guess its just the cut/fabric combo. i wanted it to be a slightly less form fitting feel ...... may work for you, however!
3 The fabric is super soft and the grey is pretty, but it is light grey not dark grey as described when you select to buy it. my biggest issue with the top is that the cold shoulder arm reveals the entire arm, so if you aren't completely toned with your tricep and all over arm, it will show... which is why i bought this to hide my blunders
3 Maybe it's just me, but this skirt had a little more volume than i was expecting. i'm 5'7, around 125lbs and the small fit me well. i like that the waist is elastic in back providing some give, but allowing the front to look smooth. pockets are always great. i got a striped henley from retailer (which is awesome) to tuck into it & was excited for the 70s vibe.the problem is that it fell an inch or two longer on me than the model, and i already worry about midi skirts appearing frumpy without the
3 I ordered my usually size, xs, and it's just so wide and unflattering. looks like i'm wearing a tent. i don't understand why tops anymore are either huge or skin tight. why not something in between?!  the pink color is really pretty and the details are nice but it's just blah in terms of the fit.
3 This dress arrived with a black rope belt and belt loops. i did not see this in the photo. i thought it was a throw-on-and-go dress, not a belted dress. this, in addition to the weird sizing, caused me to return it. i am a size 4-6 in dresses and the size small i ordered was skin tight and bunched at the hips.
1 Quality was not what you expect from retailer, especially for the price. top is lined but skirt is not. material is tissue paper thin and see thru. there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat, it keeps popping up. however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives. was returned.
3 This is an adorable piece but the fit is a gamble. the crotch hung way too low for comfort on these so since i got a great sale price, i had them altered. i haven't worn them yet but i'm sure i'll get compliments when i do. so if you want to take chance on the fit and/or alter them, go for it!
3 Tried the navy in store. boy does it run big! i'm normally a size 6 / small (ish). 5'6", 34a-28-36. the xs was still quite boxy on me while the sleeves were well fitted. i understand this is the style and i like the design with the different sleeves.it was a no buy as the main fabric was already pilling in store and looked a bit cheap - sorry!
3 This is a flattering, comfortable, soft sweater the instant you put it on. a few instants after that, however, i found mine had relaxed a great deal to become baggy, and pilled even more to become a fuzzy wuzzy monstrosity. i'm not optimistic about its longevity and wouldn't recommend it except for the extravagant single-use buyer.
3 I so loved the look of this top and most of the reviews seemed really good. i thought the material was great and i ordered the blue which is a beautiful color....but......the fit was way off and the design is way off for a girl with hips. first the fit, the arm pits are low and don't actually tuck into where your armpits are, so you have this weird restriction in arm movement. then the design is not great either (and others mentioned this), the sweater at the bottom has way too much extra materi
1 Retailer consistently provides unique, sophisticated and quality made clothing. with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies, i shop with them exclusively. i suppose that i can't expect 100% perfection from retailer-but 99% of the time-that's what i get. this is that 1%...this sweater is truly awful! i cannot (or find it very difficult at least) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that, had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front
3 Tried this lovely with high waste, wide leg, black flowy pants. everything i could hope for and more, but not quite!size: blindly ordered size 6. i'm usually a small, occasionally xs in retailer brands like floreat and akemi+kin. i'm 5'5" tall, 130 lbs, 34d, 35-29-37, long torso, narrow shoulders, and short arms.fit: size 6 had just enough space through the bust. the lace edged sleeves were roomy and just reached my wrists. the shoulders were just right. extra fabric ballooned out around t
1 Do not buy this dress for full price. the design looks great but after receiving the dress, the material is made of extremely cheap slinky-ish polyester that you would find at a f21 store. the stitching is horrific and created an uneven "hump" on the back seam. just absolutely poor poor quality.
3 I took a risk on this dress despite the multiple reviews about the pouffy skirt and revealing neckline, because i loved the look of the blue motif print. alas, the adorable print, the handy bra-strap holders, and super-soft fabric were the only things that worked for me. i'm 5'3" and 120 lb, small up top, not especially curvy but not straight either, and i ordered my usual 2p. yup, the pleated skirt was much too full (i felt as though i was wearing a cheerleader's skirt) and the neckline was way
3 I love the look of this dress and i love the way it is cut. the one thing i do not love is the thickness of the material. it is just too much for a summer dress. it just felt heavy and hot. i still love this brand so i am hopeful for a few more great options to come out before summer is over.
3 Lovely jeans, love the details in the cuff bottoms. the front of the jeans, the relaxed "boyfriend" part was just too relaxed for me - too much material there that it was unflattering. otherwise cute.
3 I wanted to love this top. the color is wonderful in the pink and the material is silky soft. it is huge though, i am a 34 dd and bought my usual small! i am going to exchange for an xs and am hoping it fits.
3 I liked the idea of the diagonal color block but the fit of this tee was odd on me.  too tight around arms and way big and boxy around the mid-section.  going back.
3 This tank fit well and i loved the ruffle in the back and how it layed. but the front was not a good look and i will be retuning it.
3 Facing the mirror--near perfection. high waist emphasizes the narrowest part of the frame--pleats nicely hide any stomach flaws. color is an eye-catching deep mustardy perfection and the interlocking button pattern is creative and beautiful. the problem is the walk away. from that view, the skirt waist finishes just where there's a bit of extra flesh. the cut is more of a long a-line--fairly boxy--and the heaviness of the cotton maintains that structure, so while the look as you approach walking
3 This sweater is big and box. it looks very similar on as it does on the model. as other reviewers have mentioned, the embroidery on the shoulders is a bit itchy.
3 This is not worth $128. it looks cute on but....there is no support in the bust area. just a slight tuck in the fabric -it also is very flowy which is great and it is comfortable but for the price and the thinness and lack of meatiness to the fabric itself i cannot recommend and will be returning. i'll look for something else. i haven't bought from retailer in a dogs age and i hope the quality hasn't slipped - i will look for another option.
3 I loved the lines in this jacket, but ended up returning it because they didn't show up how i expected. the jacket had a surprisingly baggy fit (s on my usual s/4/6) and wasn't quite what i was looking for.
1 Beautiful fabric with soft drape. unfortunately the "captain kangaroo" pockets are awful. unless you have a straight up and down shape with no hips this is very unflattering. the pockets look like saddle bags and add a huge amount of fabric where most people don't want added bulk. very disappointing. returned.
3 I love the details and design of this top- my only issue is the top is a bit too "flowy".
1 This is a very awkward and unflattering shirt. i am very petite--90 pounds and 5'2". the arms fit--length and width, but nothing else about this fit. the scoop was so low and wide that i would require a shirt underneath. it fell exactly like a tent and made a bell shape around my thighs. yikes! it looks cute on the model, but not on me. the material is also very thin and felt sort of like it should be a pajama top.
3 I was so excited to receive this in the mail as it had been on backorder for awhile. the dress is beautiful, but run smalls the buttons on the back are nearly impossible to fasten. if you are single, good luck trying to get it buttoned. i'll be returning it.
1 This blazer looks great on the model and i have a long torso so i thought it would be perfect. when i got it it looked like a big box and didn't fit anywhere. the shoulder pads were giant and the bottom of the coat was huge. i got a small based on other reviews, but it was way too big. sadly, i had to return it.
3 Snags very very easily.  i hadent even gotten to take the tags off and it rubbed against another item and snagged! so disappointed as it is a beautiful top, lovely color and beautifully detailed! i'm so disappointed i was hoping to keep it but will be sending it back.
3 I really wanted this dress to work out, but i was slightly disappointed in the fabric for the sleeves. the fit was accurate. i'm 5'7 and ordered a 6, however, my husband said it looked too little girl like. i did end up returning it :(
3 I am 5' 7" with an athletic build (small chest, small waist, muscular hips/thighs). this shirt just hangs on me and makes me look much larger than i am. i purchased a small, an extra small would be way too short. i could see how it works for fuller figured girls.
3 This t is a beautiful color, and i wish it had worked. it is quite flimsy, however - very thin cotton fabric, without the nice drape that would have made this look good on. i also think it should have been cut a little longer; it flares out right at the hips,so instead of covering them, it highlights them. i'm disappointed, and am returning it.
1 I tried this blouse on and loved the style, comfort and color of the peach so much that i was preparing to buy it. when i pulled the sleeve the fabric came away from the cuff. i tested another spot pulling only gently and the same thing happened. too bad since the color would have been a great addition for me. but--i also tried the blue and it gets 4 stars, as the fabric is much better. it too is adorable, soft and did not tear on gentle testing. the two blouse colors are made from different
3 Cute design with interesting details. i felt it ran a bit large. i'm 5'8", 135 lbs, an 8 was too big and baggy. my biggest complaint with this skirt is the color. it's just not flattering.
1 The jeans look so different online! the pair i got did not have the stone washed look and was completely different cut. the rise is not as stated and is actually 10.5 inches! also, i'm a true 25 and the waist is like a 27, but the legs are super skinny. i'm so disappointed and i'm not even sure if is worth swapping out for a smaller size. these look more like men's cut jeans.
3 This is a lovely dress, but much more casual than i thought from the picture. the material is very thin and casual. i needed a dressier dress, and i didn't need another casual dress, so i sent it back, but it would be fine if you want something casual.
3 It is a beautiful coat, runs small. arms feel tight, i am typically xs, i can't even button it up. bottom is skirted, and falls beautifully. it is light weight coat, not really fit for cold weather.
3 Love the shape of this top and often look to retailer for corset-style summer tops that are pretty. this top is made from a thick, stiff fabric that doesn't breathe. so my usual size xxs was too constricting. tried an xs also and it basically fit but i still wasn't a fan of the very heavy fabric in a summer top. it's almost like a neoprene. the colors are an odd choice and not my favorite either. i wanted to see in person and they just don't cut it for me. would love in different colors and softer
3 This top is beautiful, however it runs beyond big!i ordered my usual size and i could have fit 2 of me in this top.i am reordering and going 2 sizes down!the tie back and embroidery is beautiful.
3 Initially, i bought this because i liked the color and style of this trench coat. i thought it could look very chic and polished. the problem was it was too large and too wrinkly. i'm 5'2 (115 lbs) and ordered an xs because petite sizes were unavailable. but i realize that a petite xs would've been a better fit. also the sleeves were too long even with an xs. i've already returned the product.
1 This is the most unflattering peplum top i have ever tried on. fit perfectly as a size 6 should in the arms, shoulder, chest... then the waist was huge! just hung off of me like a flour sack. it was wider than the chest measurements, which made me appear frumpy instead of tailored and classic. combine that with the high-low hemline and it looked like a project runway reject. sent back immediately, do not buy this if you have (or want to appear to have) an hourglass figure, it will do nothing for
3 Its just ok. the bodice is fitted and this dress runs tts. it does have a little more poof on the skirt part of the dress than it looks on the model. at this point in my life when i buy a dress i have to say right away "i love it" and i just didn't. my husband looked and said it is just a "blah" color on me. so that maybe part of it. the fabric is nice, doesn't seem inexpensive and the lining is soft and falls nicely underneath the lace. i am 5'(" and the dress does fall exactly as it is shown o
3 I order this shirt because it looked like a shirt you could dress up or down. when i got it the shirt was really wrinkled. therefore, i knew it would have to ironed a lot. it was quite boxy and was shorter in the front then in the back. i didn't realize that this shirt was two different fabrics. overall i think this shirt would be more flattering on a woman that was petite.
3 These are a wonderful trouser style pant. i love fitted than flared denim so this fit isn't my top pick but it's a cute style! thick quality denim fabric with a medium rise cut.
3 This blouse is a beautiful color and i love the dot design and texture. however, it is a much baggier fit than i expected based on the photo, and it looks a little bit like a maternity shirt on me. i usually wear a size 8 or 10 and i bought a size medium.
3 I saw this dress in the store and absolutely fell in love with the fabric and just had to have it. i ordered it on line in my size and when it arrived, i tried it on (or tried to try it on) and it didn't fit some parts of my bday (mainly in the bust). i ordered the largest size, so there was no where to go from there except to send it back. others here have complained about a strange fit in the tummy area (i.e., too much material). i never got to find out because i really couldn't get the dress
1 When i tried it on, it was a bit shapeless, but it was on a promo so i decided to get it. i kind off like shapeless. i've worn it three times and washed it gently in the machine as recommended (in a lingerie bag, always) and air dried it. it now has a huge rip on the sleeve seam, and i cannot see how this happened. the inner lining is soft and substantial  but the outer gauze layer is thin.
3 I am a proportionate 5'4" 39 year old and thought this dress would look great. it's a-line and looks a lot like the kind of dresses that usually fit me nicely. i bought it in an 8p, which is my normal size. the hips were a little too big, but not bad. the top part, however, was enormous. the cut in the shoulders/neckline was way too wide, the lace sleeves were way too big, there was too much room in the bust (my c cup was inadequate), etc. this dress would look nice on someone who is thicker/vol
3 Tried this dress on today in the store. i am a size 10, sometimes a size 8. the size 12 was the first size i tried that zipped all the way up. however it was still very tight around my stomach and bust. and then from having to size up, it flared out too much at the bottom for my liking
3 They were too small for me. i loved them other than that.
3 Beautiful top, the silk was good quality, not thin. ordered a 6 because it was selling out so quickly, wished i could have ordered the 4. will definitely try if they come back in stock.
3 This dress has so much potential- loved the pattern and the neckline. however, only one side of the waist was gathered with a fake sash leaving the other side plain. the gathered side was super flattering while the other side showed any little lump or bump. needless to say, i'm returning it.
3 These pants are lovely and comfortable, but they are entirely too delicate. i wore them once and nearly any time something touched them, they snagged. i was worried about it when i saw the fabric, and thought i'd give it a try, but i didn't think it would be this bad. for the price, i expect better quality. also, they run a little large- unless i pull the waist down low, it gaps in the back and these look better worn a little bit higher, closer to the natural waist. i'm usually a 4/6, 28/29 in b
1 I was really excited to get this dress, i initially ordered a small (i am a size 4) but when i tried it on, it was really tight. the bodice at the top fit strangely-i had to shorten the straps quite a bit, and the dress just looked off. i love retailer and get all of my dresses from there, and the look of the dress on line was beautiful, but just didn't fit right. i did love the lace look, and would love seeing more dresses with this design.
3 I was so excited about this top, super cute and fit perfectly but as soon as i washed it (cold, hand wash, air dry) it shrunk! now it is too short and tight. i did not expect the material to shrink so very disappointed.
3 This style is very pretty and flattering. i love the flow of the material and the open shoulders are nice for the design
1 Beautiful jacket and i got lots of compliments. true to size. it's not thick but it's very warm.
3 This would have been a perfect jacket for a trip i'm taking, light weight and very stylish. however the jacket runs huge, the arms are long but it was the shoulders that were too big. i wear a size 8-10 mostly 10 in retailer clothes i ordered the large and the shoulder seam was about 2? past my natural shoulders. i won't return for a smaller size because the fabric being wool (i should have checked) its unbearably itchy esp around the neck, you could wear a long sleeve top and a scarf but then it
1 I bought these and returned them almost immediately. the material looks nice, but itchy and heavy. the fit is too small and just uncomfortable to wear.
3 I ordered this sweater in xxsp and the sweater is still very large on me. it is definitely a sweater that is supposed to hang off of your shoulders, however, i'm finding that it wants to fall all the way off of me. the quality is nice. it is medium in weight. it has a cottony feeling, but it not super soft. it looks way better on the model shown than in person to me. i wanted to love it, but i only just like it. i think others will like this if you are looking for a fun, loose look in a sweater.
3 I saw this in my local retailer store and thought it was super cute. tried it on and was delighted. the top fits nice and looks crisp and nice - a great nautical look. the brass buttons add a pop to the shirt that is very nice. i usually wear between a medium and large in retailer shirts and the large fit perfectly. i am a 34d for reference and usually a size 12 on top. i bought the top and didn't notice until i got home that it is dry clean only! yikes. i hate that. this is a casual top to me.
3 The material feels substantial and decent. however the diameter of the opening for arm is too big, it exposes good chunk of my bra. have to return it. there're also loose fiber of the fabrics, not sure if it is because it's new.
3 Loved the style and color/design but this dress was simply too short in the front. the slip was also slightly tight over hips. i wish this was longer!
3 I didn't plan to wear this off shoulder. sadly the neck is too loose and big if worn on shoulder. the fabric is nice. i liked the vintage looking design that's black with purple flowers. the body has a lot of fabric and although i ordered size large, i would size down to a medium if i were to reorder. don't think i will, though.
1 I was surprised at the positive reviews for this product. its terrible! it cuts you in a weird place to make you look wide. the skirt is also not like the picture. its darker and heavier. the material isnt great. i had to return.
1 Do not waste your money on this.at first, i bought pilcro hyphen chinos short and i loved it. so i bought this pants in store too. i laundry them yesterday and they both came out colorless. i was so shock. fyi, i did not use bleach or chrolox, i mean i don''t use them.i will return them both.still mad. this is bad quality enough worth it.
3 I should have exchanged it for a smaller size, but i wanted to wear it, so my mistake. i tend to wear size 12-14, and the large is entirely too big. it also had piling right out of the bag. but it is just so soft that i tore the tag off and wore it anyway. if you get this, size down for sure.
3 I loved this but couldn't believe how small it was.
3 This top is really cute online, but that's about it.  it runs large, but even if i sized down the ruffles were a bit much and the top was a little boxy surprisingly.
3 I purchased these in a 26 petite and a 26 regular. the 26r was too long and bunched up terribly pass the knee. they were also loose in the waist and overall body. the 26p fit great in the waist and body, however; past the knee it was too tight and again it bunched but not as bad as the 26 reg. the overall quality of the jean seems fairly good. the fit just did not work for me so these go back and the hunt continues for white jeans. would love it if they made the hyphen jeans in white.
1 My husband never has anything negative to say about my clothes until i wore these pants! they are not flattering and kept stretching out until i could pull them off without unzipping them! baggy in the behind and sloppy looking. they are going back asap!
3 I love this piece because of its flattering stripes.i am 5' 9'', 150 lbs and ordered a medium. the large was just too big, the small too short and tight, but the medium fit well. however, the sleeves are a little large which was a disappointment, and because of this there's an awkward excess of fabric on the front next to the armpits. i also experienced that the shirt is not long enough to tuck in, how the model has done.
3 Was excited for this shirt. i usually wear a medium to large depending on the cut and material, so i went with a medium. i was swimming in it. definitely recommend ordering a size below your normal.
1 Ordered a l and xl, the sleeves were so tight on both sizes but the rest of the shirt was wide and loose. the tight sleeves were not proportional with the rest of the shirt. both sizes had to be returned.
1 I bought this dress because i saw it in stores when it first came to retailer. it was stunning. the colors were vivid and the beading was intricate. i regretted not purchasing it immediately. fast forward to today... the dress i received was not the one that was originally in stores. the fabric was different, there was hardly any beading, and the colors were washed out and dull. i read previous reviews saying that the dress was more like the studio pictures than the original promo. but t
3 I thought this was such a beautiful cardigan from the online photos. i ordered it in the small size but the fit is strange. the arms and wrist cuffs are so large it cannot be pushed up to stay out of the way for things i would like to do when wearing it (i'm a teacher and my classroom is that kind of environment). i was also confused by the front "collar" ribbing and how it was supposed to lay - open, folded over, partly folded over - it just didn't seem to have a particular style to this area.
1 I ordered this tee despite the price. the fabric is very thin and the quality was poor. nice concept for a tee, but failed in quality and value. it was returned.
1 I sized down as other reviewers suggested (usually an 8, went down to 6) and the dress fit fine--but it was not attractive. the cut was like a tent with an empire waist. really just not attractive. maybe it has to do with my body type, but compared to the model, this dress was so unflattering in-person. returned.
3 I'm 5'8" and 130 and this made me look huge. it was a small but too billowy. it is pretty, nice fabric and well made but i returned.
3 Finally a pretty maeve shirt that actually fit my (apparently) giant hulk arms.. but it's so flowy/swingy i had to return it. this might just be a problem with being a larger lady, but the excess fabric made me feel like i was wearing a tent and made me look 10x bigger than i was around my waist/hips, even when balanced out with leggings. i thought about trying to size down but wasn't sure if that would even solve the excess fabric problem and still leave room in the arms. of course i can't try
3 Beautiful dress appears well-made, but unfortunately i wasn't able to get it on! about 6 inch gap in the zipper over chest area. first time i've ever sent something back to retailer for not fitting.
3 This is a lot shinier in person, and the elastic band is really tight but i still selected true to size.there is a hi-lo hem going on that doesn't flatter my legs but it looks fantastic from the side.due to the stiffness of the material and the tightness of the band, it can get crumply on the side if you don't get the right size. the material feels a little thin and scratchy.
3 I wanted to love this shirt and thought i would based on the reviews. it runs really large however and while i love how flows it is i also looked pregnant. i am keeping though- looks nice layered under a jacket or sweater but alone i feel it looked sloppy and big....... which is sometimes just what you want so it is staying in my closet.
3 The sweater is very very warm. it looks okay, not the best but not bad. i had high expectations so was disappointed to see no closure, i don't wear sweaters and jackets without closures. i like having the option of closing buttons if it gets any colder. so i am sending it back.
3 This sweater is much more cropped than shown. the sweater i received was only 24 inches long. the color of the trim is black, not the navy or plum that i expected. quality does seem good.
1 Although i love retailer, this product isn't the quality or presentation i expect from them. the dress arrived stuffed into a small plastic bag and was a crumpled mess. the fabric wasn't soft and fluid as i expected, but rather was stiff and a little scratchy. i purchased the ecru version, which was also slightly darker than the photo showed. i returned the dress and will keep looking.
3 I am 5'2" and 115lbs......ordered the blue motif in small petite. they were not only too big overall but were way too long. i had to roll them up several times to get the right length. because of fabric design these would definitely have to be hemmed. i had to check tag because i thought for sure i got sent a regular length but they were petite. not sure if they are worth trying in a smaller size..... pants were really comfy but maybe too pajama like for my taste.
1 This dress looked adorable online, but unfortunately, it's not flattering at all, and it's completely see-through. completely. the material is so thin that i can't imagine it would hold up very well over time. this one is definitely going back.
3 This shirt is really cute but a little stiff. it does come with a slip, but the slip was tight, but the shirt fit, maybe even a little big. i used another cami under which was better. i think think the sizing is off in terms of slip vs. the actual shirt. i got it in the store with the 30% off, so it was a good deal. it does stretch out as you wear it, so it will get bigger and it did make me look a little bigger, but still cute on and for a summer shirt, it's thin, so it does work well in that r
3 These looked super cute online and i was excited about getting them. i wanted that slightly baggy look to be able to carry them off similar to the model. so i referred to the size chart and ordered the size that said it would allow this. based on the size chart for this item...it is wrong. i should have had extra room. instead they were tight around the hips. i measured my hips before ordering and i am a seamstress....so i know where and what to measure. this is a nice quality product though...j
3 I love the looks of this sweater on the model! after receiving it, it was still very pretty and stylish to look at. my problem is that i am petite, and the sweater seemed to run very large. it wasn't very fitted. i think the detailing in the back would look better fitted. it made me look rather dowdy and/or matronly unlike how it looks on the model. i think that was because it was just too big. i returned it.
3 Despite other reviewers comments on size - i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it. i'm typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small. the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit i'd said for more for a b. (if i lifted my arms i would literally come out of it)
3 It's a pretty top with a lot of intricate detail and love the edge the studs give it but it looks fuddy duddy in ivory. looks nicer in black but you loose some of the detail in the dark color. the lace is not soft either but has more of a polyester, slightly scratchy feel. sizing is true to size and it fits well if the style floats your boat.
3 Ok so this top is as cute in person as it is online. runs very small as theres no stretch or give in fabric. i normally wear 12 and i couldnt even halfway get this on lol. i may consider a 14-16 but the stores didnt have this yet to try on. the ladies at the counter were crushing on this top though!if you can find your fit this top is great for layering!
3 This jacket is cozy, warm, and very cute, but after the 1st washing (according to the manufacturer's instructions) it began to pill and has worsened each time.
3 I love these pants -- bought them in the mustard color. my only complaint is that they are not colorfast -- i washed them in cold water with other colored items -- most of which belonged to my husband. not good -- and pretty much ruined an entire load of laundry except for these pants. retailer -- please color test your garments. there is really no excuse for fabrics like this to run in this day and age!
3 Beautiful blouse in theory, however, on my 5'9" frame it came off like a costume. i truly had a nice chuckle as i looked at myself in the mirror. had to sadly return it
3 Stylist in store warned be about issues with buttons falling of easily. loved the look, so bought it anyway. lost 2 buttons on the first wear. it did not feel snug on me, but i guess i could try a size up and see if the buttons hold a bit better. either way i will return or exchange.
3 Cropped and wide- would look cuter on someone who is more petite. was too wide and cropped for me. very sheer.
1 I saw this at the store today. very excited about it but i had no idea how to get it on! there is a side zipper so i attempted to step into the jumper through the collar but could never get my arms through! from what i could see on my body, it would have been too short in the crotch. i decided not to fight with it to put on entirely. i gave up. cute shade of green though.
1 No. this is one of the most unflattering things i've ever put on my body. i'm a very well-proportioned hourglass - i tend to wear a small despite a booty and 36d chest - this made me look huge. don't do it.
3 I tried this on at the store, and though it was pretty, i was a little underwhelmed. it fit but had no give so it might not have been too comfortable for movement unless sized up. the embroidered polka dots were a lovely idea, but the quality was not great - they were already fraying and pretty irregular looking. the idea of the top was better than the execution.
3 I wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors, but after only a few minutes of wearing them, i was having to pull them out of my bottom! why does women's underwear so frequently ride up? i normally wear a size 4/28, and ordered these in a m, but i guess they were still too small, which seems unreasonable to me. they are soft and pretty, but i will not be ordering more.
1 Very poorly made- wide and short, very unflattering. the material is advertised as cotton, but it felt very synthetic.
1 This dress is thin and completely see through. it is definitely not worth the price tag. would be really cute in a thicker material.
1 I bought a pair of these a month ago and first time i washed them they came out with light spots all down the leg. i figured i did something wrong so i bought another pair in the same color and one in sage. just washed both pairs according to care instructions (no spills, stain remover, or anything but detergent) and both came out with light spots all down the leg. very sad to have wasted all that money.
1 I was really disappointed in the shirt. the blue embroidery is a lot darker than what is shown in the photo, and barely stands out against the black. the photo does not accurately depict this shirt. i will be returning.
3 Cute but too thick and rough
1 This top was a big disappointment. i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size 16. neither of them fit well, but one was cut much smaller than the other. i've had this problem with all of the numerically-sized buttondown style of maeve tops. i don't understand why in size 14 & 16, this keeps happening. that's why i purchase two of each. usually one fits and the other doesn't. this time, unfortunately, neither worked. they both were too tight in the arms/shoulders
3 I wanted to love this top- the pink color is wonderful and vibrant. however, like many tops lately, it is short waisted and ended up looking a bit boxy. i am 5'8 and found it about 1-2 inches too short.
3 This is a really cute shirt. i love the design, color and everything about this shirt but the size. i am 5'1 and 105 lbs, i can usually wear an xs or xsp. the xs was huge and they were sold out of smaller sizes or i would have ordered one. this unfortunately had to go back.
1 I wore this suit for the first time yesterday and the black inner lining is leaking and causing stains on the white sections. seriously bummed as this is a super lovely suit.
1 I initially saw this top a few months ago, and fell in love. it ended up selling out in stores, so i ordered it online, where it was back-ordered by a couple of months. i received it this past week, and was sadly disappointed. the design is pretty, but overall the quality is sorely lacking. i wonder if maybe the first batch was good, but when they realized they were so popular, and had more made, the newer batches weren't as good? not sure. the one i got had inconsistent red embroidery, and ther
3 This dress is super cute - and fits tts for retailer. i ordered my usual size small and it fit me great everywhere, however the arms are much shorter and hit me either wrong, or the model in the picture is just very,very small. i'm 5'10, 136#, 36aa, slim built and the dress fits, but the arms bunch up -- if i ordered a medium the entire dress would be too baggy (and it is a loose fitting shift). bummer, bc it is super cute! also, the material is loose crochet - my dress arrived with a pull. sad fa
3 This dress could have been great but for me there was too much design on the top part/ front. i wish the neckline was different or just less beadwork/ design near my face.all in all its a maxi dress and was returned because approx. $250 was too much to spend on this.
3 I bought the red and white. both tank tops were a nice, thick material- definitely high quality. i was hoping there would just be a little bit of swing at the bottom, just enough to be loose and flattering. but there is a ton of extra fabric at the end, which with a larger bust wound up edging into looking a little maternity. but i think it'd be great on you if you tend to do well with very drapey or swingy tops. it runs a touch big- im normally between a small and an xs, and the xs was not even
3 This dress would have been perfect in a medium petite. beautiful dress, wish i had sized down
3 Loved the look of this top. sadly it runs quite small and was very tight where other non-swing tops in a large do not. the item ran out of stock far too quickly. i normally wear a large but feared that the large would be small and wanted to order up but it was already put of stock. the quality and style are great especially for a larger chest. length is great for taller women.
3 This is such a cute top with so much potential, soft fabric, vibrant colors and flattering fit on top. however like so many of retailer swing tops lately it has tons of fabric at the bottom making it billow in a very unflattering way. i ordered it in an xxsp so i can't even go down in size so this top, regrettably, has to go back.i love swing tops but retailer, could we please have tops that do not double for maternity tops??
3 I'm obsessed with this skirt and was so excited when it came in the mail. i ordered a m, and it was massive! i'm 5'9 and typically wear a 6 or an 8. as i don't really have much of a waist/am built more like a column, i wanted it to sit right at my waist/right under my ribs. wanted to wear a crop top with it, but it fell down to my hips which made me look significantly larger. the quality is amazing, and the skirt is even better looking in person! worth ordering in a size down and getting it tail
3 This dress is beautiful. very vibrant and rich looking...however, after wearing it to work the back of the dress was completely stretched out from sitting in my office chair. when i stood up a little bubble remained around my butt. not attractive. i wanted to love it but it's going back.
3 I like the feel, stretch and softness of this dress, it's very comfortable. sadly, as others have commented, the armhole openings are just too long causing the dress to fit and look a little off around the chest area on me. i considered sizing down to a 4, but it fit beautifully other than the armhole area. unfortunately it will have to go back. i am 5'7",120 lbs, 34d and ordered a 6.
1 Pants are overpriced and very uncomfortable. to my utter dismay i wore them during a business trip for the first time and ended up with bruises caused by the side zipper. i have been a long time retailer shopper and usually my go to store, however,ending up with a pair of pants that caused me pain was a very big disappointment,
1 I wanted to love this top -- looks so comfy and cute. but hangs like a bag. going back!
1 I am normally a straightforward 10 - since i saw the other review i ordered down to an 8 - i am still swimming in it.i would say i have about 4 inches of extra fabric in the waist/hips. this is sized way too large. i love the softness of the checkers but i suspect this could get itchy fast on the arms where it touches the wool - but i won't find out cause i'm returning it?on the bright side i might fit a 6 which would be pretty nice.
3 Great cut and fit. tts. size 6 fit my 5'5", 135 pound frame (34b/c bust) wonderfully. my sister and best friend loved it on. but i'm returning. the color is more of a very bright orange than red. i would want to wear this in the middle of summer but the all-polyester fabric is hot. i have too many dresses in my closet. cute as it is, i'd just never pick this one. love to see this design in lighter fabric and different color options. 1-2" longer would also be a slightly better length.
1 This dress is absolutely hideous on my physique. ordered a size 6 and it hung on me like a cheaply made tent. i have an athletic built am a 34d. it is going back asap.
3 I purchased these on sale and am only keeping them because they were such a low price. i ordered the 2 petite, but they do not actually seem to be made for a petite person. they are still very long (to my ankles) and the legs are very wide. the waist fits fine though.
1 Even on sale sale...this tank is not worth the money. the design in the back is adorable & would expect it to be so much better quality but the fabric is flimsy(think old man white tanks that come in a pack) completely see through and lack of shape..i wanted to love this but definitely photographed significantly better than actuality!
3 I saw this dress in the store months ago and never forgot it, so when i saw it on sale i nabbed it online. so sad to see how this dress fits: just right up top, just right along the hem, and then it's a hot, potato-sack-frump mess in the middle. it's a shame because the fabric is beautiful.
3 Definitely size down, the waist and chest were baggy in my normal size s.
3 This a heavy cotton which is great for fall. design is cute and pockets are interesting. the fit is boxy and can look bulky. i only recommend if it's on sale.
3 This dress looks so beautiful on the model and i couldn't resist ordering it on-line. i have an athletic build -- read small hips -- straight. i'm 5'5' and 135 lbs. i was very disappointed when i put on. it's made for a curvy build. the dress was just too big, especially around the hips. i think this dress is probably beautiful on a curvier build!
1 This dress turned out to be a huge disappointment!!! i was in loveee with the picture! in real life, not so much. the material felt thin and cheap! and the yellow was super yellow! nothing like the picture. i was so bummed! returned it earlier today...
3 I purchased this dress to wear to a beach wedding. i loved the color, the fit and the style. i even got a lot of compliments on it. the problem was that the wedding was on the beach, in florida 85 degree weather and when you are sweating the fabric changes colors and takes a really really long time to return to normal! unfortunately i had to return it. would be great to wear indoors, just watch getting water or anything else on it!
3 It's okay for a coverup or beach dress and lounging around the house. it's comfy and i like the detail of the back. the front is very plain but okay. it's not too baggy and it's a straight cut. the detail in the back makes it a keeper for me but only as a casual dress too chill at home or quick errands to grocery store.
3 This shirt runs large. i ordered it before it was sold in stores so i didn't return it. the style is really cute. the shirt does pill.
3 I bought this dress to wear to my low-key backyard rehearsal dinner. the dress it's self is beautiful, good quality, and a perfect summer maxi. however, it was way too big. i'm 5'6, 118 lbs, i typically wear an xs/0 and felt like i was swimming in fabric. i loved the style and make of the dress, so i choose to get it tailored.
3 I love the look of this dress and the material - the problem is that when i tried it on the fit was a bit off. it seems that the arm holes hung down way too much and pulled the dress so it is uncomfortable to wear. i don't think i could have gone down or up a size to make this dress work. it is a shame because i really liked the look of it.
3 Too floppy; light and comfortable material but the tie-neck needs a shirt with a bit more structure.
3 I was really excited about this romper and when it arrived it looks just like the picture. the torso was abnormally long and i get this is supposed to be a relaxed fit but it sagged way too much for my liking. i'm 5'9", 32c and i wear 28 size pants, usually i struggle with too short of a torso in romper/jumpsuits but not this one. i ordered a medium and felt like it was way too big. i probably could have gone down a size but i wasn't loving it enough to try. the fabric is nice but the tiny clasp
3 I can usually be counted on to love a pretty top with lace detail and a bit of flow. this one has those qualities but it does not look great on me. perhaps it is too flowy because i am 5?3. or possibly the fabric is too soft a look on me. i did size down as reviewers suggested. maybe one size was not enough :-). i must return it.
3 This top is very light and soft for summer. even the lace is soft. it's not sheer and doesn't require layering. true to size. i'm 5'4", 34dd, 150 lbs- m fits well. my arms are not tiny and yet the lace weren't tight for me. but the quality of the material is average and it feels like it will last barely one summer. it's good if you are paying the sale price.
3 Love everything about this skirt but the sizing. i'm a size 6/medium in almost everything but this skirt swallowed me. i wise there was a small or even extra small to try out. i'm also 5'5 and the skirt was right at my knees. definitely size down if you want it to look like the pictures.
1 I loved the idea behind this shirt but it just hangs around the waist with tons of extra fabric. i suspect the model in the photo has the shirt pinned. totally unflattering making the chest look small and your midsection appear huge. maybe if you size down it would be better- xs was not available for me to try. also the lavender color is really washed out...
3 Adorable top, but i have to agree with what two other reviewers said... that is is boxy and unflattering. i have a similar patterned top, also by maeve, but the sizing on that runs small, medium, large. the s petite that i have doesn't fit quite the same as the 4 petite in this blouse. this is definitely more "square" in the torso, and the ruffles do stick out more - very flouncy. it just made me look frumpy instead of the sexy date night look i was going for. i am 5' and 120 lbs. also, i didn't
3 I ordered this in an xs, which is my normal size in retailer tops. the stitching and detail on the straps is beautiful, but they were also somewhat tight across my bust and across my back. it puckered in a strange way that wasn't flattering. back it goes, unfortunately.
3 I was looking for a basic tee, but this one was just ok...the quality is okay, but it us not as soft as i would have liked. unfortunately,  i will be returning this item.
3 This top was quite voluminous when i purchased it and i sized down to an xs, however after hand washing it once in cold water it has shrunk significantly. it still fits, but something to be aware of.
3 I know this is supposed to be a loose, flowy fit which is exactly the style i love. however, this is beyond tent-like. i'm 40 weeks pregnant and i can probably fit two of me in my normal size small. fabric is very thin and pattern looks like drab wallpaper. huge bummer, especially after seeing a few 5-stars.
3 I purchased this dress online and it just didn't fit my body very well. it also arrived with a pretty sizeable hole so i can't say that i'm impressed with the quality. there were other areas too where was a loose thread which i'm sure will develop into another hole eventually. returned.
3 I saw these in my local retailer and loved them on the hanger. when i tried them on, not so much. the material is a pretty substantial white denim and very stretchy (i didn't find them to be that smooth of a fabric, but more of a traditional denim texture). i am a 6-8 in pants, and normally wear a 27 in pilcro denim. when i tried on the size 27 in the store, i found them to be very tight in the thighs - and i don't have big thighs. i also found the pants to pull conspicuously across the crotch are
3 There is a lot of fabric here! the legs fit me fine, but they are long and when you roll them up it creates a bunching of fabric in an awkward area. i've also found that they don't stay rolled up in the back, especially if you sit down. it's a shame since the fabric is soft and comfortable. maybe sizing down would've helped, but i doubt that would've fixed the problem of the cuffs staying rolled up.
3 I'm 5'7", 135 lbs, slender bone structure. the medium fit well in the front but hung to the back of knees in back...just way too long. it would work best on someone closer to 6' tall.
1 I'm so disappointed this dress didn't work out! i ordered the size medium, post baby i'm a solid dress size 6 or 8 depending on the designer.the cashier was laughing with me how ridiculously huge this garment was when i held it up. also the length was super long, description says 35" which would be mid thigh for me, but this thing hit me mid knee. also, like the previous review the shoulders are tented and poofy. so bizarre and the cut reminds me of a maternity dress, but the shoulders def
1 I'm 5'7" 155lbs and ordered a large. it fit, but the arms were awkwardly short. the finish details on the end of each sleeve almost would have to be pushed back to the elbow for it to look right, which would be okay. however, the interior seam of the neckline is cut jaggedly and isn't even finished with any stitching. it's just tucked haphazardly inside the neckline and isn't sewn--it would unravel with washing. it's soft and snuggly and cute if you get it on super-sale and don't mind it com
3 I wish i could keep this dress based on the pretty orange print and style but the fabric and details make this a return, even on sale price :( agree with previous reviews: bodice too tight, neckline too high/chokes, fabric is rough, outer is poorly attached to liner so it poofs in weird areas. too bad...so sad!
1 Dress is nice but can't be worn without tights or you are at a risk of indecently exposing yourself. it is around 30" in length so is more of a tunic than a dress. i'm only 5'1 and it was too short . can't imagine anyone taller even trying to wear this !
3 This skirt and top is nothing like the picture. the skirt is black not maroon. top is also black. although the skirt is nice, the image was fabulous. the side panels of the skirt are also a knit. quality is good but skirt is overpriced for what it is. would have expected suede or leather panels for the money. not sure if going to keep or not. was really looking for the maroon color instead of the black.
3 This top is very nice. i ordered it in black, it looked very good. the embroidery and pleated details give it a very nice look. the fabric, however, feels like heavy cotton. it didn't feel very soft and comfortable, it was a bit hard for me to wear because i usually prefer soft cotton. while i think this will retain it's shape and not stretch like softer cotton, i am sending it back. it felt a bit heavy to wear.
3 I ordered this shirt in the purple stripe and was happy when it arrived and i really liked the color and style.   however, like the other reviewer, when i tried it on, the little circles on the front line up perfectly with your bra straps.  i even tried a different style bra and had the same result.  sadly i returned it yesterday.
3 I love these leggings - they look and feel great, but i can't wear them out of the house! there is no elastic in the waistband, so they are constantly falling down. i won't dare wear them out, for fear they will fall down when i walk across the street. everything else about the leggings is exactly what i was looking for: style, comfort, and warmth. they are great for curling up to read a good book in front of the fire; not for doing anything active.
3 This truly is a dress and not a tunic. i normally wear a medium but they were sold out so i thought i would try a l petite. i am only 5'4 and the large p was really long. i could definitely wear as a dress with tights. i am hoping it comes back in stock so i can try a medium p. unfortunately it is going back. cute sweater as pictured on the model!
3 I am sure these pants are right for someone, just not me. i am wider in the hips, and they just were really unflatering. the fabric is very lightweight, which i wasn't expecting, and so while the pleats are interesting, with my hips they ended up hitting in just the wrong place. the waist was also much lower than i expected -- not low rise, but i'm used to thinking high waist with wide legs. in short, these pants are probably great on some body types, just not mine. also very long. i'm 5-8 and a
3 I was so excited for this coat when i saw it in the catalog, but disappointed when it got to stores. the faux fur pictured both here and in the catalog looked much more of a burnt red brown color than the straight up maroon that it actually is in store. i'd say it even looks a bit purple. the nice thing is that it is detachable and you can replace it with something else if you really don't like the color. i have decided to buy it anyways because the fit of the coat is lovely and simply stunning.
1 Unfortunately, does not look anything like in the picture. looks like an oversized house robe. i expected much more but was disappointed. i am definitely returning it.
3 I am 5'4" about 120# with an athletic build. i was so excited for this dress to arrive. when i removed it from the package i loved the way it felt and the weight of it. the color was as pictured on my computer. i ordered the xsp and was concerned it would be too small in the shoulders or too short. it was huge on me -- too long -- too wide -- too frumpy -- too loose all over. i checked to make certain it was a petite that was sent and it was. boo. i do like the cap sleeve better than the flutter
3 First, i was surprised that this skirt fabric felt similar to men's tie.  it is a thick weight silky feel.  next, i was surprised by the cut.... i wear a 12/14 petite, and the waist of the large is at least a size 10 if not smaller.  finally, the length was really long.  i realize i am 5'2 and buying non-petite sizes, but the cut was high ankle on me. i like the pattern and ruffles of fabric, both are unusual and good for fall/winter.  but i did not like the rest.
1 Thought this would be great for a laid-back wedding in new mexico, but didn't fit. i am a 12-14 and the 14 barely fit my chest and arms. not flattering. material did not seem very breakthable. had to return. better luck next time.
3 I bought this mostly to wear around the house, so i'll keep it because i got it on a pretty good sale.that said, this runs really large. the sleeves are really loose, and it doesn't really hang well over my hips, which is a shame. it's very soft and cozy, which is nice, but i don't think i'll leave the house in it often. it also arrived with a hole in the ribbing on the bottom of the front panel. i was able to tie a knot through one of the loops that i think will prevent further unraveling, bu
1 I ordered these twice just to be sure there wasn't a glitch. the color is so off! the picture shows a dark blue denim, but they are not they are a light blue - with whiskering! retailer you need to have a better image of the color because this is so misleading.
3 This is a pretty dress. i bought a size 0 and the body of the dress fit, however, the sleeves were too long. had to return, as the loose and longer sleeves made the dress look too big on me.
3 I want to love this shirt but it isn't happening. the proportions shown on the model are not how this shirt ends up fitting. the fabric is super soft and the pattern is great, if the fit works for you.
3 This dress is beautiful in person, the details on it are amazing. the only problem i had was that it ran small. i am usually an 8 or 10 in retailer dresses, but had to size up to a 12 just to be able to breath. the top on the 10 was tight in the chest and arms. when i sized up to the 12 there was more room, but not by much. the embroidery detail on the dress is the best part, it is exactly as shown in the picture. plus it has pockets which is always a plus for me. lightweight and great for warm we
3 I love these shorts, very pretty and well made, but if you have any kind of muscle in your thighs, beware, not as flattering as on the model a9dn probably previous reviewer). shorts hit at hte widest part of my leg, creating a weird tent effect around the area. waist was true to sizw and i can only imagine how beautiful they would be on "skinny" legs.
3 These pants are adorable as pajamas or maybe something very casual to wear to the beach, but they honestly do not seem like something that a grown woman would wear in public. they are good quality and fit nicely, but i feel like if you're over 20, they're not really flattering or especially appropriate.
3 First, i absolutely love cloth & stone. but lately i'm finding some of the styles are going in a direction that just doesn't fit my style. that's ok because they still have some good basics. what i mean is the cut. a lot of their pieces are super long in the back and super short in the front (ie their slip dress they have out right now). this particular tank is like that, although this one is borderline. the sides cut up a little too high for my tastes and i can't help but think i'm wearin
3 Love the shape and cut of this top but it is so sheer you could see my belly button through it. if it was a dark color i would buy it. wore my regular size small. i'm 5'5"130lbs  and 32dd.
3 The blouse was not flattering on me. it would be for someone with a straight slim body type, it falls mid hips and so it accentuates my hips making them look larger. it's flared so it cannot really be tucked in.
3 I like the quality of material of this top but it's too long and wide for my frame. the high neck feels odd for my broad shoulders. too bad as i really wanted to love this.
3 This is a beautiful lined jacket, with a much more structured fit than a typical kimono. it hit me at the high hip, not low hip as shown on the model. given how structured it is, i don't think the "one size" will work for anyone larger than a small if you want a drapey kimono fit.
3 Very pretty, romantic
1 Loved the look of this sweater online. was disappointed when i took it out of the package i was surprised at how stiff and itchy it was. i ordered my usual medium and though at first they shipped the wrong size it was small all over.  it felt cheep definelty not worth the high price. knew it was definitely going back
3 These are my first paige cords/pants and they seem to run much smaller than the other brands i wear. i'm normally a 32 in all other brands but with these the waist is pretty tight. i do love the length (i'm 5'9 and they are plenty long.) i also love the bell/flare. i'm not sure what makes this brand so much more expensive as the quality though nice seems comparable to cheaper brands.
3 This fabric of this top is gorgeous. however, i'm 5' 5" and it hits in a really weird spot. right no the point of the hip that you don't want to accentuate. you could wear it with leggings to a casual thing, but i work in an office so its too short to wear with leggings and too long to wear with jeans. sad, i love the top 90% of it.
1 3 tags sewn in, 2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however, this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!
3 I didn't have any problems with the fit, i love the puffin pattern, the material is nice---it's just so short. i really haven't decided if the print is worth the awkwardness of the length, or if i'll just keep it and only wear it when it's cool enough outside to wear a tank under it, so i can avoid flashing my stomach every time i lift my arms. but, yeah...it stops right at my waist in front. way too short--stop making these great shirts so short, please.
3 This shirt is adorable, love the lace detail on the sides, but way too boxy for me. it's a great lighter weight for spring, but it doesn't feel flimsy. sadly, there isn't any shape to help make this flattering. it will be returned.
3 This is the prettiest little sweater with such nice details. but it will not work well on a person like me with a full bust (38d) even in a larger size than i normally wear. it is also very, very short in the body. i would recommend it for a petite person with a small bust though.
3 I really liked the style of this top but it's way oversized! i'm petite and drowned in this top even though i got it in an xs. the material is nice but i can't see i had a feeling for the cut because it runs so big. this one is going back to the store!
3 I was so excited to see this yellow dress online but was disappointed with the color when it arrived. the yellow us much darker than pictured. i felt the dress ran true to size but if you're short you definitely want to go with petite sizes.
3 Nice dress, you can wash it, i got black in med. i am 8-10 in tops and it is perfect, brand new is beautiful not sure how it will look after wash. great design. i wish it would be lighter material. material is very thick and heavy for a short sleeve dress. probably will stretch when you sit in car driving. i will be returning it for that reason, too heavy for summer .
1 This shirt had an overpowering vinegar odor when i took it out of the packaging.the mint green color was appealing but the styling did not look good and the smell was too much.
3 I was so excited to receive this romper. it's a great material, but it's actually a bit drab. the colors are very bland and the flowers just hang. it's not flattering as it is very roomy.
1 Poor quality, material looks much thinner and cheaper than pictured.
1 This dress looks nothing like the photo. the sequins are dull, no sheen at all. the faux leather panels and straps look and feel like cheap, shiny plastic. i didn't even try it on, because it was so hideous, when i pulled it out of the box. not remotely worth the price and wouldn't buy it on sale for $20 either. skip.
3 Fyi to help with sizing i am 5'7" weigh 134 lb and like things loose fitting but the medium was too big and sack like. dress is cute and the color is true to photo.
3 I'm 5'4", usually a small in retailer sizes, 6-8 pants, i purchased the 8 petite
3 So small! i was a solid size 12 in skirts but recently lost some weight. i was still nervous to buy a size 10 so i bought the 12 thinking i can always take it in if i have to. the 12 - which should have been big on me was tiny. this skirt is built for someone with non-existent hips. returning.
3 I was so excited to find this dress in the store! i immediately headed for the dressing room to try this beauty on....what a disappointment. the fabric is stunning, but the fit is extremely voluminous . i am normally a small to medium, so i grabbed a small......the only way to describe this dress is tentlike!  it was huge from the waist down. i don't think i could size to an xs because i am a 34d and the top half of the dress fit perfect!  i was sad to leave the store without this dress.
3 Beautiful dress, but it just didn't look that flattering on me. the quality was nice and it looked just like the picture. unfortunately it just looked shapeless on me so i had to return it. the dress is probably more flattering if you have long legs to show off, i definitely don't!
3 I wanted to love these pants since i hate super-fitted skinny pants. but they are really oversized. i'm 125lbs and 5 foot 2. so i'm petite but not considered skinny and have well endowed thighs and legs.but the xs was way too big for me.
3 Nice fabric, very versatile but the knit top and style accentuates your bust. probably not an issue for most but if your a d or up it's more attention than you may want.
3 I loved the look of the dress. it's a very flattering design. however, i absolutely hate the side zipper. every time i have worn it, the zipper will get stuck and it is a struggle to get it up. the side tie is a very cute touch, but you definitely have to figure out the best way to tie it, so you don't have a huge bump of fabric on your back. having said all this, i still did get a lot of compliments from this dress. i do wish the dress had a lining.
3 This shirt is thin and probably not worth full price, but it was flattering to my figure. covered my post baby tummy and complimented/minimized my g size chest, but the cut was off. the seams for the arms were almost in the front at the chest, so when i moved my arms i had limited movement forward and it pushed the embroidered panel out and was just irritating. an entire day of readjusting my shirt would drive me crazy. i tried the m and the l.
3 The dress arrived with two large buttons missing from the front complete with unraveling threads. the rest of the buttons are sewn on loosely, and in general, it's poor quality. ridiculous considering the price, very disappointed.
3 I ended up returning it just because it didn't do much for my current postnatal figure, but otherwise this top is just so pretty and unique!
3 If the sweater looked as it does in the picture, i would keep it. however, it was very boxy and short, a style that does not work for me at all. i'm 5 ft. 6 in. and ordered the medium. i suspect the sweater on the model may be clipped back to make it look more form fitting. unfortunately i will have to return the sweater.
3 This dress is well made and of good quality it just looked a little too old on me. the skirt was heavy and the fabric was cozy, perfect for a fall outfit.
3 I desperately wanted this to work - it's a beautiful color and overall quality...it is just so short and wide (almost a perfect square if you lay it out flat). i can see it looking better on someone on the shorter side, but on my 5'7" frame and long torso it just didn't look right. few extra inches and this could have been awesome!
3 The dress is great for pear shapes. however, i do feel it runs larger than typical retailer sizing. ordered a small (5'8" 140#) and i still think it may be a bit big. the material is very comfortable, not too thick or thin. however, i feel the shaping on the bottom is a little bulky due to the fabric. see the attached photo.
3 I was really looking forward to getting this dress in the orange print, but when i finally received, i was a little disappointed. the print placement is not the same as shown on the model, so it doesn't look as a vibrant and colorful. my version of the dress has more of that muddy dark print and hardly any orange or turquoise. also the backside of the print is white and the dress is not lined. i do like the way it drapes on my body and the overall styling. the dress fits nicely in size medium on
3 I like the look of this tee and the fit is fine but it's described as a "cotton-rayon jersey" and in fact it's 50% polyester. i would not have ordered if i had known and now have to take it back.
3 Online this top looks fabulous, but in person, not so great. great color, nice quality for a lightweight top, but when i tried it on, the neck does not lay nicely. too much sloppy wrinkled material just hanging awkwardly around the neck ( and i love cowl neck). i found, for me, it dipped very low showing cleavage and i have a large chest, so didn't work. for reference, i'm 5'4 118 and usually wear a small in retailer tops because it seems the majority of their clothes run large. i purchased a smal
3 I really liked the top once i saw it, but it needs to be worn with a cami underneath. the fabric is a little stiff. it runs true to size and it fits like a peplum top with extra space around the waist. the top is not really crocheted by hand it was done by machine, but it is a nice top.
3 I have been looking for flares that are not tight through the thigh and these are definitely them...but for me they were so long that to hem them would ruin the style of the pants. i'm 5'5 and have long legs but i would need a high heel to maintain the intended style, and that's not what i was looking for. otherwise, beautiful.
1 I am sorry to say this blouse is way below all retailer standards. this top should have been placed on sale a long time ago! poor quality in cut, fabric, design. this is a top one would grab at a local box store for 19.99. the colors are not as vibrant. the shoulders ill fitted. and the fabric and threads are very cheap. i was expecting so much more.sorry retailer.....my favorite store to shop!
3 I love the style and color of this jumpsuit. i ordered a petite, and with tall shoes, it's still about 3" too long. the side seam needs to be taken out at the bottom to hem it, so that's a pain in the rear. also, this has a side zipper, but you step through the neckline to put it on. if any part of me was even a tiny bit larger, this would never work. the biggest issue is that it armholes/bust gaps a lot. there should have been a dart from the armhole down towards the bust. i'm hoping to be
3 The material is super soft and i could see how this could be a great fall sweater, but the furry portion made the top too bulky. i should've sized down, but even then i think it still would've been a touch boxy. if it was boxy all the way through it'd be fine, but it feels like just the top was bulky while the bottom half was fine. perhaps good for more broad shouldered people. i have very small shoulders. also reminded me too much of a sheepskin rug.
3 I wanted to love this turtleneck. i read the reviews before ordering. i love the color, the weight of the knit, the ribbing. the small fit me perfectly; i am a 34b, not broad shouldered, and on the thin side in my upper body. however, this item has a strange "blousy" fit. the picture of the back view hints at this but it's worse in person. it's like a bell shaped top or even slightly trapezey, which simply doesn't work with my shape. plus, i'm long waisted. i could have made this work had it not
1 The fabric of this vest is identical to a old white dish cloth! the cut of this vest is also bad! will be sent back!
3 So  disappointed that no where in the limiting did it mention this suit is australian in size!! i ordered the 10 (i'm usually an 8 but that was sold out) and the suit arrives and doesn't even fir over my hips. -- the label clearly says 10 australian us 6!  gutted that i have to return this suit because of this sizing issue.  the suit looks to be well made and the design is adorable of it only for.
3 This is a cute top that is very soft and comes in nice colors. it's body hugging, but not clingy. i'm 5'5" 120 with square shoulders and a longer torso, and when i initially tried a small i thought it looked ok, but when i tried on the extra small it looked much better. the way the top is cut it fits a bit weird under the arms, as you can see in the photos, but it wasn't enough to keep me from picking up a few colors when it went on sale. i like wearing this under a jacket or cardigan with jeans
3 I loved everything about this shirt except the harm holes are oddly large. i tried on a medium and the arm holes were very large so i thought a small would fit better but it didn't, the fabric is beautiful and the diamond pattern looks amazing up close but i decided to return the top because the arm holes just stuck out so awkwardly.
3 I am torn about this dress. the print is very pretty and the fabric has a gentle flow to it. the top part is great but the portion below the chest reminded me of a tent. it is tricky to pull off if you are well-endowed on the top or wear a padded bra. i liked the look better when i tied it at the back with the ultra-thin belt straps which gave some shape to the waist. i agree with the other reviewer that a slim person could carry the look well. i usually don't return online purchases unless they
3 I got my normal size and unfortunately the moment i tried it on the details on both shoulders ripped. the dress fit fine and i basically have no boobs so i don't think it was a case of it being too small. i guess it just wasn't reinforced enough. there was also a miss-stitch in the shoulder on the back which causes the back of the dress to bunch funnily. lastly, there's a slip on the inside which i don't think was necessary. it hugs tight to the body and makes the whole dress feel oddly clingy.
3 Liked the netting around the collar but the whole blouse was very baggy. order size down.
3 This is a pretty dress, although it runs smaller and the colors aren't as vibrant as on the website. the waist ran very small for me in a size 10 which is my normal size and normally runs looser in the waist area as i have an hour glass figure. this probably will look very nice on someone smaller.
3 This dress was cute but the fit was not quite right. the bottom half fit well but the top half was a little loose. it was wearable but i was worried after wearing for a few hours it would stretch out even more and look frumpy. like other reviewers have said, this dress really needs a belt to bring it together. i ended up returning it because i didn't love it.
3 This is a cute blouse. i get lots of compliments. i bought the natural color. super flattering. i bought my normal size in most retailer stuff and had to return for bigger. the chest area is a bit snug. had to send back for a larger size.
3 This is a beautiful fabric and the skirt is so nice. what is wrong is the cut of the skirt. one side bells out more than the other, giving it an off center look from the front. my legs were not centered.
1 I love the idea of this shirt, but the execution is absolutely horrible. i ordered online and what i received is just a mess. the stitching at the bottom has big globs of black thread. not just a few hanging off, but literally big clumps. a large portion of the stitching on the whole shirt looks like it should be on the underside of the shirt as the where the thread is tied off is on the outside!! the fit is just as big a mess. i always have to buy a large in fitted shirts because i have very br
1 This shirt was great for one wear. after just one wash (followed instructions to dry clean) it lost all shape and now hangs like a bed sheet. terrible waste of money on a pricey top.
3 The top as with most of ap's tops is well stitched. material is very uncomfortable. if you have large bust it is a little divulging. this may prompt you to wear something underneath to look modest and change the shape of the top!
3 I fell in love with this dress online. i listened to the reviews and ordered a size up. i got it in the mail and couldn't wait to try it on! i was sad that to find, that while it was tight across the chest and the keyhole in the back seemed to pull, it was really large in the body. in addition, while the lace is beautiful it is very fragile. i still think this is a great dress but definitely for someone who is small chested. for reference i am a 32dd and size 2-4 and i ordered a medium.
3 I ordered this in hopes of wearing as a tunic with leggings for my rehearsal dinner. it is much shorter than expected and wouldn't have looked right with leggings. it also was more gray than ivory and in the short time i had it on was shedding lint like crazy. beautiful in photos but didn't work for me.
3 I ordered the pink in size xl. the color was pretty. the problem is the material was too thin and tight. it ran at least a size smaller than shown in the photos online.
3 There were no reviews when i ordered this tunic so nothing to help gauge fit. it is very cute but the fit is strange - very narrow in the shoulders and chest.
1 I wanted to like this top so so so so badly. so badly in fact, that after the first size didn't fit, i ordered two other sizes to make sure: xl, l, m. none of them worked i really wanted to like this top. the online photo makes the clothing look so flattering and the shirt is just not....at least on me. the shirt online on the model looks slimming and a lot longer than the actual piece of the clothing. the beaded work is very beautiful, but short causing the very poofy peplum to start at the mos
3 I really like the pattern and the cut of these pants. the fabric is nice, too. however, i was disappointed how much they stretched out the first (and only) time i wore them. i am 5'6" and about 150 lbs. i ordered size 10; i am going to try to exchange them for a size 8 since they stretched so much.
3 After the reviews about sizing, i ordered the size 16 (am normally size large). interestingly, the tag on the blouse says it's a 14. with all that said, the blouse is cute enough and sizing up gave me enough length (in spite of the higher sides) that i'm considering keeping it. although it's a bit big, it flows nicely and isn't oversized in that wide, crazy way. the sleeves are a bit too big but they're cuffed with a button and can be rolled. the fabric is somewhat crinkled in texture. i got the
3 I love the look of this pullover, however, it was too short and heavy for my small frame with narrow shoulders. sleeves were too long as well.
3 I loved this jumpsuit. it fit well on my curvier/athletic frame. i did prefer a belt, which emphasized my shape. unfortunately, it is not lined and a bit sheer. this was a deal breaker for me.
3 I'm tall (5'11" and busty) and found this top to run on the short side. as others have said, the material is soft and stretchy, but the rouching created a bit of a bulky look. i returned it.
3 I have been a big fan of this canadian designer so when i saw the sweater on the web, i immediately ordered it. on the website, it looks very modern and edgy chic. i was heartbroken when i saw it in person. when i opened the bag and put on the sweater, i noticed a lot of little black marks on the bathroom floor. it came from the sweater. size small was swimming on me and the holes on the shoulders, which supposed to look modern...well, the thin cheap material the sweater looks like it's ripped.
3 The image online doesn't depict this blouse well.. my complaint is that the sweater portion looks crooked and shrunken where it has been cut at waist level and the ruffles have been attached at the hips. maybe i received a flawed piece, either way, i'll be sending it in for return.
3 Love this top , although it ran very small in bust and arms , i'm normally a medium will have to return for a large!
3 I wanted to love this dress so much, but unfortunately it ran way too big for my taste. i am usually a 4/6 in retailer, and the small was huge on me. the bottom half of the dress is very much a "swing" dress and is very wide, much wider than it looks in the pictures. i suppose that sizing down (maybe even to a petite), and having the dress altered to be narrower on the bottom half would've made it look like the picture, but that's a lot of extra work for a dress that is already pretty pricey.
3 This was pretty to look at: nice weight, lining, colors. i tried it on and whoa. ridiculously bad. i have broad shoulders and a small waist and this accentuated the broadness of my shoulders and eliminated any hint of shape below that. the model photo looks great, so i imagine this will look great on anyone with slim shoulders and narrow hips. definitely not for me, though...
3 The fit is slightly loose, but figure flattering, the fabric is semi sheer and the light, coral color is very pretty. however, after one, short wear i discovered fabric torn from both sides of the back seam. unfortunately, i need to return this blouse asap.
3 This shirt is really cute and runs large. i am a true s and this shirt came as big as what i would call an l.i get that its a boyfriend t-shirt feel but it was still surprising. if you're an s i suggest xxs and so forth.the color is yellow but not as yellow as the picture shows.
3 Yes, i bought this dress in anticipation of wearing it right away. it's not mean for everybody. it would look good on a stick figure. if you have some hips, they balloon out.
3 I read the reviews before i bought this dress and had trouble believing that the dress literally fell apart at the seams so i bought it. first the good: i love the color, the fabric, and the design. it's very lightweight and loose-fitting and is perfect for hot days. the neck and sleeves are pretty on. i can wear it as a cover up or put on a necklace and sandals for everyday errands and things.now the bad: it literally falls apart at the seams as you take it out of the package! i"m surprised a
1 Retailer has incredible service, and so they let me return this dress even after having worn it. however, this dress cannot be cleaned. i saw a stain on it after the first use, so i first tried hand washing it. however, the black part of the dress came off on the white part, making the stain worse. i then tried dry cleaning it (the care tag allows both) and that produced 3 or 4 new stains where the black rubbed off on the white. it's a beautiful, striking dress (that would be great maternit
1 Beware! there is a reason this sweater is on sale. it is not even remotely the same color as pictured. instead of the lovely antique blue in the photo, this sweater is a faded, boring, teal-green. what a huge disappointment.
3 I thought i would take a chance even though reviews suggested tricky sizing issues. unfortunately it's true, it was very tight at the waist and bust even though i sized up to a size 8. i took it back to the store.
1 I should have paid closer attention to the other reviews. i could barely get this blouse over my head! after getting it on, the armholes too are very small. the blouse other than that is pretty and very girlie. i love the pleating and dolman sleeves but i was strangled around my neck. i tried the small but think a medium wouldn't have been much better. it needs a button opening on neck and sleeves. i would have to put this on before makeup or doing my hair. if you have a tiny head and pencil a
1 Wow this is huge! i'm all for the tent-look with the right style, but this was absurd. i could have fit two of me into the width, and with the peplum style, extra width doesn't flatter anyone. the fabric is also so thin that it doesn't hang nicely, it kind of floats around the body. if you want a wide top, then this is perfect, but if you wanted something that hangs nicely, look elsewhere. i purchased a petite s, my typical size.
3 It's a perfectly cute simple summer dress, but the only reason i'm even considering keeping it is because it was a gift. the material is fine but for this price, i expect something more exciting than what is, really, just a modified t-shirt dress. at least more exciting colors or a print or something. the top piece is 2 full layers which could get warm in the summer, and the ribbing is tight enough that you have to wear a bra even if you're small-chested (i'm a 32b and super thin and still neede
1 The fabric of this looks and feels so cheap it's hard to believe this is anna sui. i would say this is unwearable. there is zero stretch and it is made of itchy textured poly fabric that looks like novelty fabric at best. going back asap.
3 I am a curvy size 8. i loved the colors but found it looked maternity when unbelted and there was too much bunchy fabric at the waist when tied. i tend to like things that emphasize my waist, however.
3 I received this dress today for a june wedding. i was so excited about it and the quality is beautiful but unfortunately i am going to have to return it. it runs very big. i normally like to wear items a bit bigger/baggier but with this dress it needs to be tight on the sides. bummer :(
1 I was so excited to order this dress. i loved that it had a normal neck, nice length, and there wasn't a hole in the back. but this dress is just plain awful. the top fit tight across the bust, it flattened me out like i was wearing a too tight sports bra. then the back zipper puckered and bumped up like there is too much zipper for the fabric. i could not get the zipper to lay flat. the fabric is itchy and very cheap feeling. on top of it all the colors are much brighter than they appear in the
3 More importatn, super soft matieral and comfortbale, hwoever, when i put it on, ilfelt like i was wearing a robe... i do like the detial in the fabric, but jsut dind't feel right as cardigan. maybe purchase if you are looking for a light robe.true to size, tried on xs, maybe petite would work too.
3 I wanted to love this dress. i went into retailer in sb to try it on and when i saw it on the rack it looked beautiful, both the print and the material. then i tried it on and it fit like a tent. i am just under 5'5 and it hit right below my knees, not like shown in the picture here. on that note, i passed on this one due to the fit. i think this would make a fantastic maternity dress though.
3 It does run large as most reviewers noted. i opted for the pxs and it was still very large and the way that the elastic at the top hit me it bunched funny and made my chest look huge and i'm only a b cup. it added a good two cup sizes to my chest and it just looked odd. the length of the petite was good for me at only 5'4" so the length did not overwhelm but the width was still really too wide. love the fabric and the lace at the hemline. it just wasn't for me but for those it works for it is be
3 This fit well, but the top was very see through. this never would have worked for me. i'm glad i was able to try it on in the store and didn't order it online. with different fabric, it would have been great.
3 I really wanted to like this top, but couldn't seem to find the right fit. i tried it on in 3 different sizes and none of them were right - they were either too wide in the hips, or a little narrow in the shoulder. it is cute overall though - and a good way to do a short top, without feeling like you're in a "crop top"
1 Bought the dress online and it only has an eye and hook at the top. the waist has no stretch and their isn't a zipper. you have to be a contortionist to get it over your head and shoulders. so cute in the pic but not realistic. going back.
3 Loved this jumper, i usually wear between a small and a medium in retailer (with jumpers it's mainly because of my hips and where the midline sits on my stomach), so thought this one would probably be a medium. but it was definitely baggy/lose. otherwise i would've totally kept it!
3 This tee was meant to be loose and swishy, but as it runs large, sizing down means the sides come up really high, as they curve a good 3-4" higher up. so your waistband is exposed, and it just doesn't look nice:( returned an xs and small.
3 I ordered this skirt because the 4 i tried on in store was huge and the 2 was way too small. the sizing was an issue so i thought i would try another 4. the skirt that arrived by mail was so wrinkled it was obvious that a day of wear would turn it into a nightmare of unflattering creases and stretched out areas. i like the concept of the design with the button front and a-line "princess" seams in the front and back, but i just feel the fabric in this skirt has too much stretch. i returned it.
3 I really wanted to like this dress and was encouraged by the positive reviews. the dress itself was very comfortable but was very unflattering. the top fabric hit my ribs funny and made me look really wide.
3 This romper was not what i expected when i originally purchased. it is much more casual looking in person, and as soon as i got it out of the bag, one of the buttons fell off. it did look good on and fit well, but i will be returning because it is too casual for the occasion i bought it for.
3 This dress is made of nice thick stretchy fabric. comfortable on, but fairly tight and body hugging. i liked the fabric, but it was the length that got me. i tired on a 6 - i'm 5'6" and this dress was just at that awkward length. made me look short and stunted. not a wow piece.
3 It's ok, fit doesn't wow me because of my body. chest is too wide, hips look too narrow. drapes across my back fat in an especially non-flattering way. basically made my square-apple body look more square-apple. great part about this dress is that it's comfy and hides the tummy pooch. construction is poorly done...contrasting liner at v-neck is rolling out on one side only and then doing the same at the hem contralaterally. another negative point is dry clean only. boo. i'm 5'3" 140# 39-28-35 an
3 This is a well made blouse with a pretty neckline. the print with the sleeves makes me look really wide. it's an odd look.
1 I tried on this jumpsuit in black and it was absolutely beautiful. i liked that it looked sort of like a tuxedo, i wore it one time and received so many compliments. when i washed it, however, it shrunk almost 1 size! the pant legs were high water. i even tried washing and restretching it because i loved the jumpsuit but it wouldn't budge, i think because rayon is not stretchable material. to my disappointment, i returned it. i really wished it would have worked out.
3 I am a true size xl. in my 20s i wore a small and then medium, so i know whereof i am speaking here. i tried this dress on in my local retailer store. this designer, as a handful of retailer designers seem to do, simply enlarges the fabric measurement outward as they add another size. the problem is... a funny thing happens to women's breasts as they gain weight. is this so difficult to understand? as a size small i was an a cup, as a medium i was a b cup. now, years later, as a size 16 i am a d cup
3 They were ok pants but too small. the texture and shape were not what i expected either.
3 Ordered this vest in both the xs and pxs. i liked the length and overall fit of the xs, however, i ended up returning both due to how the vest draped. the outer fabric is a bit more stiff which made the vest balloon out more then what i liked. overall, it?s not a terrible vest but just not for me.
3 I ordered this in tan and white, but ended up returning it. the material is a bit thin (but soft). the shape of the top was decent, i didn't think it was too boxy but i didn't like how the seams looked on the sides. ultimately i didn't think it was worth the price.
1 This skirt is gianormous! i usually take an xl or l, so i ordered both. the waistband on the xl was so huge, i didn't even try it on. i feared it would not stay up! so i tried the large, and it was big as well. i think i would have needed a medium. but as it is, it is not the cute a-line that appears in the picture. (i wonder how they even got it to look like that !?!?!) it is huge, hip-y, and bunchy. yuck.
1 I so wanted this skirt to work, love the design! but, it's way, way too long... i am 5, 5, 116lb, and the small is 1 inch on the floor. i step on the skirt as i walk.
3 This gorgeous &amp;amp;amp; beautiful dress is hampered by a see-through unlined bodice and all viscose/polyester fabrication.  by the way, did you see the price tag?  at least the skirt is lined.  if you have deep pockets and don't mind the slightly rough fabric, go for it.  and wear a nice bra.  size up if you're busty.
3 I bought this for an upcoming conference and was grateful that it shipped very promptly.it runs quite large, in my opinion. i'm 5'7" and about 130-135lbs. the small was huge on me in the chest and shoulders/arms. the stomach also wasn't very fitted. the material is thinner than i expected (you can see through the dress to some extent when you hold it up to the light), but i don't think this is a problem, necessarily. had it been thicker, it probably would be too warm. but you might need a slip
1 The print doesn't necessarily works for everybody.
3 Im 5'1" and about 110lbs. ordered the small because i do have some curves- it was huge- more like a large and didnt have much structure at all. the wool was very soft and stretchy. and like others have said- kinda orange- not true coral color. it fit me like a throw blanket- its going back for sure. might purchase again if the petite xs is back in stock and on sale- this should def be under $100.
3 I ordered these pants in black and brick. the pattern is great, but the sizing and fit are way off. i usually wear an 8 or a medium in retailer. i ordered these pants in a 10, 12, and 12 petite. the 10 actually fit, but there is no stretch in these fitted pants. they were very uncomfortable to walk or sit in. however, if you're standing up all day and not doing much moving around, these pants are perfect! the print is great in both black and brick. i couldn't decide which one i liked best. wish th
3 I want to like and keep. at this price point i cant justify keeping. if it does go to clearance i will reorder. due to the thin material it seems more summery and casual than what i was anticipating. true to size. i ordered a medium and am 5'9 and 155 pounds.
3 Like others, i was drawn to the collar, fabric and overall look to it....________pros:- thicker fabric so it hides lumps and bumps well.- collar is so classy, but i am drawn to anything with a collar.- pockets are a nice touch._______cons:- thicker fabric and polyester = got hot rather quickly in it.- runs a tad small if you have hips. there was only a medium at the store to try on and it fit everywhere but the hips; it just didn't flare out much for me being hourglass. a large
1 This suit was high quality, and a cute design. however, it is clearly made for a lean body type.
3 I ordered the neutral and this dress feels and looks great. but my issue is with the fabric. while very comfortable, it fades where its stretched. so around my bust and my back when i moved my arms. i am 5'9", 145 lbs and the small fit me the best but i tried on the medium just to see if it was a fit issue. the fabric still looked weird. i'm disappointed to send it back but i just can't keep it.
3 Beautiful dress; however, the top was small for my chest and the rest ran large.
1 I loved the dress, but just not dressy enough after rethinking what i needed. very easy order and return. thanks!
3 I ordered this online and was disappointed with the fit when it arrived. i ordered the xs and it was still oversize to the point of being unflattering. i am tall 5'9" about 130 pounds and have a fairly thin torso and look best in cloths that have some shape. if you like a loose fit this might be for you. the material is thicker and warm and comfortable. i would suggest ordering down a size.
3 I really like the style of this top, and it's delicate but well made, but i wish it were longer and less boxy. it's nice that it comes with a separate cami to layer, but the cami is very cropped. when i raise my arms you can see a lot of midriff (and the top is see through so a layer underneath is necessary). a longer cami probably wouldn't work because the top is also very short. i'm 5'0'' with an average torso length, and ordered the xxs petite. also, you would have to cut the tag off if you d
3 This is the perfect peplum. it floats a bit but doesn't stick out and is super flattering. that's why i kept mine even though the front seams were like an inch off, and the peplum pleat is crooked. geeze retailer. this is why i can't justify buying much of anything unless it's on sale. quality in recent years has gone wayyyy downhill.
3 Has anybody washed this shirt a second time? just curious if it continues to shrink.
3 I'm usually a petite, but bought in regular xs. perhaps a petite would have worked better, but this was way too low cut in front and back. i did not like the way it hung on me at all. i'm 5;2" and 105 lbs, but regular xs normally fits better than this did. i could barely keep the shoulders from slipping off. sorry, it's a return for me.
1 This sweater is a lovely color and very soft. however, the sweater 'sheds' terribly and the color is very large distracting from the overall appearance. it's also thin and whatever shirt is worn underneath will show through.
1 I wanted to love these, they are cute and warm - but they have absolutely no elasticity. i'm so mad at myself for not reading the reviews because i ended up wasting money on shipping 2 pairs of leggings that i ultimately took right back to the store.
3 So this is still a pretty cute shirt, but my xs is missing the ruffle in the front and has layers on the bottom front of shirt. it doesn't seem to be defective, just a different version of the shirt. i'm curious to find out from others if they have gotten the same shirt as i have. still deciding whether to keep or not. no more left in xs to place another order and see what's up. i do wish it had the ruffle in front, as that is what caught my eye.
3 I am 6' and typically wear a size 8-10. i am a rather busty kind of gal (36h), so i usually order larges in tops so that i am sure there is no pull across my chest. i ordered a large in this top in the plum color. when i received the top, i could not stop laughing at how huge it was... the fit in the chest area is fine, but i can wrap the sides around me and tie them into a bow. at least half of the material needs to be removed! despite how huge the top is, it is very cute otherwise! i just mail
3 I loved the pattern, color and mock turtleneck style of this top, but it was just too short on me. i purchased the xs in the ivory color (i am 5'5", 32d, 110 lbs for reference). i had planned to layer this under jackets for work, but every time i raised my arms, you could see my stomach. i would not have felt comfortable wearing it to work because of this. the fit was slightly boxy also, and it was not flattering when i tucked it into a skirt because the boxy shape caused the shirt to bunch up s
3 It broke my heart to have to return this dress -- the fabric is simply gorgeous, very high quality, and i love the contrast between the yoke and the rest of the dress. but it was simply not flattering on me. i am 5-4 with a relatively large bust and an overall medium build. the small size fit me perfectly, but the cut just didn't look good on me. i have other tunic dresses that look great on me with tights and boots. so i am not entirely sure why this dress just didn't work for me. it may be tha
3 I absolutely love the fit of these jeans! they are perfect in length and fit nicely on the hips. they are fitted and look nice with boots, but they do not feel tight at all because of the legging material. legging material, while comfortable, typically feels thin, but these do not and they are quite warm.the one major drawback is that the pants have pilled on the thighs. i have had these pants for about 1.5 months now and i have washed them (and have hang dried them) about 4 times. i have neve
3 I love this top. it is very short and hits at a potentially unflattering area if one has wider hips. the fabric and swing to the "skirt" is adorable.
1 Even on my 5'1", short-waisted, 100 lb body, this was super short. it was also super boxy. not flattering at all. the blue was a good color but this is going back.
3 I've been eyeing this top up in the floral pattern for a while and finally ordered it when i had 15% off. i really don't think it's worth the price and it's not very flattering. i think it would look better on someone less busty - it seemed to accent my bust. it's definitely not my favorite piece and unfortunately i will be returning.
3 I have more of an athletic figure, and the sleeves tend to come in closer to the body than pictured. i didn't like that cut on my arms/torso. the shirt is really cute, otherwise! i am usually a size 4/small and this was a little short and snug.
3 The skirt in person is not like the picture. baggy and runs large. i wear jean size 25 and the xs is two size too loose. there's no pocket which is surprising on a denim. the slit in front makes the skirt  look even loose , no shape near what's in the picture. and there's no petite sizes. i am going to return it.
3 The navy blue lines on my dress on the very top of the interior layer can be seen through the upper layer at the very top and it looks cheap. for this price, i would expect more thoughtful patterning. the fit is amazing, so i am debating whether i should keep or return.
3 I tried this dress at the store and it made me look 10 years older. the fit was tts but a bit odd around the waist. i am 5'4" and 160 lbs and tried a small.
3 When i first saw this shirt online i was so excited! it reminded me of why i love shopping in the fall! unfortunately when it came i was so disappointed. in person the fabric and the colors are gorgeous. it's fairly lightweight for a flannel but so soft and comfy cozy. i love the navy/cream polka dot that is on the inside of the cuffs and collar as well, and the buttons are cute too! when i put it on it was so comfortable, but it made me look like i was pregnant! especially from the side it just
3 This top runs large. i am going to return the medium i ordered for a small. i wish it came in different colors. i love the style.
1 I didn't realize that the grey sleeves are attached (i assumed that was just an undershirt on the model). needless to say it looks cheap and poorly made. will be returning
3 Got this in the moss color. i throw on a hoodie almost every day to walk my dog so i justified the high price. returned it because it was not cute on. the waffle fabric didn't stand out, and the bottom just hung straight. i thought it would be more ruffle-like. even on sale i won't buy it ~ it's just that blah
3 Maybe if i sized down to a small i'd like them better.. they look ok from the front. but it seems like the leg was cut way too wide. there is exceess material in the back and leg hole. they are not all flattering to my rear end. overall kind of shapeless and the fabric is prone too wrinkling. too expensive (with the added shipping fee for an online exclusive) for the lack of structure and simplicity.
3 This dress was pretty but had a weird fit. the waist droops down in the middle instead of going straight across, which i found unflattering. i ended up returning it.
1 This looked beautiful online, but the skirt isn't 100% silk - the strips of fabric have different fiber content levels, with most of them containing some level of polyester. parts of the skirt felt like plastic to touch, and one strip has a very prominent gold sheen that looks cheap. overall very disappointing - this is not at all the beautiful silk skirt that it appears to be online.a definite return. i wouldn't even recommend this at first or second cut.
1 I wore this bodysuit once. it had a hole under the arm when i took it off
3 These pants come in great colors and fit nicely if you determine your correct size, which may not be what you usually wear. i have several pair, but i am concerned about investing anymore because of all the complaints on dye stability. retailer is going to have to address this if it is going to continue carrying this product. now, that said, i had a bad accident on one pair of these pants, and the outcome was successful. i wore them to a dinner party and spilled grease on them from one of t
1 I rarely write a really negative review and retailer is my favorite store ever. but this dress is awful. i ordered the black and white. the fabric is very poor quality. the colors are washed out. i almost didn't try it on, but i did and found that, for me, the fit was terrible (though some of the reviewer pictures are cute).
3 I have a curvy figure, and this top is not for me. it fits loose at the top and is tight at the bottom. it is also short. i think this top works best on slender figures.
3 I ordered this on sale, after reading the review, but i was disappointed when i tried it on. the color is darker in person, which is better for me, but it looked dull on my skin tone (pale). also, teh sleeves poofed in a weird way on the top where the seam meets the neck. the overall cut is almost flattering, a little long still for me in petite, i felt like i was trying on a regular size. so not for me. for reference, i ordered the 0p (or xsp, not sure right now). i am 115 lbs, 30dd chest, 26.5
3 I ordered a size 0. the dress was extremely large. i am 5'2 and weigh 110. i guess you really must be 5'9 like the model to wear this dress. such a shame..
3 This top is cut too short & wide with too much light material in between. to be truly slimming & flattering, it needs to have more of the rayon/spandex blend, to make it heavier & bouncier. then it would "hang" appropriately and "swing" and (hopefully) not add pounds to the wearer. unfortunately this top is too lightweight & has too much material. pass.
1 I had to review this because i purchased before any reviews were up and now that i've received this dress i'm appalled by all the positive reviews!!! this dress is hideous in person. seriously hideous. and even if you can get past the drapery fabric, it's incredibly restricting. the picture online is so misleading. the dress isn't even an ivory it's more of a pea green! so disappointed.
3 I usually wear a small, 4 or 6 and in this dress i couldn't even zip up the 8. so tight in the rib cage and chest. if i tried to go up even further the bottom half got much bigger. guess this one is not for me.
1 I really loved the way this shirt looked on me. it's forgiving and flattering, and really lightweight. the fabric, however, couldn't even withstand half a day's wear without snagging 3 times and developing a hole right in the center. i have no idea how this happened, as i wasn't wearing or near anything that could have pulled at it. such a shame. this could have been a staple wardrobe piece for me.
3 The top for this suit is great - i'm pretty small up top so it's rare that i find a suit that doesn't gap. however, the bottoms run so small. for reference, i'm a size 0 in dresses and 2/4 in pants. i ordered the xs and s to start, both were too small. with high hopes that i could keep this adorable suit (and well made otherwise!), i ordered a size m bottom. they were still small. sadly, i'm giving up and returning. only order this suit if you're super, super tiny on the bottom.
3 This shirt is beautiful and so soft. it would have made a wonderful long-sleeved tee except for the fact that it was so low cut. the only way this is wearable is with a tank underneath which, for me, defeats the purpose of this type of shirt. i am rather busty (34 dd), so maybe if you are smaller on top you might could pull it off.
3 I tried this jacket on and it was definitely cute but a couple things to note. it's a wool acrylic blend and it was already starting to pill from being tried on in the store. also, it's unlined. i thought the price point was high given its fibers and unlined. given its hem, i wonder how much longevity the piece has and how quickly it might start to look dated too.
3 As you can see, there is an array of differing opinions on here, and i share sentiments on both:_______pros:- the texture and feel of this is great; it is very comfortable and is different.- tts for the most part; i normally can wear sizes 10 and 12 (m and l) with most retailer and got the medium and the fit was overall fine but more snug at the hips. if you're more slim/straight, it'll probably fit you like on the model. - good length, not too short or too long.- the mock collar is ni
3 The fabric is super soft and comfortable and the look is cute, however the drape on the front crossover is not great and doesn't flatter well. the shorts will probably run a little on the short side for some - i'm very short (5') and the length is great for me but i'm guessing not for the average height.
3 I ordered a medium and it fit perfectly. i am anywhere from a size 6-8. 5'9, 155lbs.sadly, i am returning this dress because the horizontal stripes make my hips look huge.
3 I ordered this in the blue, it's a beautiful shade of blue. love the lace up detail in the back, but the size small was just short and very wide. i understand it is a swing top, but this was not flattering on me. i'm short waisted, 34-d, 5'3, 125 lbs.  i'm sure it would be cute on a very thin person.
3 Sooo this adorable blouse is indeed different than pictured. no ruffle, such a bummer, sleeves are much longer, and yes it's teared in the front and back. also the button opening on the back is much longer/larger, in my opinion. i'll most likely keep it, but consider the mentioned if buying.
3 This is a beautiful shirt, however the cut and drape were off. i'm only 104 pounds, but this top made me look pregnant. the fabric jutted out at the front. it's a shame, because it really is lovely. i sent it back.
1 Bought the gold pair and dripped something on them so spot cleaned them with water only. my white washcloth turned bright yellow. the food came out but surrounding area was super faded. so i returned them, took the second pair home, wore them a few times, they stretched out so much, washed them in cold water and they have splotches that are really light. these pants are way too much trouble.
1 It's a cute top but once i washed in cold water and laid flat to dry it shrunk and lost it's shape. very disappointed. i am going to return top.
1 Looks fitted on, but this just turned out to be an oversized muumuu on. the fabric also felt cheap.
3 Nice material, hits high waisted, mine was a return that was not repacked and was just balled in the bag and was so wrinkled that even if it looked good, you couldn't tell. very disappointed to have it arrive in that condition-so not typical of retailer.
3 I really like how this looks on the model, but in real life this top is much tighter. i was hoping for a good layering top and have been playing around with the trend of lace up tops. i bought it without trying on figuring a small would work, but it was much too tight and the lace top reminded me of vans shoes. i returned it, a girl much tinier than myself has it and it is very cute on her. so, best works on a model body type figure than someone with even slight hips.
3 Love pilcro jeans and really hoped these would work for me. lovely soft material (98% cotton/2%, which you don't see often anymore!), great length, nice medium rise but for me the deal breaker was the lack of belt loops. the braided detail at the waist is a fun design touch, but as someone with a small waist and wider hips, i almost always have to wear a belt with jeans and that's just not possible with these. if you don't usually wear a belt or have a straighter figure, these might work better
3 I am very into the lace tops! purchased this but it's a very exaggerated swing top and on someone who is 5'3, it feels almost like a tunic. lots of extra material in the back. love the look and if you're tall enough, it should work for you!
3 My girlfriend and i both purchased these leggings in grey. we love the color because it goes with so many things.the problem is they do not fit the same. hers ran true to size and mine ran small. i am tempted to reorder another pair to see if they fit differently.
3 Let me start by saying that i cannot wear wool. it doesn't matter what type it is or if it is combined with cashmere, it makes me itch so much that i just can't do it and i didn't not find this as itchy as others stated. that being said, you definitely need to size down. i am a standard small and purchased the xs and there is still a load of fabric. i still don't know what to think. i think it is okay but i am not sure it justifies the price point.
1 I loved the color and design until i tried it on in the store. i am 5'5" with a slender build. i tried my usual xs but couldn't manage to put this shirt on me without risking smear my makeup or scratch my face by the elastic band at the neckline. the band is so small even fully stretched out. i have a normal sized head just in case you wonder... i gave up after wrestling with it. i can only imagine how uncomfortable to wear something with a tight elastic band choking me...funny... but not funny.
3 This is a cute shirt, but it has slits at the bottom of the hem so that the front bottom of the shirt has this small rectangular "flap." it's not visible from the photo. i think it'll have to be returned for this reason.
3 This is an average top. i thought it would be a good work shirt (my office is very causal), but it was just too loungey looking. fit is true to size. the fabric is thin- a little see through. not worth $108 in my opinion. i returned it.
3 I was excited to order this sweater. when it arrived, the green didn't stand out as much as the picture here. it also felt too itchy. i usually wear either very soft wool or wool with cashmere because i can't stand plain thick heavy wool. this one was just too itchy for me, it is going back.
3 Bought this shirt because i loved the cut and the stripes. had little to no shape to it. some may think it runs big but it appears that is the look this top is going for. i feel like being short, i just looked kind of dumpy on me. fabric is nice but borders on see through. it was just ok....nothing exciting.
3 I love the fabric however the overall fit did not work for me. i think the arms are much smaller than the overall shirt.
3 Overall, it's a beautiful dress, and i really wanted it to work. but the material feels cheap (at least not what you'd expect for the price), and as other reviewers have mentioned, it's just a tad too short. for reference, i'm 5'5, 125 lbs and the 2 fit well, but hung well above my knees. there's no way i could wear this without unintentionally flashing a few people. sadly this dress will be returned.
3 I ordered the blue stripe and white in size large. i didn't like it worn off shoulder but it does stay in place, which is a good thing. and it looks okay worn on the shoulders. i find the fabric so uncomfortable and itchy that i couldn't wait to take it off, immediately. i tried them on again a second time, still hopeful, with the same outcome. sadly, returning.
3 I really liked the color and style of this dress, but the proportions were off. the top was too small and the waist was too large. if you are more uniform in size/shape and less of an hourglass this dress may be perfect for you!
3 I saw this top in the box and was excited to try it on. the print is absolutely stunning and gorgeous, i could not wait. when i tried it on, it is such a loose top and a tad short. it was flowy all over. i expected it to be loose from the picture but not like this. it would work best on a very slender figure with white pants or leggings. i don't recommend it for a curvy figure, just not flattering. makes everything look big. what a waste because the print is so nice.
3 I really like this skirt but unfortunately there is no lining, so it's a bit see through under the light. also there is no hook at the top of the zipper to secure the skirt. i just think that with this kind of price, the skirt should come at least with the lining. otherwise, it's beautiful skirt, flowy and very feminine.
1 This dress fits awfully. it's not short, as pictured in photo. it hit just above my knees. it looked like sack. i would've, also, felt like i was choking  all night with it clasped around my neck. it, potentially, may look okay on someone who is very tall, skinny, and lanky, but i have my doubts about that too.
3 Love the style, weight (not too hot) and look but it sheds all over any pants other than jeans. i also wore a white tank under it and it stained it blue. very disappointed
3 I thought this was a sweet design but it is too boxy for me.
3 I was hoping to wear this dress on my wedding day before the ceremony. i'm 5'5", 130 pounds, usually wear a 6. i ordered this dress in medium and it hangs off of me. it is not straight as it looks on the model, but bells out from the waist. the sleeves are so long that they covered my fingers.
1 Cut out design, no seems or hems. very disappointed in retailer
3 I wanted to love these, but they're so tight around the top. my legs are normal size and i couldn't get them above my knee. the top isn't stretchy...it has a string that keeps it from expanding. they are so very cute, but unfortunately must go back for me.
3 Is a great top for layering over leggings, running errands or after the gym. the material was thin. i returned it because the color didn't look great on me and for the price, i just didn't love it.
1 After reading the previous reviews i thought sizing down would be a great idea. as soon as i pulled it out of the bag i knew that the xs/s was still wayyy too big. for reference i am 5'3 and a 34ddd and usually wear an 8 but this thing was enormous. it was shapeless and boxy but done so horribly it looked like i was pregnant. it has an adjustable draw string at the bottom which helps to make you look like a balloon. such a disappointment. the design was lovely and it looked very high quality and
1 I ordered a size 16 in the orange. it ran a size smaller than normal size 16 maeve tops. the quality of the material was terrible. it wrinkled and was also so thin that you need to wear a tank underneath. that messes with the look of the lace on the top. the color of the orange was gorgeous.
3 I'm pretty tan and i always have to be careful with white tops or pants. i love the embroidery detail but this top is practically see-through for me. it is double-lined, but i could still see my bra. very pretty though and i was disappointed that it didn't work for me.
3 The top is a pretty and has a nice pattern. it does run large and is it a bit billowy. i am 5'4 petite and ordered a small ( maybe the xs would have been better). however, the top swallowed me up and was unflattering. the colors are true to the picture..not very bright, but would be a nice transition to fall top.the feel of the blouse was nice and maybe if i was taller and ordered a smaller size it would have been better.
1 I bought this very cute t-shirt in sky. wore it once, then washed it according to the washing instuctions (machine washable/dryable). this t-shirt turned into a crop top!!!!! i can't wear it. it's going to goodwill. i would suggest that you air dry this shirt, if you want to take the chance that it won't shrink up several inches.
3 I was so excited to finally find a work appropriate contemporary pant that i wore them about 3 times in the first week. needless to say they needed to be washed, and i followed the care instructions by washing in cold water and laying flat to dry. after just a single wash in cold water, the pants faded to the point that they looked like they were three years old. so sad, luckily retailer took them back without a problem. be warned, these may need to be dry cleaned which is a lot of maintena
3 This jacket was too wide and the length in the arms too short. i wear a medium in almost any article of clothing and felt like i was swimming in a short little jacket. the ratio of how wide it is to the length is not for me but might work well with other body types. the arms were definitely too short.
1 The yellow is not as bright as the pic and the tee shirt base color is more off white/oatmeal making the shirt look much more drab in person than in the pics. fit was ok but nothing special about this and will be returning.
3 I ordered it in two colors because of excellent reviews. nice material, but fit is not for me. i will be returning them.
3 After reading all the reviews, i ordered up a size. the problem isn't that it runs small. it's that they took the bodice of a true size and stuck it on the skirt of a small size. or if you want to think of it differently - the bodice of a large size on to the skirt of a true size. the 4 top with the 6 bottom would be perfect. unfortunately - you get a size 4 fitted bodice with a skirt that puckers at the back and shows all your flaws (spare tire) or a size 6 that is atrociously long in the torso
1 There was nothing i liked about this coat. it was definitely not designed with a chest in mind. the pins on the straps were already coming off the first time i tried it on. i usually like oranges too, but even this color turned me off.
3 It feels soft and like a good quality. however it really does run large and long. i was looking for a loose tank but this one was almost a tunic on my short height and even with a cardigan to give it a shape didn't work out. i also thought it would shrink in the dryer but it didn't. also wrinkles easily.
3 Overall the top is cute . what doesn't show in the photo are the pleats on the shoulder/neck area. the placement of the pleats makes you look like you have a football player neck . the neck area doesn't lay flat but comes off as puffy at your neck. i've never seen pleats placed in such a spot. ruined an otherwise cute top
3 Bells out to much i had to send it back
3 I was searching for the perfect large comfy sweater for the cold winter weather ahead and i thought this would be it. it looks so cute in the pictures but when i received in by mail it wasn't what i was searching for. this sweater, like on the model, is quite large. although i wanted a large sweater, the fit of this one didn't fit well on me. it has more of a boxy feel to it. i usually wear a medium, but went with a small because i expected this to fit a little large and it still engulfed me. i
3 I was so excited for this romper, but was disappointed after trying it on. the material felt cheap for the price, and it runs quite small. will be returning. :(
3 Love the color, but the fit is just odd and frumpy. the sleeves are shorter than the should be. when i lift my arms, the entire sweater gets lifted. going back.
1 I'm usually a maeve fan. i found this top to look cheap and fit poorly. it is also very thin material and showed everything.
3 I bought this sweater online and was surprised by how thick and fluffy it is. this is a warm and cozy sweater, more bulky than oversized. pattern has a comic book-style art look. it has raglan sleeves and a boxy cut and narrows a bit at the waist. cute, warm sweater for winter--wore with an undershirt.
3 Not up to retailer standards! fabric quite thin(you could see nude-color bra through the white one) and thin fabric, wide bottom hung sloppy; no way i would feel "well dressed" in this top. i returned it.
3 I really want to like this dress - it's beautiful, but it just fits like a sack. the yoke exaggerates my bust and the dress makes me look 20 lbs heavier. perhaps if you are tall and thin like the mode, or small chested, it would be great! the quality and color is beautiful.
3 I nearly always wear a size small, and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this, and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.
3 ...the print is so sharking, and i love the way it looks on the model -- but i'm a more curvy figure, and the boxy-ish cut plus rather stuff fabric in front is incredibly unflattering. ordinarily i love everything made by maeve, but this one sadly must be returned... on a thinner/straighter-shaped person i expect it would be great.
3 I was excited to nab this lovely because i am a sucker for a faux layered look. i am usually an xs or s, depending on the designer so i went with xs in this top based on reviews that it doesn't drape well. i barely got my arms into the sleeves. i thought maybe it was a mistake and i received a child's size?  i eventually did get it on but barely got it back off. size up 1-2 for comfort if you have to have this girl. i was bummed my local retailer did not have a m for me to try. returned.  for ref:
3 I wanted to love this skirt. i love high-waisted skirts and the length seemed flattering on the model; it was not so flattering on me. the fabric is so lovely--truly the photos online don't do it justice. it's heavy and luxurious, wonderful for fall or winter, and the gold, gray, and navy floral pattern is not too flashy or bold. plus, pockets! however, the midi length did not work for me, despite the product's suggestion that it was a universally flattering length, just above the knee. i'm not
1 I waited three months for these pants. when they finally arrived, i was mostly pleased. they seemed like the staple pant everyone is raving about. and they should have been.problem one: they bag out. i got one wear out of them before i needed to wash and hang to dry (regained shape then).problem two: the crotch split! in the front! i'm a teacher. i sincerely hope no one noticed! i read other reviews about this problem and don't know if i got a bad batch or if a similar fate is awaiting other
3 Unfortunately i didnt read the fine print when i ordered this re: dry cleaning only, but this in itself wasnt a total deal breaker. it did fit well -- i am 5'2, 32c, 107 lb and the xs petite fit very well, definitely form-fitting, not long in the arms or waist. the grey heather design was not my favorite look, actually thats the main reason i am returning it -- there was a dark grey splotch of the heathered design on the chest, and it looked like i had a huge dark stain.
3 The top falls nicely, great quality, the lace is beautiful. however, the sleeves are too wide and puffy. the top is voluminous and i wished it had more form fitting sleeves to balance this out. the top does not look flattering on me so i will be returning it.
3 Ahhh, i should have listened to previous reviews. indeed, this top runs very large. style wise, it is ok. i would say you could do much better at retailer.
1 The fabric is very nice on this wrap, but it wears like a blanket.
1 I was so excited to receive this dress only to come find out that it was not tweed, not the same colors as the picture, spandex material, the fit runs smaller than most of their dresses and the sleeves are capped. i love retailer and prefer their clothes above all other brands but i was extremely disappointed in this dress.
3 Like the color and romper style. this runs extremely large. i am normally a petite small and it was too large. with the wide- leg style and overall length you may need to alter this piece.
3 I was disappointed with this jumpsuit. when i first saw it in the store, i thought i was going to love it. when i tried it on, the first issue is the fabric is too sheer. i could completely see the outline of my underwear and bra. it also runs way too big! i know the bottom is supposed to be loose and flowy, but the waist needs to be more tapered to off set that, and it's so baggy. the arm holes are also cut very low, so when you lift your arms you can see most of your bra on the sides i wante
1 I wanted to love this sweater but it is a return. it is a very weird fit, very thick, rug-like material and unfitted. the shoulders are bulky, the top is big and the booty is small. i am 5'2", 34c and typically wear a small. the arms were very long, way too long. i will say other than that the top was true to size, may look okay on someone who had a larger chest and a smaller bum!
3 I wish these zipped up instead of the drawstring. they are super cute but don't care for the way they sit on the hips.
3 For the price of this tee the beautiful front lattice work should have been extended onto the back. would have been a classier, more finished looking garment. if the cost is not an issue then this tee makes a nice neutral addition to a neat but casual summer look.
3 This is a cute dress but the fabric is very heavy and i didn't find it to drape well on me. it is a very heavy felted poly type of fabric. i ordered it for a specific event coming up this summer and the fabric will not work for warm temps. the style and design of the dress is great though. for reference it did fit fairly true to size. i wear a 0 or 2. the xs fit well. if the fabric works for your situation then i would try this dress.
3 I like the idea of the pullover. the quality of is nice; the material is very soft and feels pleasant to the touch.i expected this sweater to be more flattering though. it is true to size, but the length is strange. it seems a bit too long, yet is too short to look like a longer tunic. or maybe the waistline is a little low... whatever it is, it makes me look like i have short legs.also, the collar won't stay down, the way it is shown in the picture. but it may work better for someone wi
3 I really liked the fabric and the design of this sweater, but the sleeves hung at an odd length (no way to push them up like on the model) and the sweater was large on me. i have broad shoulders but am otherwise petite. unfortunately i had to return this. glad others are having better luck.
3 I do think this blazer is comfortable and looks decently cute, but wasn't sure about the fabric. hte coloring is fun too. i decided to pass on it only because of the previous review regarding shedding.
3 This is a very pretty shirt which is too narrow across the back. i need to be able to move my arms freely at work, so this did not work for me. you may be able to size up for a better fit if moving your arms is important to you.
3 I bought this dress for a wedding i have this summer, and it's so cute. unfortunately the fit isn't perfect. the medium fits my waist perfectly, but was way too long and too big in the bust and shoulders. if i wanted to spend the money, i could get it tailored, but i just felt like it might not be worth it. side note - this dress was delivered to me with a nordstrom tag on it and i found it much cheaper there after looking!
3 This is a nice dress, but i'm glad i tried it on in the store. not for women with bigger breasts. i'm 36d and size 10 didn't fit me on top. lace part was too short to cover the whole area. other than that color is great .
1 The dress is pretty, i ordered a 4 and 6 not knowing how it ran, i took both back the neck is too tight!
3 Very nice material, soft and feminine colors. however, the waist sat higher than my natural waist and was uncomfortable. unfortunately it's going back
3 Usually i am a huge meadow rue fan, but not this time. the print is okay, but the shirt seemed stiff and the material was not soft. if the print was just okay but the shirt was super soft or vice versa i would have probably kept the shirt, but since it was neither it was returned?
3 I purchased the moss color in this cardigan. i really love the texture of the material. it is very very soft. my issue with this is the arms. like other reviewers have said they are extremely small! i went up to a large rather than my usual medium and they were still tight. i really wanted this to work but i will probably return due to the arms.
1 I agree with the other reviewer about the great colors, but when i took this off the rack to try one, you can see through both layers of fabric. i thought, insulting quality, for the price. i imagine the holes would start after one wearing.
3 I love this dress and had so hoped to wear it to a wedding in june. the fabric is a perfect weight, very nice cotton, i only wish i could have kept it. i am 5'3", 133 lbs and usually wear a size 6 which is what i ordered. it was fine in the skirt but the top was at least a size if not two sizes too small for 32 chest. i did not want to wear it open with a tee and so had to send it back. the wedding date does not allow for the new available date for the dress.
3 I wish i could wax poetic about this gorgeous cardigan. i would have happily bought it in both colors except for the deal-breaking design flaw - the extremely tight sleeves. even if you have stick-thin arms, i don't know how you would ever be able to wear anything other than a tank top under it. sadly for me, this was a no go :(
3 This is just okay for me. the top is soft and surprisingly flattering, especially from the side, but the front rides up and the neckline never lays flat. it washes well and the tan/white combo is cute, but a little transparent.
1 This may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried. the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo, absolutely garish. the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties, it just looks cheap. the skirt is an antebellum nightmare.  i did not even want to try it on, it's that bad. i considered adding a photo, but was too horrified.for reference, i'm 5'10", approximately the height/ size of the model, but it was shorter than the photo depictes. i wanted to like it,
3 This would be great on someone with a slim build. it's very true to size, it hits above the hips and runs pretty straight through the body for a boxy look. i loved the color and pointelle detail but on my thicker build it just sort of hung in a too-casual way. note that it is the kind of cotton that is likely to stretch with wear (and spring back with cleaning).
3 This blouse is gorgeous, but as other reviewers have noted it runs small and it's very thin. the back is see-through, not the front, though if you tend to wear things a little large and order up a size, the back is fine. my real issue is that it shrank so much when i washed it (on cold, delicate cycle, hang dry) that it's pretty much unwearable now. sad.
3 Wanted to love these pants, they are way, way, too long (i'm 5'4 128lbs for reference). i didn't love the way they looked cuff and didn't think it was worth having them hemmed. loved the color. would work well for someone tall and slim.
1 Uhm no. oh dear, no. i was initially drawn to this blouse's lovely fabric, the color and pattern are truly stunning. i decided to give it a try because it seemed somewhat boxy, oh boy was i right. sadly, this is one of the least flattering tops that i've ever tried on at retailer. it might be a great maternity top, though.
3 The dress has a flattering cut and is a nice color. but, the fabric looks like old, matted carpet. i will be returning.
3 The description doesn't indicate the metallic thread throughout the design. you cannot tell from the pix either. it's also a really strange design with the arm holes being almost the entire length of the sweater. can't decide if i want to keep it or return it.
3 I tried this dress on in the store. it fit okay, but the orange is so bright, i couldn't bring myself to buy it.
3 I lived the front and back designs but didn't like the fit.
3 Was really excited to get this, but got it on and i was swimming in it. i'm not a tiny girl thicker athletic build and the large was massive. sadly had to return. don't know if i'll try a size down.
3 I wanted this dress in wine for a holiday party. but it just has no life whatsoever. unlike prior reviewer, i found nothing to dislike about the fabric. the fabric is fine and the fit is fine. i'm sometimes an 8 and sometimes a 6; took this in an 8 and definitely would not size down. it's relatively close- and well-fitting, but the sleeves and neckline further ruined it for me. the sleeves are shapeless, long and baggy. the neckline is just blah. it needs to be neater, trimmer, more cut. the ruc
3 The top looks like an oversized shirt in the model photo but as you can see it's not at all in person. made with what feels like hospital scrubs-meets-crisp-poplin, this shirt is stiff and does not lay flat against the body. the cut is almost triangular or bell shaped causing it to jut out - think of a flared wide leg pant - but as a shirt. the sleeves have a similar cut as well. i, too, am a 34c and found it made me look much wider as your bust will cause the shirt to move away from you. it's s
1 This looks nothing like it does on the website. it runs small and the colors are so muddy. it doesn't drape nicely and i a musually an xs and this was short, stiff and plain ugly. sent it back immediately.
1 I tried this dress on in the store. i loved the fabric and color, but the fit was huge, no matter how much i sized down. there are full dresses and tunics that are supposed to be loose, but this was shapeless in an unflattering way. i was attracted to the style and color, but the execution left much to be desired.
1 1. this looks so cute on the model, doesn't it? i have no idea where you wear a suit with hot pants, but it looks cute.2. that said, keep in mind the model is probably 6 feet 10 inches tall. i'm 5 feet 6 inches tall, and this jacket came down to my knees. i'm not kidding. the 3/4 length sleeves were at my wrist, so more like 7/8 sleeves.3. i'm normally a size 12 in cartonnier jackets, but this only comes s, m or l. the medium is really a size 10, which was too tight across the shoulders and
3 I recommend with reservations. these leggings are 100% wool, soft, not itchy, light weight, lovely knitted pattern. they run large. i sized down to a small. the first time i wore them they were fine. but the second time the waist stretched out and was useless: they were falling down as i walked. such a shame because everything else about them is perfect for cold winter days. they even fit under my silk skirt and would make other lighter garments wearable in winter. so what to do? at the price th
1 This dress is huge. i am normally a l-xl regular in retailer brands. i love a loose, flowy dress. after trying one on in the store (just a random returned petite xl) i ordered the petite medium. and it was still huge and not flattering. so sad. i wanted to love this- loved the material and colors, but way off.
3 I usually wear an 8, which wasn't available, and sized up to the 10 which fit just fine as there is no stretch and it's a set-in waist band. the fabric is pretty, the skirt is fully lined, the length is not too short, and the only thing i don't like is the big bronzey toothed zipper - it looks ok on the beige version, but on the black it stands out.it's perfect for summer but i could also see wearing the black version during holidays.
1 The fabric was nothing special (i usually like a cotton/silk blend woven fabric, but this was stiff feeling) and the pattern was cute. but what made me return it was the fact that 1) the rose gold glitter dots are puffy paint. literally. puffy. paint. and 2) the dots were not quite dry on my top when it arrived. parts of the paint came off on my fingers and the top was stuck to itself because of it. i could barely unfold it.i'm sure this could have been cute, but who wants a top that looks lik
3 Comfortable and soft material, cute design and nice longer length..however, i'm long waisted and this looked ridiculous on my me, elastic came up right under my bra and not at my waist. would be cute for someone shorter.
3 These are cute and light weight however the fit is off. i ordered my normal size large (i'm a 12/14.). the waist was large but fit ok. they were really tight across the theighs. the crop length is fine with my 5'9 height. if i hadn't got such a good sale of probably return them. they will be good lounge pants.
3 Cute top, not great on me. beautiful, bright color.
1 Was so excited to get this dress because i thought it was cute and i love flowy and big dresses - however this looks huge. the material is not soft so it doesn't fall well. it just stays proofed out so from the back you look like a giant!!
3 This skirt is not what i was expecting at all. for starters it runs large, i expected it to sit at the natural waist and it is definitely made to do so, but it was a good two inches too big and therefore wouldn't lay flat and gaped at the front. no bueno. my biggest gripe, though, is that the color looks nothing like it does in the picture. they have it paired with an ivory top and the two look like they match so well but do not be fooled, the background color of this skirt is not even close to
3 I tried on the xs petite, and liked it but didn't love. the arm holes seemed big, you could see my pink bra peeked through on te sides. also, the material is soft but thin (see through, somewhat). the xs petite, just seemed big overall, i would try the xxs petite if it goes on sale and is available. i am 115 lbs, 30dd for reference.
1 I was very disappointed in the quality of this top. the first time i wore it it snagged right in the front. i had to pull the thread under so it wasn't exposed. i put it in the wash in the gentle cycle and it was destroyed with several more snags when i removed it from the machine. this top is extremely delicate and doesn't withstand normal everyday casual wear although it's s casual lightweight sweater. now it's just a wear around the house ratty throw around shirt.
3 First, i love moth clothing and own many, many of their pieces. this is very cute and i purchased it to go with the jules tank. the other reviewers are spot on with the cute factor and that it runs a little larger than the cropped sweaters. the snails are very cute, buttons run all the way down...caveat: it began to pill after only a having it on a few hours - and i wasn't doing anything to cause extra friction- just sitting and lounging mostly. i noticed pilling on the inside of the arms when
3 I personally love this romper. there's a lot of fabric to it, so it feels lush and substantial. and the pockets! they're so roomy i actually couldn't find my phone for a hot second. the crotch of the legs (because, yes, this thing is actually pants) is very long and so i was very comfortable sitting.the two things i don't love about this piece include the downfall of all rompers imo: not bathroom-break friendly. you basically have to disrobe. and since the legs are so long, you end up clingi
1 I was hoping these would be like some of the lace shorts i bought from retailer last year that i loved so much. sadly, no. first of all they run small. i am between a s and xs in most brands, bought a s in these because i like my shorts on the looser side. these felt a little snug and short, but i decided to keep them. the first time i washed them, they were ruined. i followed the directions exactly and even put them in a lingerie bag in the washer, plus a delicate cycle, no dryer. the lace is man
3 When i read all these positive reviews i did not hesitated, as i wanted good basics which will be good investment in me as looking good is always investment. well, i love blue color as i am blonde wih blue eyes and this color makes my eyes brighter and matches almost everything but..the design of the shirt is made oversize fit basically the shirt should not be dressed as fitted it's more relaxed fit so if you wear medium go head and order medium even if the small fits unless you want to look lik
3 Following the advice of other reviews, i ordered a size larger than normal, since the reviews said runs small in the bust. the dress ended up being much too big everywhere, including the bust.the dress was beautiful and great quality! sad i ended up with the wrong size.
3 I returned this as it was way too boxy/loose. ordered a size small but probably needed to size down.
3 Gorgeous dress, but so low in front and in back...i couldn't figure out how to pull it off without a cardigan/sweater. beautiful fabric and color.
3 After reading other reviews i ordered a small. my usual size is a m. it was huge all around. it's a beautiful print but i think it would make a nice maternity top.
1 I ordered this in a size 1 which i thought would be a small and it was very, very wide. it is very short too. i typically wear a small and am 5'8" and 132 lbs. it's going back unfortunately. very soft material though.
3 The fabric is very thin. i have seen this comment on several sundry reviews, but its hard to imagine how thin the fabric is until you see it in person. i could put a cami under it - but it was also rather short on me. i don't usually have trouble with shirts running short and can even sometimes wear petite sizes since i am only 5'4".
3 I'm keeping this top bc it was on sale but it does look a little maternity! i wore with super skinny white jeans and 3" casual heel. i'm short so i needed a little more height to slim me but if your tall and and slender this might work better for you?
3 This sweater is beautiful, especially in the bordeaux color. the cable knit in varying directions makes it interesting and unique and the length is great for us short waisted ladies. my big issue with this sweater is the sleeves. there really are no sleeves, just arm holes at the same level as the hem of the sweater, so you feel as if you need to keep your arms pinned to your sides to keep from lifting the sweater up to expose your midsection, or pushing the sleeves way up, which then results in
3 What a let down. this is not what i would call a coat but a sweater. it is unlined and very lightweight. the fit was cute and would have been so great if it was actually a coat.
3 I ordered the dress online and found it to be not as pictured.  the length hit several inches above the knee.  the sleeves are also 3/4 length rather than full length as pictured.  i found the cut to be much less fitted through the torso as well.  i tried both the small and xsmall, which are my usual sizes.  the small was very loose through the torso, the xsmall was better, but looked overall too short, as if it were a petite cut.  i am 5'9", however the model is supposed to be 5'10".
3 I ordered this in a small petite. with tracy reese i never really know what to expect in terms of sizing. i'm 5 ft tall about 118 pounds. i'm in between a 4 petite and a 6 petite depending on the brand, broad shouldered, slim hipped and very short waisted. i found this dress to fit a little large. it was quite shapeless on me though i did like the wide scoop neck.i'm sending this back sadly. quality is nice, though a bit thin for winter time.
3 This tunic is simple and well made. it was not as long as on the model as on me but i am 5'-9".
3 I ordered this in size xl and it ran small. i'm a pear-shape and thought this style would be flattering. i have a few other peplum-style sweatshirts from retailer that are my favorites. but, the cut on this is tighter so the bottom layers gap and don't flow well. i found it to run short too. it's cut one size too small. i would have sized up but, being xl, there's no option for that. i'm returning mine.the applique is done well and is cute. the colors look the same in person.
3 It is a very pretty bra. light weight and beautiful lace. however, i have yet to find a t-back that does not make me feel like i am going to spill out. to me it ran small. i now know to get a 34 instead. i am working on losing weight, perhaps that might help with the fit?
3 I ordered this on-line. while it fits well before washing, the fabric is a bit thin. i'm afraid it might shrink in the wash, too. i haven't worn it yet because i'm trying to decide it i will keep it or return it. colors are a bit more muted than i would like also.
1 I usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops, ordered this top in an s and it was so wide on the sides and huge it fit like a tent.  not even remotely flattering.  i thought about ordering it in an xs, however, i could tell the xs was still going to have way too much fabric.  back it goes.
3 Definitely was disappointed in the fit of this potentially very cute shirt. just too large; too much fabric for me. i'm usually an xs and there was just no shape to that size for my small bod. i wouldn't have minded the longer length if there had been a better fit up top. i think the colors are also a bit duller in person. love the concept though!
3 Love the cut and the way they drape. size 26 and 5'6" 135lbs fit great until you wear them for an hour. all of a sudden my 26s became 28s. they were practically falling off. i plan to wash them to see if they shrink. i wish they held their shape since they are so cute.
3 This top is gorgeous in both detail in color. it fit great and true to size, but then i hand washed it as instructed on the label and it shrank substantially to the point that it's now too short and needs to be returned.
3 Cute. i love the button back detail. but it's completely see-through. i could have worked with that by putting a cami underneath, but the arm holes were too tight. didn't look bad, just felt uncomfortable. you can't really tell in the pic, but there's elastic on the arm holes. it'll work if you have super skinny arms, but apparently i don't.
3 I bought this shirt in white and am happy with the fact that it's not too sheer. the back detail is great. my only complaint is that it is too long. i got the small and it fits nicely in the arms and top, but it is much longer on me than on the model. i'm 5'5" tall. it doesn't look great when i do a half tuck, but it looks fine if i tuck it all the way in. maybe an xs would have been a better fit.
3 I really wanted to love this. sadly, the first thing i noticed was how tight it was in the arms and across the back (size up maybe even two sizes). secondly, it's see through! a top like this looses it's finesse to me once i can see my pant line and bra. it's very difficult to do the three buttons in the back yourself and finally, good luck taking it off without getting make up all over the neckline. someone dubbed it the "poor man's pineapple top." i couldn't agree more, sigh. i really did want
3 I wanted to love this dress as it would have been perfect for a wedding i have in october however, the fit was awful;. the dress was heavy with a funky liner. it also had these little black straps around the top of the arm/neck that looked out of place. it ran true to size but i have a large chest (32dd) and it was pretty fitted around the area but loose everywhere else. sadly, dress had to be returned.
3 Dress caught my eye on the rack so i thought i'd try it on. the dress has lovely blue stripes (hard to discern in the online photo) which makes it a great year-round piece. however, like others have commented, it is too low to wear to work. will consider alternations to close the v-neck if the dress is marked down beyond its current sale price.
3 This dress has gorgeous fabric and impeccable quality construction! i'm 5'4 118lbs and large busted (32. dd). i am usually an overall size 4 but when buying dresses usually have to purchase a six to accommodate my chest. i ordered a size 4 because that was the only size left and was going to take a chance . it fit perfect across the chest but the overall dress is enormous! does not even slightly silhouette your figure. it is like a giant stiff triangle. i was going to return but was so hesitant
3 As a petite, big busted woman, i found this dress wildly unflattering. the quality and pattern of the dress itself is beautiful, though it will require a slip as it is completely transparent. the design of the bust however, i found unflattering.
3 How can some reviewers say this jacket is true to size, yet others say it runs small? i think it's because this jacket is cropped. by the time i took advantage of the fall perks 20 percent discount, the xs peach was sold out so i ended up ordering size s. i also got the xs gray to compare. sure enough, the xs looks better but is cropped on me. for ref, i'm 5' 5", 32a, 115 lbs. i don't really need another almost black jacket so i'm either sized out or have to exchange for xs peach to wear with dr
3 I bought this in size xl and the overall fit matched the model's photos. the neckline was a bit higher than pictured. the material was pretty in person. the problem was the material's threads were too scratchy. i was uncomfortable with that scratchiness against my neck so i returned it. i did like the unique leaf pattern of the lace.
3 I'm pretty disappointed in these. just bought the yellow pair and wore today for the first time. super cute and very comfortable. i was in love with them. they got two small stains on them from the day's activities ( and not even crazy, untreatable stains). unfortunately, the stains did not budge yet the color of the shorts washed out. they are completely ruined after one washing (on cold). i'm hoping this was a fluke and plan to order a second pair before they sell out. these will be going back
1 This dress is so cute! i went to the store to try it on and although i knew the dress would fit i could not get the zipper up. my mom, the sales lady and i all tried to get the zipper up and it would not move past the ribbon. i wish i could have bought this dress but i can't without a working zipper. i tried a size up and every dress at the store that was my size and none of them worked. please fix the zipper problem so i can have this dress!
1 I wanted this jacket to fit on me like in the photo, but i guess my frame was still to petite. the fabric was also on the cheap end
1 Was really excited for this dress and couldn't be more disappointed. doesn't look anything like the pictures.the fabric feels...cheap. it came wadded up in a ball and is a wrinkled mess. looking beyond that, i tried it on and thought i had put it on incorrectly. unfortunately not. the top half doesn't sit correctly. it's so bizarre that it seems like a flaw in the design. it doesn't sit on your shoulders, but doesn't look right off your shoulders. the neckline is very high. also, front b
1 I was so excited to purchase this dress; i love all shades of grey for winter clothing, i love knits, and i have loved other maeve dresses. however, i simply cannot fathom how poorly this is designed--it fits absolutely nothing like it appears to on the model, to the point that i wonder if i might have received a defective dress.for reference, i am 5'5", slender and small-boned but also curvy (hourglass). my bust is 36 c, hips about 37-38. i normally wear a small in maeve dresses. maybe it's j
1 This dress comes with a built in fupa. literally there is extra material at the lower abdomen that sticks out and is very unflattering.
1 I'll start by saying, over the years, i get more and more frustrated by the lowered quality of retailer's products. this dress represents all of my frustration. cheap, cheap cheap material. low thread count. elastic!!! around the end of the sleeves that rubs the cheap fabric against your arm. i mean, this dress is a total disaster - and looks nothing like the photograph shown.
3 Love at first sight (via the internet); upon arrival, i was on the fence..the fabric is slinky and loose; so much so that i should have ordered a medium instead of a large(perhaps then the dress would have then been more of an a-line fit vs. an over sized dress with no body).the lower section of the sleeves is attached intricately to the upper arms;every slight movement of the body is followed by a slight tug at the sleeve/arm cloth;otherwise, when the arms are extended, the sleeves do hav
3 Loved the print/pattern and the light grey.....i think it might have been better if reversed (it has a v in the back, and the front neckline was very intrusive and scratchy to me). i'm normally a small but got this in a medium and it was very short on me. wish it could have worked but returning it.
3 This top is oversized. i normally wear large but thought an xl would be best for sleeping. it's huge. so stick with your normal size or a size down. pretty print. fabric is a bit coarse. undecided about trying a size down because i'm particular and they didn't wow me. also ordered these in the lighter color and they fit the same.
3 Well made. made my hips looks giant. just not my style unfortunately. i'd have to work at preschool or on a ship to pull this off. i'm 5'3 120-123lbssize 6-8. i got the size 6 (not petite cuz they were sold out).
1 I didn't have a problem anticipating the fit of this dress. i felt with the drawstrings on each side i could make it work. i usually take a large and even ordered a medium as i had read all the reviews of it running big. when i got the dress, i was beyond disappointed. it is a heavy, itchy polyester-like fabric, not a thin rayon looking texture like the picture shows. it is also a deep black, not the plum color in 4/5 photos. but most importantly, i am 5'8" and the dress is very short on me. it'
1 When i tried this top on, i started laughing. the two rows of ruffles are made of a starchy thick cotton, which, instead of falling by the hips, juts out like wings. it's also huge. cute idea, wrong material and placement.
3 I ordered this item when it was first advertised, fell in love with the unique pattern in the top and could hardly wait for it to get here. however when i received the top i was very disappointed, the fabric is cheap, the sleeves are tight and the overall product is of poor quality and poorly constructed. needless to say i returned it.
1 I was disappointed with the style and quality of this dress. it poofs out funny in the waste and it just looks very unflattering. i'm sending it back.
3 I wanted to love this so much! i am 5'8 and normally do a size large in retailer, but based on the previous review i sized down. the top fit fine, but the bottom just sort of poofed out. not flattering. it does have pockets which are amazing, but overall, just wasn't a good fit. the top is t-shirt material, not denim.
1 I loved the photo of this dress. upon examination of the dress (and trying it on) after receiving in the mail, the dress shown online is nothing like the dress i received save for the pattern. the dress i received has a side zip as well as a belt and no pleats on the top. the bottom is also cut straight across not as it appears in the photo. turns out it is not as flattering as it should appear.
3 I found this dress to be beautiful. only down side? you'd need to size up two sizes if you have any breasts or butt. i'm usually size s/m in maeve. i bought this in l and looked like a stuffed sausage. i'm 5'1", 140lbs, 36d, 39" hips. i'd need an xl.
1 Ordered this vest on line and returned it due too poor quality .
3 I tried on the grey version in store, and it was significantly longer than pictured. the back came down to just below my knee, which looked awkward with the split sides. i am 5'4" and this was a regular (not petite) size. however, the overall quality of the fabric was good and it seemed durable.
1 The color is completely off! i loved the way this vest looks in the picture! i was excited to have that vest but unfortunately what i received in the mail was a huge disappointment. it came wrinkled and the brown is not as rich as it is in the picture. very pale. horrible.
3 The fit is gorgeous, but i didn't realize it was completely transparent. when it says "mesh" it means "mesh"! i was thinking the "mesh" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut, high on the shoulders, you can't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute, but not practical.
3 It didn't work with my frame at all, but is very nice!
3 I ordered the pink, and it was gorgeous. the color and feel were so soft, i would have kept it if it were a blanket. but i did send it back because as a sweater, it just didn't lay right. it has a sort of inside layer that just didn't fit right with the outside sweater layer, so it ended up puffing up on the sides at the waist. that was not flattering. and the hood was too large and floppy looking. too bad.
3 This dress was stunning on the hanger -- on me not so much. i am 5' 1.5" and typically a sz 2. the smallest size at the store was a 4. i felt it was baggy about the waist and the length would have been better in petite sizing. the print is gorgeous with beading accenting different flowers. there is a tinge of green-yellow to the background fabric and the color did not look good on me. i hope to try this in a 4p.
3 Pretty color, great details, awesome stitching.. aaaaannnnnnd it actually not only goes out a line but ballooned out above the hem and then came back in - just too much fabric down below. nice at neck, arms and chest but disastrous anywhere below that.
3 I wanted this top in a petite xs, but it was sold out so i got the xs. i'm 5'2" with a 34b bust, and while the bottom comes down to my waist like on the model, the sleeves are a bit long...they seem a little long on the model, too. i wore this to work and constantly had to pull my top back as the scoop neck kept drooping down as i moved around throughout the day. really like the tie neck feature though.
1 This is a cute top but i wore it for around 5 hours and lo and behold i had smurf skin. i did not sweat in it but the color transferred to my underarm area and bra and it did not come off in the shower!! i guess it's going to have to wear off. thank goodness it was not a hot day!! i hope that i can return it.
3 It is indeed cut to the shape of a trench. however, i think retailer should rename it as it's more like wearing a cardigan. it's soft and pretty which i like. however, i wasn't convinced to buy it since i have a gazillion long black cardigans already made out of the same jersey stretch material.
3 I didn't end up keeping this dress...it just wasn't right for me. it is very cute and fit well but the fabric was very thin (partially lined which is a plus) and the hem line coming up on the sides made it just too short for me. i ordered the petite xs and liked the length in front and back well but the side slit/vent was just too high for my liking. the tie part hit at the perfect spot for me at only 5'4" (~118#). i guess i just didn't "love" it and would rather save my funds for something i ca
3 This dress fit perfectly, i think it fit just like it shows on the model i also think the color represents itself nicely in person as well. i do however think that the dress is over priced. for as often as you would wear this dress (given that isn't a basic black and would definitely be remembered by people were you to wear it more than once) i think the price is way too high. a must have on sale or clearance, but probably not a keeper for me full price in this color combination, we will see t
3 I had to call so many stores to track this shirt down and in the end it wasn't worth it. i got an xs and it was quite baggy. i never buy petite shirts because i feel like they are too short but in this case i think the shirt would have been perfect in whatever the smallest petite size is. for someone who's bigger i'd definitely check this shirt out.
3 Not a huge fan of this dress, will be returning it.fits too big and not flattering.fabric is thin and shows any lumps and bumps you may have.color is not as pretty in person as in the photo - the photo looks like a nice rust color but the dress is actually a boring brownish olive.
3 I love this dress now that it is on sale; sized down to sm petite, added a simple full slip. endless compliments and inquiries on where to buy it!
1 This fell apart after wearing it once. for the price, it should hold up better. it's too delicate.
1 I was very shocked to receive this dress with a rusty zipper, looks like crusty white rust . see attached pictures. the dress fabric is very nice and i did try it on and it is a very nice fit, lined with a little stretch but my gosh what a cheap poor quality zipper that looks like it was old and exposed to moisture because the metal parts have a white crusty substance! retailer you really need to check your merchandise before sending to your loyal customers. lately the quality has been declining a
3 I have several pairs of coh and love them all. when i saw these go on sale in my size i quickly purchased them. however, when i tried them on at home and looked in the mirror, i was pretty shocked that the back pockets were extremely long. meaning, they go well below your butt cheeks (like 3"# which means they look like they are sitting too low on your body-and they aren't they are actually i little higher waisted than most coh! i thought perhaps it was my perception that day, so i waited an
3 This shirt is really pretty but the sleeves are so small. i normally wear between a 4 to a 6 or a size medium and i could not get this shirt on. i wish it fit but a size large would have been way to long and loose.
3 Loved almost everything about this top. the colors are great, comfortable fit, but the length was a little too long for my 5'4 frame. i also wasn't a big fan of the large side slit. i would still recommend this great top.
3 Absolutely love the print and quality is great too! unfortunately, for a well endowed woman like myself, it runs terribly small in the bust and hip region. it absolutely does not look as flowy on an hourglass body type. too bad because it's beautiful! might try sizing up but doubt it will work :(
3 My title perfectly describes my attitude toward this sweater. the print is super cute and the price point is great, but this sweater was so itchy that i couldn't even keep it on for longer than a minute. it may be okay with a long sleeve underneath, but don't even think about wearing it by itself!
3 This shirt is comfortable and looks just like the picture. my only complaint is that it is quite boxy so not very flattering. the colors and details are great. the material is good quality and thick. if you are looking for a light t-shirt this is not for you
3 I can't figure out if this skirt is supposed to be high-waisted (if so, it's too big but the length works), or if it's supposed to sit on my hips (fits well but too long). but the material is really comfortable, and the design is different in a good way.
3 I agree with the other reviewer that the color of this top is more burgundy with purple undertones rather than a deep red like shown online. the fit was very boxy on me and it did not look flattering. i was not willing to to have it altered so i returned it.
3 Like the previous reviewer, the biggest problem with this shirt is how short it is. i'm 5'4 and ordered a 12, which is usually what i wear at retailer. even only being 5'4, this shirt is much shorter than i anticipated. it fits everywhere else, though. i'm obsessed with the back so i'm going to keep it and wear it. i'd say it's worth it at the sale price.
3 This shirt is not what i expected. i ordered the "green" motif, which is not green at all but black. in the product photos the drawings appear to have a white outlining but its brown. the shirt is made of a good quality cotton and fits great. i ordered the medium. which gave me a lot of extra room to where i could have sized down to a small. for reference i am a 36b and usually wear a medium in most retailer tops. i don't plan on keeping this because i was really hoping for a white background to t
1 This is an extremely flattering dress. i couldn't resist buying it, even though i didn't come into the store looking for a dressier dress, which i feel this is. once i tried it on, i had to purchase it. its one of those things that i know i won't regret because at some point, an occasion will show up that i'll wear it to. its soft, comfy and flowing and accentuates the body's curves without being too tight or clingy. its a classic!
3 If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing, but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.
3 So i thought this sweater would be snowy white, but it's actually a beige kind of dingy color. i do not mean that it's unattractive, i do like it, just because it is not snowy white like i thought, it makes it more of a casual sweater in my opinion and i was hoping for a dressy sweater. it is very super soft and is as long as it is pictured. it fits like a dolman sweater which i did not expect either. it's a bit fitted around the very bottom and sleeves are billowy at the top.the picture does no
3 I love everything about this sweater except the sizing. i purchased the deep red in xs. the yarn weight is perfect for me (in los angeles), the length is perfect, the sleeves are bell shaped but not at all a problem for me (they're not so big that they get in my way at all, unlike another reviewer),the collar can be folded in a way that it stands upright for a kind of retro look, which i love. the only problem is that the sweater is way too big. i can handle a wide, swingy style, but with the sl
3 I am 5' 8", 145 pounds with a 32 ddd bust. i typically purchase a small or a 4 to 6 in blouses. this blouse was small across the chest and therefore, i purchased a size 8. it is a nice fit. however, the button placement on the blouse does not work well for someone who is chesty. one button is placed slightly above bust line and the other slightly below. this causes a peek-a-boo space between buttons. therefore, i wear a bright white tank top beneath the blouse and wear the blouse unbuttoned to j
3 Beautiful top, i love the peplum. the color is actually cream with blush accents in the lace. i gave it two stars for quality because the hem was uncut and unfinished so it's going back.
3 Ordered these in 31p last year, prob could have worn a 30p, ordered 30p and 31p this year. the past couple of years the pilcro stet jeans in white fit me because they were cut straighter and not as curvy. this year neither size fit. this year the cut changed and it has a curvier fit. it's the waist that doesn't work for me. if you're curvier this is probably a good fit change.
3 I returned this one. i usually love cecilia prado? s artistic textiles and was very happy with her floraknit dress, but this skirt was a disappointment . it simply looks different from the picture : it?s way more shimmery- metallic in person, (which i could see a lot of customers actually loved), but to me it made it look cheap. also it lacks structure: the a-shape looks drab on this knit fabric.
3 First of all, the fabric's summery pattern of blossoms, honeybees and butterflies is beautiful and absolutely unique. i love it so much i wish i could afford to keep the dress as an art object. also, with one important exception, the dress is well made. the underslip is the right length and opacity. the dress is not transparent,which is a big plus. there is a slight greenish cast to the background instead of the pure ivory shownin the pictures. this makes the color a bit harder to wear. and
3 I tried these on because the color is really pretty and fun, and who donse't want a pair of comfy/cute pants... but they looked awful on my muscular thighs... i don't think the cut will be falttering on 99% of the population. also, not as comfortable as they looked, the crotch seemed a little "low" on me, though the pants were in the correct size.
3 It was just too big in the regular size and too short in petite.  the proportion was off.  i bought a similar sweater last year in a blue color that i wore constantly and was hoping this would be like it. i think if you are very tall you might pull this off. i'm 5,4" and even the extra small regular hung below my booty.
3 Failed to read website description that vest is polyester shearling-lined.that's on me.beware: pockets decorative only.runs a size small due to fact vest is polyester shearling-lined.
3 Very cute and would transition well season to season with different boots/booties.  didn't lay well on chest for me.  returned it.
1 I should have listened to the previous review on-line before ordering. unfortunately this will go back as the design fit and proportions are simply off. i love uniquely shaped wraps like this, but this one didn't make the cut for me.
3 I ordered this dress in my usual size and unfortunately when it arrived, it was damaged and also a little too big. the fabric had lots of pulls in it like it had been tried on many times.i called customer service and requested a replacement in a smaller size. it fit great and looked beautiful but there was a rip in the sleeve.this is a gorgeous dress and very flattering and well fitting (if you size down), but i had to return both and wear something else to a holiday party.i'd only recomme
3 I am a petite size 10 and 5&#39;1&quot;     i love the fabric and style of the dress, but found it to be too much dress for me.  the skirt is very full and with the top i feel it would look better on a thin, taller person.
3 I should have looked more carefully at the description of these before i made the purchase. these jeans, unfortunately are very stretchy which i don't like at all. i was looking for 100% cotton with no lycra-love rigid denim so these are not for me. they have a very nice design and fit tts. they are very long so expect hemming if you are not 5'10 at least! the 29 was perfectly sized and will be flattering on a curvy figure, i would imagine. rear pockets are placed very low on the bottom giving t
1 Ordered on line and thought these are a great quality as i pulled them out of the box. tried them on and found minimal elastic for the waist. within minutes of wearing, the waist fell down past my hips...glad i was at home. looks cute but will not stay up.
3 I wanted to love this dress. the colors are heavenly and it looks light and airy. it isn't, it is very heavy, much too heavy for florida heat. the top layer is a beautiful sand color and while the fabric is nice, the heaviness of the top really weighs the whole dress down. i felt like it added ten pounds to my appearance, easily. back it went, boo hoo. if you are between sizes, i would size down, runs a bit big.
1 I was excited to see these jeans since they came in petite sizes and had a short inseam... unfortunately after ordering/returning several pairs, i found out that these are actually not petite jeans. please beware that if you are ordering these for the shorter inseam, they are actually 28 in... not 24 in as in the description. other than the inseam issues, they fit like typical paige denim.
3 These shorts are just beautiful. with that said, they were expensive, but made reasonable when i snagged them in the online sale! they do also run large, and they seem to be made for short-waisted bodies. i will be bringing them back to my local store to (hopefully) exchange for a smaller size. fingers crossed that they still have them in stock!
3 The detail on this top is beautiful, love the embroidery ! i wanted it to work so bad, but it is much too wide, bells out and makes my size 8/10 body look wider than it is, another reviewer mentioned the model must have it pinned on the sides, because the top does not lay like that. it runs large, especially under the arms. too bad......
1 I tried this on at my local store. i love the look and the color of the blue tank and wanted very much to like it. alas, it was not to be. the material is super thin (almost see-through) and it is of poor quality. i did not buy it.
3 This is a relatively cute top when you try it on. however, i don't think it will hold it's shape after even just 1 wear. it also doesn't seem like you could wash it without ruining it (like a shirt form a 'throw-away' cheap clothing store). i checked the fabric tag and it is a very high % viscose - meaning, it won't last long at all. i'm returning and feel frustrated with how cheap the fabric is.
3 Just a warning, the yoke on this dress has sequins underneath. i'm not a sparkle kinda gal, so as soon as i saw that, the dress went right back in the package and will be going back to the store. i wish that had been described or more evident in the pictures, to me, it cheapens the whole dress, which would otherwise be adorable.
3 I loved this blouse, but had to return. i am 5'2", 127 lbs. 36d. i found that the blouse was tight in the bust and very wide in the shoulders. the sleeves are puffy, which is fine, but the wideness is from edge of the bib to where the sleeve is attached and therefore the top did not lay flat. if you have wide shoulders and a small bust - this blouse will be perfect for you. i liked the material, it was thin but perfect for a summer nights.
3 This is a pretty top but the arm sleeves are scratchy. i have sensitive skin, and had to return it because of this. otherwise, it would have been a keeper.
1 I agree with the other reviewers, this top is completely disappointing in every way, i could not believe it was the same top i pulled from the bag. where to begin,.......it runs really bigit's short and boxy, not at all like it appears on the model, this must be pinned a lot in this picture.colors are completely dull in person, i really think this picture was lightened a great deal.fabric feels cheap and stifflining is stuff and poorly sewn.i haven't one positive thing to say about t
3 This is a beautiful dress. i sized up 2 sizes based on other reviews and it fits well. it is on the shorter side. i purchased the blue and it's a beautiful color. i was in love with the dress until the zipper burst open after wearing it for five minutes. i think i'm going to have the zipper replaced because i like it so much. but at the high price point there should be a functional zipper.
3 I was very excited to get this dress in the mail. i wasn't sure about the sizing because there weren't any reviews written yet. i got the m which fit across my chest area and fit fine, but there was just so much fabric below the bust. i love that it's different, but i think you'd have to be a stick figure for this shape to work for you. it does not flatter your body at all.
3 I got this in the green color. it's a beautiful color, soft to the touch. i agree with other reviewers that it seems very delicate. i don't mind dry-cleaning my sweaters, so that's not the issue. the problem is that a. it runs huge - i got the small and it swims on me. i tend to run between small and medium in tops - very unusual to have a small be so big on me and b. the slits go even higher than they look on the model - they come up to the top of my waist. even with high-waisted pants, the sli
3 Was excited about this sweater but it really didn't wow me when i put it on. the v-neck is quite low and the sweater is a bit short. loved the ideas of the fringe but in the end, it went back.
3 I love the style of this top, and the longer length would be great with leggings and fitted shorts. it's somewhat fitted on the top yet it's a-line shape gives a full swing at the bottom. the ruffled v-neckline is pretty, and i like the longer length of the short sleeves. but with all these attributes, unfortunately they cut the armholes really big, so when you put your arms forward, the sleeves pull against your arms. i was trying to decide if i should keep it anyway, but for $98 dollars i thin
3 I love the style, but it didn't work for me. i ordered the r size. they were way too too long. i generally wear size 26, and the r length works with most retailer pants. with this particular pant, i could barely pull up the zipper. i'm not sure what happened bc i haven't gained any additional weight. i am 5'2, and 110 lbs. unfortunately, i had to return the pants. i think the design is for supermodels. maybe a petite size would have worked? the p was out of stock. good luck!
3 I adore eva franco but these are just not thoughtfully designed regarding fit. i wear a size 12 and took the risk of ordering the 12 as a popback, but they do fit 1-2 sizes small. i could get them zipped but it's not a good look. i feel like the waist would fit if the rise weren't so short. for reference, i have a 33" waist and 42" hips.
3 I ordered a m as the previous review said it ran small. i found it to be very large. i have more curves than the model and also thought it made me look boxy.
3 I thought that it looked like it belonged on a 15 year-old. i can almost see why they styled the model in what looks like ankle socks....ready for cheerleading. for reference it fits true to size, but is very short. i am 5'2" and tried on a regular small - it was at least 5 inches above my knee.
1 This dress will unfortunately be returned...so cute online and looks like a sack in person.  runs very large, arm holes are very low.  not flattering.
3 I'm 5'6'' , athletic build-thought it was cute but in the end didn't like the color of the inner sweatshirt--wish it was black or white. send it back.
1 Totally bummed. the pretty print doesn't outweigh the very odd fit of this dress. makes you look really top heavy and even the print, which looks so cute online, looks muddled in person. sadly, went right back.
3 Love the colors, love the design, and sure to keep you toasty. im usually a size 0 or 2 so i ordered an extra small- it felt a bit roomie
3 Very pretty and has potential. only down side - i thought it was more like a cardigan with sleeves but it's really more of a shawl and the photos and descriptions are misleading
3 I was so excited to try this dress, but after ready the reviews,i though they were all over the place! i descided to order my typical retailer size small. i'm 5'6" , 134 lbs, and wear a size 6. well, it was a snug fit! i have a slim build and this was just to snug for my taste. i imagine a medium would have been better. however, i was very surprised by the length and slit... the dress hit at my knee cap with the slit going all the way up to mid thigh... .!?? i've seen pics of this dress on instagr
1 I was looking for a casual dress for quick errands that was trendy but comfy.  this dress had a lot of potential [i was drawn to the print]  but the material is awful. so thin and scratchy! immediately went back.
3 I was hoping to wear this dress for an engagement photoshoot but it fit terribly. i'm 5'0, 98 lbs, 32a, and have some hips/butt. this dress (ordered xxs petite) hugged my hip/butt region tightly, which made the dress ride up and balloon out around my stomach and back. there was also too much extra room in the chest, so sizing up was out of the question. there is just way too much fabric and it's very stiff with no drape or shape whatsoever. i felt like i was wearing a cardboard box. the sleeves
3 I'm still on the fence with this shirt. i have the grey - it almost looks like a cheetah design up close. i'm 5'3"
1 I tried on and bought this shirt in my usual size and it fit long and loose but still had great shape. after hand washing in cold water and air drying, as per instructions on the tag, the shirt shrunk significantly. so much so that my stomach shows if i raise my arms at all. it also lost its shape, and now looks very boxy and is very unflattering. i won't be wearing it and am disappointed i didn't even get to wear it once!
1 The dress is beautiful in pictures, but all the reviews are dead on...it was full of snags when it arrived! 8 snags to be exact. and the fabric was heavier than i expected. sadly, had to return.
3 I bought this online in my usual size (petite xxs) for in-store pickup. when i tried it on, the kindest word to describe it would be "voluminous"--it was at least 2 sizes too big on me. i looked like i had taken grandma's tablecloth and constructed a homemade blouse. the blouse comes with an attached cami, which was also way too big for me. the color is not white (as described), but rather an ivory/cream color--definitely not the best shade for my light olive skin. i do think that it looks lovel
3 I ordered this top because 1. the online product page states the fabric is cotton. 2. i liked the style with the scarf insets. 3. the colorful embroiderey would be a welcome companion for my many pairs of pilcro chinos.when i opened the package several tiny round beads rolled out. after examining the detailing, i found where the beads were missing.size: i normally wear a small for most retailer brands, but i know nothing about slone rouge. i went with a small since it appears oversized on
3 I did not realize that this knitted vest had an attached gauzy under-layer. i can see it now in the photo, but i just thought it wasn't part of the actual vest. when the vest arrived i realized sadly that this flowing under-layer was part of the design. i don't know why because the yarn and vest are lovely without it. in my opinion, the under-layer takes away from the beautiful vest. i guess i could have spent some time and removed it, but at that price i just sent it back. too bad because the m
3 I love this dress! the print and the fabric make it a fun, uncomplicated outfit choice that can be dressed up or down very easily. that being said, there are two issues i wish i had known about, although i probably would have purchased anyway. 1) it has pockets -yay!!! but also, the pockets create a bulge where they hit my hips and it's not a flattering spot on me to have an extra bulge. 2) i washed before wearing because it was super wrinkled and me and the iron aren't friends anymore. so i thr
1 Noticed all the 5 star reviews online for the latest pilcro stets- so due to the past 2 years of dissapointment of what was once a great pair of jeans....i was hopeful that retailerpologist listened and went back to the original pilcro stet formula- thick denim, just the right amount of give and a flattering 10 inch rise. walked right in and found them- and i knew right when i touched them- they were still the thin denim that's nowhere near the quality they once were. consumers pay attention and t
1 The fabric is a little stiff, the back looks unusually long compared to the front, and it fits tight across the chest. and i'm not busty so that's not a factor.
3 This dress is only suitable for a beach cover-up: it is completely sheer. expensive, even on sale, for something with such a limited wearability. i returned it.
3 Bought this in the store and fell in love with it. very soft and flattering to wear. however, after wearing it one day it is already starting to pill. this truly is a beautiful sweater, but i fear it will not be beautiful for long. i am willing to take the chance as i got it on sale.
3 This sweater dress color is great and texture is nice however ran huge. read the other reviews before ordering and ordered down to a medium and was just to boxy and could not get it to hang well. unfortunately it went back.
1 I do not even know where to begin with this product. i ordered a small (i go between small and medium) and felt that would be a good fit. after trying on the shirt, i would have opted for the xxxxxxxxs or whatever the smallest size is. this shirt is very boxy. i know its supposed to have a 'flow' to it, but this shirt is too much. it needs to be taken in. or have a belt wrapped around it. i tried the belt look but it did not look flattering. i found this color to be very blah. overall, i am slig
1 I loved them on when i got them, but they literally frayed apart on my body as i wore them, and i had them on no more than 5 times. it was not a fit issue or a seam issue; they literally just frayed apart in two areas.  while flattering and incredibly comfortable, the fabric was not at all durable...they are not your typical  denim,  they almost kind of a knit feel them.
3 I loved this dress, i usually wear a petite but went with regular based on the reviews. i workout and it was snug on my arms.. fabric felt great, loved the fringe.. just a but snug in the arms for me.
1 This is a great dress if you don't want to leave the house or you want the world to see your nipples.
3 The skirt is very pretty, but it's not as dark as the street pictures which i like those colors better. it's also super long. it will have to be hemmed if i decide to keep it. for reference, i'm 5'7" and it was sweeping the floor (size medium). given the price, i'm not certain i will keep it. i'll try it on a few times, then decide.
3 This top fit nicely and was tts, but the pattern was different than i expected. i thought it would be more of a desert scene and it turns out there are cowboys on it and it just didn't fit my style. if there were cowgirls on it i would have kept it.
3 I so wanted this blouse to work. the lacework is beautiful, and it is a substantial and well made top. the neck fits well, which is not a given for this style top, and i really like the 3/4 length sleeves. but the top billows out like a tent on me in all directions, and it was an awkward length on me (not quite hip length, not quite tunic). wish this were cut a little straighter and longer. i'm 5'4", 120 lbs and tried a size s.
1 I was able to get this on sale. when it arrived, it was missing half of the rhinestones. i am very surprised that this top would be sent out this way. it also was missing the little bag with extra stones. i'm reaching out and wondering if anyone else has experienced this and is there a store that sells rhinestones like the one on the blouse? any help from anyone would be appreciated. i hate to part with this, but where was quality control?
3 Agree with other reviewers: this runs narrow in the skirt. the top is also quite low-cut, and it's already lined so i can't see wearing a cami or slip. i like the black-and-white print and the shape, and might have tried a size larger in the store. finally, it's an awkward, unflattering length. i'm 5'4" and it hit below my knee.
3 I fell in love with these online. i thought they would be such a nice piece of statement denim. unfortunately they did not work for me. i am 5'2" and the waist of these paints was four inches away from my breasts. it didn't look bad from the back but from the front it was comical. the denim itself is nice and heavy but, like the previous reviewer stated, not a dark wash. the pair i received was a medium whiskered wash. if i was taller these would have been a yes, despite the wash discrepancy.
3 The positive: light-weight fabric, interesting drapethe negative: i'm tall and would have preferred if it was longer. the big drawback is the ridiculous buttons--three fell off the first time i wore it...and it fits loosely! they're held on by a single loop...ugh.
3 This runs huge, not large, huge; and hung in quite a baggy way. bought a medium ( 5'10, 150 lbs) and i could have gotten an x-tra small. maybe if there were free shipping i would have reordered, but now its just too much of a hassle
3 I wanted to love these, but the zipper is extremely short and they were not flattering on my thicker thighs and large behind. the fabric is so soft, however and the color is great. would work on a less curvy woman!
3 Purchased because i wanted a deep red sweater, and this one was the perfect color. unfortunately i am on the curvier side, with 34g chest, 155lbs 5' 5", and the med was too big, (i usually wear m or l at retailer.) also the fit ended up being boxy on my body type.
3 Loved the idea of this but content felt too thin and sheer.
3 Pretty top online - okay in person. runs small, especially on bottom hemline. thought it would have a swing to it. it does not. more sheer in person than i thought it would be. that wouldn't stop me from keeping it though. it was the way it laid on my chest that was unflattering. looked like i was wearing a bib. i don't have a large chest, just weird look on me. unfortunate, because it is an adorable print. top made for thinner or a petite lady.
1 This top really is lovely. i had high hopes of it looking smashing with black jeans. i wash everything before i wear it. though this garment says it needs to be dry cleaned, there was nothing so delicate about the fabric that it had to be dry cleaned. so i hand washed it with delicate soap. when the lighter colors came into contact with the black, the black immediately stained the light color. i tried putting some stain remover on the black stains, rinsed and hung it above my bath tub. it is cur
3 I love love love the soft fabric and the cozy cowl. however mine not only had a giant hole, it seemed like the yarn started pilling as soon as i touched it. love the idea, but not practical, even without a hole =)
3 Very pretty dress and nicely made (the embroidery is quite lovely and double lining, as mentioned by the other reviewers, is awesome), but not a good shape for me and my hourglass figure. like a lot of swing dresses, it has no structure, and it's not a good look on someone a little busty, as i am. in all honesty, i thought the sack-like shape of the dress made me look 20 lbs heavier than i am. i am a medium, size 6-8, and took the 8 based on the other reviews. i probably could have sized down to
3 I was so excited to get this top! i love the bow at the neck and the frill sleeves, so current. unfortunately, it was difficult for me to pull it over my head! the neck opening is too small, and there are no buttons. i have a pretty small head and very fine straight hair, so i can imagine that others will have a similar issue getting it on!i am keeping it because i love the style, but will need to alter the neck myself. the rest of the top fits just a bit loose.i got the x-small and am a 3
1 Super itchy! had to return.
3 I tried this on in my usual xs (5'5", 128lbs) and it fit like a dream. i was instantly in love. until i looked from the side and realized it was cut up way too short. i have a longer torso and shorter legs and this came up past my finger tips if i stood with my arms down. no way could i wear this as a dress. as a tunic definitely though, but i was really hoping to find a nice, versatile fall dress. it was a let down but i still may consider purchasing it because the material was so soft and it f
3 I'm usually a 6 in dresses and the 6 here fit okay. loose but still flattering a little long for a sundress. i was unhappy with it looking a little frumpy and being so loose under the arms all my bras showed . i took it back to the store and after reading the reviews here decided to try the smaller sizes...well multiple dresses later i ended up buying a size 2 petite!!! and i'm 5'9". the 2 reg and petite still had the loose gathering look to the top but both fit much better under the arms so tha
1 I am not sure who would look good in this dress. it is extremely oversized with tons of fabric that will not flatter anyone!
3 Such a cute dress but it runs large. i'm 5'4" 130 lbs and am typically a size 4 can wear a size 2 in certain clothes. i tried on the xs and it was still too big. i would of bought it in an xxs but they are sold out. really a comfy laid back dress that would be comfortable in summer. if they get more xxs i'll buy it.
3 Looks so cute in the picture, but just didn't really look that flattering on - plus the sleeves were too tight and too long for my short arms so going back....
3 Great colors and not too voluminous. lined whig will be great for fall but the downsides are the huge elastic waist bc it'll require a belt or something over it (looks v casual alone) and even with a perfect fit it gives a bit of muffin just bc it's a huge piece of elastic. i've literally tried this on on two occasions trying to convince myself it it. lol but it's not worth it at the current price.
1 Large and the material is too bulky. i returned it.
3 I ordered this sweater in a medium with high hopes. i'm 5'8" and slender, but with a 36' bust, and the medium was too loose and long (sleeves fell past my wrists). i would exchange this for a small for a better fit, but the color is not the white or cream color i was expecting. the color of this sweat is more of an oatmeal - not flattering on a far-skinned blonde. i think the color would look fantastic on someone with dark hair (as it does on the girl in the photo). the texture is great and i re
3 I ordered these hoping they would look like the model - but they didn't. i am small but curvy. it hugged too tightly in the hips so sadly, these pants are going back.
3 I really wanted these jeans to work but i am too curvy and not tall enough for them. i just felt like they were swallowing me up with fabric. i am 5'5" and had a stacked boot heel on when i tried them on and they were still too long. i felt like they made me look even bigger than i am. the fabric is nice, not as dark as the photo as others have said.
3 I loved the fabric, cut and style of these shirts, the diamond gather in the front is a problem though. i just went under and snipped the elastic that is sewn on that design to relax it a bit. this shirt washes and wears wonderfully. please make again maybe fix the diamond area so it is not sewn with as much continuous elastic, a space in the sewing on both sides would alleviate that pucker. sill i love this top
1 As another reviewer noted, the upper portion (back, chest, shoulders, etc.) fit nicely. however, the body of the dress was enormous and did, indeed, make me look much heavier throughout the middle. back to the store it goes.
3 This is so so soft and has a nice stretch to it. the fit is great, love the side zippers. i wore it today for the first time and before i even arrived at the office i noticed a crazy amount of pilling where my purse rubbed. nothing i cant get rid of (till next time i carry a bag!) but if this keeps up there soon won't be much of a shirt left. very disappointing for the price. was lucky enough to snag this on sale but it was still pricey for the quality.
3 This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back, and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping, and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this, but as it is i will keep the one
3 I ordered this after seeing the rave reviews. it is not for me. just like the culottes i ordered, this romper makes me feel like a grandma. i said i'd recommend to others bc of the other reviews but again, this was not for me. i also didn't like the back of the romper. no way i could even get away with a racerback bra b/c it's so low cut. the good though- it is super comfortable and is a nice heavy fabric. tts also. i'm a med 8/10 and the medium was correct in this.
1 This sweater is a dull off white color. it looks old fashioned. don't get.
3 This jacket is beautiful. the color is so nice and the cut of the jacket is perfect. however, one i put it on, i couldn't wait to get it off. it's so itchy!! i tried putting on a long sleeve shirt under it but was still uncomfortable. especially around my neck. i wouldn't recommend this jacket based on the material alone. also, the jacket runs large. i'm 5'1" 130 lbs 34d and i ordered the small. i would definitely size down.
3 I got this top in my typical size medium and wanted to love it...it is such a good idea and i loved it on the model! however, it failed in translation for me, and i will be returning. the bottom of the top is very loose, but the top clings to my chest (36dd), pulling awkwardly and gapping on the sides. not worth exchanging for a large, since the bottom of the top is already to loose..
3 This top looks adorable in the product photos, so i had high hopes. i think i might be too short to pull it off, but like another reviewer said, i found it to be like a tent on me, billowing out in all directions. it was just overall too big on me--i even considered whether i could wear it as a dress, but the sleeves were also too billowy on me. i am 5'4", 120 lbs and tried the xs.
3 I absolutely love the look and fit of these jeans. i did have to size down. i ran into problems after washing. the fraying on one leg was twice that of the other, looking very unbalanced. after looking closely i found that one leg had a top stitching very close to the fray to prevent further fraying. the other leg did not have this stitching, thus the fraying double in size. i have sent a request to customer service for a replacement pair. these are adorable jeans just be sure to check for stitc
3 Wish i'd noticed that the sleeve cuff and hem were 'cut' to look hippie-casual. i'm taking this back with great regret. it's soft and the prettiest pale lime-sherbet color; made for a cool summer look. i don't like 'tattered,' though - so back it goes. sigh. it's soft, true fit, and beautiful. i'd buy it in many colors and in the lovely lavender print if it wasn't for the 'cuts.'
3 The colors look better in person and the sweater knit is thinner than i expected (which is actually a plus in my opinion) so i was very happy when i opened the package, unfortunately the fit was off for me. the lower part and the back are perfect, the dress hangs nicely, no puffing, no stiffness. however, the upper part at the front was tight and something about the armholes made my arms and upper body look beefy (i promise i usually don't have this problem). i am 32a and routinely order xs. the
1 I wore this blazer for one day, didn't do anything strenuous, and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back, next to the center seam. it's completely unfixable, since it's not the seam that split but the fabric itself. what a waste of money.as to the fit, it is a boxy cut through the waist. it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned. the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it, so it's good over something cute.or, it would be, if it didn't fall apart.
3 I love the pattern of this shirt but there is definitely a design flaw in the arm/armpits.
3 So i was super excited to get this skirt, unfortunately it's not what i thought it would be. the color is much different then what pictured, it has bronze threading and the black on the picture is more gray in real life. the material isn't so great easier, i thought it would be thicker but instead it's pretty thin and wrinkles easy. the design is very cute and it is a flattering shape but the material is just too poor for me to give this a good rating. i wouldn't say it's itchy like the other re
1 I really wanted to love the shorts.  when i read that the shorts were lined, i expected them to be lined so that my underwear didn't show.  even though the shorts are lined, you can see through the fabric completely.  this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design; pockets; and, comfortable waistline.  i'm returning the shorts as well.
1 This dress had so much potential. the top was absolutely gorgeous. my issue was with the bottom half of the dress. the bottom is made from a heavy quilted material that is stiff and has no movement at all. the dress is supposed to fit like a modified mermaid dress where its more fitted around the hips and flares out, the dress i received had so much material on the bottom that it actually made my hips look bigger. i though about having the dress altered but decided to return instead.
3 This is so bulky and itchy...could not stand to have it on! i'm a 6/8 & ordered the small, but it was still gigantic.
3 I couldn't believe there weren't more reviews complaining about the arm size... then i found them!  yes, this is a cute shirt, if you have toothpicks for arms!  so true!  the shirt is adorable... a bit guazy (so not going to be super warm for fall/winter... but i live in cali so that's not an issue).  but, my arms aren't even big, and this shirt is so snug around my arms!  unfortunately it's going back :(
3 Nice jeans, just fyi they look more slimly fitted in the photo than they actually are when you get them. that's why i returned them. otherwise, fine.
3 I really wanted to love this dress. i thought i might be able to dress it up for a wedding i'm attending, but it was kind of a serious no go. first off, i ordered a petite size, but it was still longer than on the model--i'm 5'5', so not even technically petite, but i thought it might be a better length for me that way. it was not a great length, and the pleats and pockets (which would be great in theory) make the skirt fully (and pouffier at the waist) than i would have liked. i love the way th
3 I was excited to receive this top because i love the design, but was very disappointed when it arrived. i thought the embroidery would be striking but it's not. the material is a t-shirt knit which also added to the disappointment. it was not flattering at all.
3 This is a bit more jacket-ish than i expected. the material is kind of scratchy, and it was heavier than expected. it has a lining in it, like a jacket lining. i wasn't a fan of the clasps on the front. i guess they are meant to be invisible, but they are literally little metal clasps. it is more cropped in the length than i expected, and i don't have a particularly long torso. i like the embroidery. the pattern is lovely. the fit is about spot on. i am about a 12/14 with a 38c bust and the l fi
1 I'm 5 ft 7 125 lbs true size 4 and these pants made me look like i had boy parts. super disappointed!
1 I wanted this dress so much, i ordered it twice. both times the zipper was defective--it would get stuck midway up, at the waistline--so i had to send it back (there isn't an retailer in my area). this is a shame because it's got great colors and looks flattering on, and i was looking forward to pairing it with a cardigan/boots for fall. i even thought about taking it to a seamstress to have the zipper replaced, but the cost didn't seem worth it. too bad, as it seems like it would be a nice
3 This dress (i ordered the ivory) is stunning. it is fully lined, the belt adds a needed accent, and the print on the fabric is gorgeous. the fit, though, is another issue. i typically wear a 2-4 depending on the cut and fabric of dresses, and am pretty proportionate with my hips/bust. i ordered a 2 in this dress. it was enormous on the top and painfully tight on my hips and thighs. the fabric has absolutely no give - it needs to drape perfect or it looks awful. if you have any type of hip, thigh
1 This dress looks lovely on the model, but it looks just awful on me!i am 5'4" and curvy. the shoulders are cut w/ a weird shape. instead of a cap sleeve, it is like a pointy cap on the side and stuck out on my shoulders. it looks like i am ready to get beamed into space.the material is nice and the sequins are pretty, but the cut of the dress is unflattering.
3 I was excited to receive this top and wanted to love it; however, the side ruffles flared out more than i expected. it didn't look right on me so had to return it :(
3 I agree the light colored portion of dress is not vanilla; it is more beige color. i liked the dress a lot, it had a flattering fit on me, extremely comfortable and then i noticed the black mesh portion at top of dress. it did not lay flat at the outer sides between the mesh and floral fabrics like the picture. it poked out on both sides at least 1" which suddenly made the dress look cheap and ill fitting. i can guess either the mesh pattern piece was not cut correctly or it was not sewn correct
3 I was very excited to try out this dress. i've been looking for a velvet dress for a couple of years now, and.. i'm not digging this one. the fabric itself was a let down right off the bat. it's cheap looking to me. i've seen nice velvet and this is very shiny, thin, and slightly sheer! the dress cut itself is what i was expecting, a loose baby doll type dress. the length hit above my knees. the overall effect made me feel very "gypsy-ish"...my husband gave a firm no! when he saw me walk out of
3 I didn't fall in love with this jacket but it was comfortable and seems like it has potential to be flattering on many body types. for reference i tried on a medium and my measurements are 38-30-40.
3 This runs a bit on the large side. i ordered my usual m and had room to spare. the green color was lovely, but between the fit and the scratchy fabric, this is headed back. too bad!
3 I liked that this was a unique take on a sweatshirt. pretty seam down the back and weight of material. i'm going to return it because i wish it was a little more of a loose/baggy fit and under-pattern is darker than i thought.
3 Great looking shirt that i bought for my wife, but poor quality. the fit is great but the buttons literally keep falling off. first time my wife wore it two buttons just fell off. when she was sewing them back on she showed me and another button just came off with the slightest tug. its really too bad because it looks great otherwise.
3 This top looks much nicer on the model than in-person. i tried it on, it didn't look flattering and was shorter than i like. in the picture i really like the top with the design and frills on the side, gives the model a waist. in-person the design doesn't stand out much and the frills look wrinkled.it is also sweatshirt material and a tad stiff. i am sending it back. it just didn't look as flattering. also, it seemed more fitted at the top than bottom.
1 I love the colors. however, $200 is a lot to pay for a small piece of fabric , no lining what so ever. the fabric is very thin. you will need a slip. looks just like a cover-up. going back.
3 The sleeves are a bit too voluminous and the solid color collar stands out a bit too much.  but it's a cute pattern and style.  very comfortable.
3 Why does the lining stop at mid thigh when the skirt is long? makes product look cheap while wearing. love the color, the fabric, and the fit, but cant get past this less than quality feature - will be returning.
3 I wanted to love this dress because the fit is so flattering and the color is so great however i could not get the button along my bust to lay flat. normally this can happen if the fit is too tight around the bust but i promise there was still plenty of room. the fabric just bent in a way that left a gaping hole at my bust. unfortunately it's going to have to go back.
3 I really liked this tshirt but unfortunately the v-neck is just too low for my taste. it fits really loose and even buying the xxs i just felt it would stretch out and be even bigger. really cute style just not sure it's worth the price. great colors though.
3 I agree with the first reviewer. this dress is just ok; nothing to write home about. if you need a throw on dress in a pinch, it's nice to have on hand, but there are probably a lot of other retailer dresses that fit the bill that are better quality than this one. it is also very body conscious in the back. the material is a thin, ribbed rayon - on the cheap side. overall, it's a comfortable piece, but it's more like a thin, long-sleeve t-shirt, rather than a quality dress. it would have been a gr
3 I did like this dress. it has a good simple shape, and is very comfortable. however, it's plain, and for the price and it being dry clean only, i'll wait to see if it'll go on sale. it's also worth noting that i'm 5'2" and was uncomfortable with the length of the petite, but the regular size was a good length (right at the knees).
3 Cute shirt but not worth the price. i did purchase it at 20% off but would have waited for a better sale. the yellow is a nice fall color
3 This sweater has potential, but it wasn't right for me. the collar isn't flattering on me...too thick, and my shoulders are already broad. my waist is high, so i need a longer look. the color is true to size, but it's s little see through...dark bra shows through.
3 This immediately caught my eye in the neutral pattern, and the fabric is actually quite nice. the fit is at least a size or two too large though, with the bust being way too large for me even sizing down. my normal 4 was big everywhere, and the 2 was still big in the chest, but fit everywhere else. the belt is handy for cinching in some of the loose areas, but the top section just didn't work for me. maybe better for someone better endowed?
1 This dress looks like it could be cute on but when you put it on its just blah. i saw someone else trying it on in the fitting room and she felt the same. not cute, not flattering, the model photo is deceiving. would not recommend, although it looks airy and comfy.
3 I liked the colors and the design but it's kind of an odd fabric, no give at all and no drape. stiff and kind of structured feeling for a casual cardigan. the sleeves are extremely narrow and tight. i ordered a medium and it felt like a ace bandage squeezing my arms. my arms are normal sized. if you have exceptionally narrow arms, might work for you. sending it back.
3 Gorgeous design, but it was just so heavy. i felt overwhelmed by the amount of fabric, although this is my fault for thinking i could get by in regular sizing as petite was sold out. will be returning
3 The snake and the studs, they make the dress. sadly, the snake is hard to find, as mentioned in another review. this dress also runs large, i'm usually a 12 and went down to 10. the images are misleading too. two pics show a small, fitted look, and the other two show a full, swing look. i'm trying to make this work but it may have to go.
1 Luckily i bought this on sale... i now see the instructions online say to hand wash, but i bought mine in the store. the instructions on the tag said to wash delicate in cold water and tumble dry. i washed it in cold water and it shrunk to doll size.
3 Runs a size big unless you want it really boxy. felt the matl was flimsy and would prob pill soon. turquoise was a pretty color but returning this one.
3 I was really excited to see what this looked like in person. when i unpacked this shirt i was shocked to see what how short it looked. the colors are very close to what you see online but the shirt is super boxy. i have a smaller torso and it barely came to below my waist. you can't tell by the picture but this shirt can fit at least 2 people in the width. when i tried it on, it didn't look as boxy but still a really weird cut! it was disappointing because it looks so cute online! i will be retu
1 These pants are gorgeous when you first see them. they fit beautifully when you first put them on. and then you wear them for one day. and they snag. on everything. and little strings start to come out of the pants. and the hem begins to unravel. and the pants which were once beautiful light summer pants appropriate for work or brunch are now frumpy, worn out pants with a million snags and strings hanging off of them .... after one day. i can't begin to tell you how annoyed i am that i spent
1 I ordered a size smaller prr other reviewers but that still didn't prepare me for the sweater's issues. it looks really cute but the quality is pretty horrendous. i wore it for the first time today and already the sweater is pilling a lot on my back. seriously heartbroken.
3 I only gave this three stars due more to personal preference than to any real flaws with the product. it is very comfortable and for a jersey-style shirt quite warm. but that is one of my issues with the shirt. i wanted to wear it well into spring and i think it'll be just too warm. (i live in the northeast) i also felt that while it fit tts it had a more generous fit than what i expected, which was another negative for me. i wanted it to be more fitted to my body. however, i did keep it because
3 This runs really big. i usually wear s or m so i got a small but i need the xs in this top and it is sold out. i don't have a store close by (about an hour away) and i hate paying shipping for returns! i will either have to plan a trip to the store or try to exchange for size over the phone. i debated keeping the small but it is really too big .... i love the style though!
3 While the styling is cute, the fit was poor under the arms and there was quite a gap. i returned this.
3 I love the look of this sweater and was so happy with how it looked and felt when i first tried it on, but within a day of wear, i noticed significant pilling, which made it appear much older / worn.
3 I'm a size 28 jeans 5'9 with a bubble bottom. these were falling off of me around the hips. these are warm. i was expecting them to not be sheer since they are fleece lined but when i sat down i was shocked to notice it. it doesn't matter functionality wise because i never felt a "draft." they look good and are well made but i will be returning due to the lack of fit.
1 This jacket is just too small for me anyway and i am no way big. i am tall and athletic and this thing looked like it had shrunk in the wash. there are so many better fitting other types out there, this went back
3 So comfortable and soft but starting pilling after one wear! sending back.
1 I am 5 6' and 130 pounds and ordered this in an xs. the sweater is enormous. the material is also scratchy and not soft at all. i'm disappointed with retailer's sizing this year. i've had to return a # of xs items because they are huge. really disappointing.
3 I really wanted to love this everything about this piece. especially after reading all of the great review i was so excited and looking forward to getting this dress. unfortunately it just did not work out. i ordered a large and it fit fine but the dress did not give me the faltering shape i had read about and was hoping for. it literally just hung on me and made me look wider. sadly i had to return this.
3 Really wanted to love dress but something was off with fit. fabric is lovely and zipper detail nice unfortunately style was not for me.
3 Cute dress- flattering and seems to be well made. however, when i received it it seemed that it had been worn. the bottom was all dirty and it had a white mark at the top. called and rep said they would send new dress if i send first back, so hopefully that gets here quickly and in good shape. the other dress i place with my order hasn't even shipped and the rep couldn't tell me when/if it would.
3 5'7", 34c, 28 jeans, 4 dress. ordered a small and a medium. never tried on the medium. the small was a little big in the waist, but what threw me for a loop was the chest. huge! could work if it's meant to be blousey, but the armholes were massive. if an xs is returned, i might give it a shot. but i can't imagine what women who are smaller than me are going to do in this jumpsuit. great color, transitions into fall easily. cannot be belted or wear a camisole due to the opening at the stomach. sh
3 I wanted to love this but if you carry your weight in your hips, butt or thighs this is not the dress for you. runs tts. i'm 5'5, 135 lb and the small fit but made my lower half look even wider than what it it. also felt like it was a bit too long in length.
3 This was so ridiculous on me. i'm 5'8" 120 usually a 2/xs. so i ordered the xs. the inseam of the shorts are so short they barely cover my bum. and i mean barely. the romper itself was so wide that two of me could have fit in it.  love the colors, fabric, and the non-elasticized waist. if you are under 5'5" this might work for you in non-petite sizing.
1 This is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer, but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear. this brand makes some of the softest, cutest tees, but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry. not worth the cost.
1 I feel in love with this piece. the color are gorgeous and i received so many compliments. it lifted my mood just wearing it! sadly, ut the end of the first wear i had a run up the front and by the middle of the second wear the light fabric got caught on something and a hole developed. upon further inspection i found another hole at the top where the price tag must have been attached. i also noticed all over pilling after the first wear! so sad! they should recreate this in a heavy fabric.
3 While this top has a lovely design, neckline and color the metalic threads made it too shimmery for me. i actually think it looks better in pictures than in person because of the metallic threads.
3 1. i'm 5'5" tall, 140 lbs and 38 (36d) - 32- 40. i'm normally a size 10 in most brands, and in maeve in the past. this dress was too tight across my waist and hips in a size 12, so it runs very slim.2. this dress is very long waisted, so the top bunched up funny.3. the horizontal bar in the back is in the wrong place, and will not hide your bra strap.4. there are bra strap keep loops in the shoulders, but this is an off the shoulder top.5. the underarms bunched funny.6. the dress has h
3 I purchased this sweater because of the cute unique diagonal design. however, i was largely disappointed by the fiber of the sweater, it is rather coarse to the touch and a bad fit. on the model it looks nice, but it was large around the torso, yet short at the same time creating an awkward and unflattering fit. i shall be returning it.
3 As other reviewers have noted, the fit of this tee is very boxy.  it looks okay tucked-in to high waisted jeans, but otherwise is unflattering.  also, the color is described as black, but mine looks like a navy blue in person.  i kept the shirt because i live overseas and returning it would have been difficult, but if able to, i would have returned it.
3 This design looks really sharp on the image, but in reality this jacket felt more like a jacket you would get at forever xxi.  the fabric had that polyester/shiny quality to it that made it look cheap.  since the fabric was pretty soft, with a gray jersey lining, it felt more like a padded jacket than a constructed blazer.  i also thought the cut was small if you have a bust larger than a b, i felt like i was busting out of a size 8, and i am a 34d.
3 I really like the idea behind this top, but at least for me, the execution wasn't quite there. i was hoping it would be something i could wear to work, but the sheerness of the sides makes it in appropriate for my workplace (when it gaps/you move, you can see a lot). if you don't move, the front panel is pretty opaque, which is good. i think it would look odd with a cami underneath and i don't feel comfortable with the sheerness, so i returned it. i also thought the finish on the sleeves looked
3 I think i received a mislabeled vest?? when i opened the package, i thought it was some sort of joke!  i was expecting what the stock photos show, a longer length flowy sweater vest.... mine was literally child sized. i'm not a big person at all.. i'm 5'6", 135 lbs, and wear a 6/8. i ordered this in a m/l, thinking i would like it loose. i tried it on thinking, maybe it will look longer once on.. no.. not even. i looked ridiculous. the front hit above the waist of my jeans and the back hit middl
3 Cute, but didnt realize it was sweatshirt material. due to that, returning.
1 These run very small!! they are also short, almost like a crop pant. the fit was so weird that i won't even exchange for a bigger size.
1 Very cheap looking material. looks cheap to cost $158.
3 This blouse ran so short in the body it has to go back. it would not cover my stomach untucked or tucked in. it's unfortunate i think it would be very beautiful and flowey.
3 I loved the shape of this sweater. the way it draped from the waist was flattering and different. the sleeves were a strange length, however, between long and 3/4 length which made it look like they the sweater was just too short for me. the color looked peachy or pink in the photo, but in reality, it was almost skin tone, which was not flattering with my olive coloring. paler women might find it attractive. the real downside for me was the fabric which was thin with the flowers mainly printed o
1 This dress had so much potential. looked cute when i received it. put it on & couldn't wait to take it off. it's shapeless, top heavy & just overall unflattering. the material could be cute....on a totally different dress. don't waste your money.
3 I only tried on the ivory one, but it was so see-through, there was just no way. i can't speak for the other colors. seemed true to size, maybe a little large, but that's the style. very cute design, loved the back. too bad.
1 It's the inverted invert ... not so obvious at first but then it shrunk and was harder to ingnore.
3 I ordered a small and i'm usually always a small. i could not zip it up. i'm am returning it for a large, and this is concerning because what if it is big in a weird way because i'm usually a large?
3 I just got this in the mail and was so excited to try this cute top.....but it's completely see-through! unlike the photo shows, the lining is not included. quite a disappointment top is well made though no give in the fabric.
1 I found that this dress ran very small. i am true 8, ordered a 10 and it was snug
3 I originally bought this shirt in the blood orange color, which is lovely and vibrant. the shirt is extremely comfortable and very flattering. however, it is also very, very cheap. after about five washes, it has pilled and worn, the color has faded a bit, and i doubt it will make it through the spring. for perspective, i wash all my clothes on cold and use the "air dry" setting on my dryer.nonetheless, even having experienced the wear and tear, i went back and bought this shirt in every other
3 This skirt was cute on, but not particularly flattering. i thought the denim was a little too stiff. typically, a-lines are flattering on my figure, but this was a miss.
3 These are the very stretchy, almost spongy, type fabric.  i ordered my usual size and they fit me like a sausage skin.  crazy small!!!
3 Another shirt i really wanted to love. i adore green but so few tops are made in this color. (please make more!!) however, this shirt didn't work for me. i think it's a matter of where your curves live. the shirt was true to size, but my boobs meant i was showing more cleavage than the model, and the top part felt more like a bib than embroidery. sad coz it is lovely and feels lovely on. probably a great shirt for different body types. would love to see more green clothing....
3 Wish someone warned of the navy one being not as pictured!! i ordered the navy because the crocheted part appeared to be more intricate than the ivory. in reality the navy knit is just like the ivory. it seems well made but very delicate. i'm not a fan of tops (especially pricey ones) that require a camisole but this top is a very "retailer" piece so most likely i will keep it, just a bit disappointed.
1 This looked fabulous on the model, of course, and i love sweater dresses. but even in an xs, i was drowning in fabric and looked ludicrous. concept is good but execution went terribly wrong somewhere. a definite return.
1 Ag jeans have been a main stay for me. they are the most comfortable and best looking jeans on my body. however this pair was too tight and shorter then i liked. the fabric and color is beautiful. i wear the same size for ag no matter the design. but this one ran too small. i have to return it. i will try the next size up if they still have them.
3 I was so excited to receive this sweater in the mail since my local store didn't carry it. it is a very cute design if you have a smaller frame but i'm curly up top and it didn't lay they way it did on the model. there's plenty of stretch. unfortunately the fabric sheds and itches terribly. you could wear a shirt underneath but i'd have to wear a turtleneck so it'll be going back.
3 Saw this tunic on line and when it was immediately sold out i thought it had to be a winner. after several days of trolling on line the 2p was finally back in stock. now comes the disappointment. yes, the material is sheer but would be a nice weight for humid summer days. the front looked exactly like the model. cut with high side slits that truly made this a tunic. the back of this tunic is some sort of origami design. the fabric bunches out at the butt area. it's bad when you're standing and i
1 I ordered this dress in the green color. the dress did not look like the picture. i returned the dress since it looked like something to wear to a farm barnyard dance. i returned the dress.
3 Loved this dress until i tried it on! it was too big in the body and tight on top in the arm area. from the reviews already posted stating the guy was great, i'm wondering if i just received a defective dress? i also wish the dress were a truer orange/mango color instead of a burnt orange since this dress is for spring/summer.
1 Looked good in pictures. i even ordered an xxs petite and it was huge! although the sweater has interesting textures and is very beautiful, it is very awkward and poor fit. will be sending back.
3 This is super cute and the colors are so vibrant and its thin enough to wear with tanks for the summer but it already had a hole forming in the upper back shoulder.  i guess the material was a little too thin....$98 is a little too much money for something that gets holes so easily!
3 I really wanted to love this t and was excited to receive it in the mail. i thought i was being realistic in assuming that is would be somewhat sheer given that there doesn't seem to be a woman's white t on the planet that isn't these days, however it was really sheer. the fit was also short and boxy (this coming from a 5'3 woman who is short-waisted) on the plus size the material is extremely soft and the design is cute. maybe if you are younger and don't mind the sheerness it's worth the gambl
3 This vest is very nice and fashionable, very stylish. i like it a lot. however, it is too itchy. the opening in the front didn't allow me to close as many buttons as i like but i would totally wear this stylish vest even though it is not as functional when it is cold. however, the itchiness is too much. i don't wear wool unless it is ultra soft or mixed with cashmere, so i could not imaging wearing this vest, it is too itchy. why ruin such a good thing?
3 Such a cute dress it was just way too big in the back of the dress, too much fabric, it just hung withno form around waist. it appeared more fitted on the model than the one i received. dress was quitea bit longer in the back so i felt like the front was riding up just in the minutes of trying it on. sadly i have to return it. it did come with an underneath slip which was necessary as the fabric was verythin.recommend with caution to sizing.
3 This top runs small across the top. i was amazed at the material--polyester, i am sure--because the price was so high. it has a sheer layer underneath, which i think would make it hot in the summer. i love this kind of tank but it just did not look as good as it does online.
3 I'm 5'7, 125lbs, and the small fits perfectly. the sleeves are the right length (i have long arms and legs), and the body fits loosely, without looking sloppy. at my height, the small is not long enough to wear as a tunic, which is fine.unfortunately, the shirt arrived with makeup stains around the laces and the inside of the shirt, so i had to wash it before wearing it.i only purchased this shirt because it was on sale.
3 I love the shape at the neck but the lack of shape really distracted me from loving this top. the fabric is nice but the big, boxy shape on the bottom doesn't do much for you. i agree with the other reviewers tha this top would be great as a maternity top because it really is cute if you have a baby bump. returning the top.
3 I have mixed feelings on these. i ordered the honey which is a mustard color as shown in the picture. they are true to size, cute, and comfortable. i washed them the first time with a load of darks and the color ran onto other clothes. plus the pants looked a little streaked in some areas. i'm not sure if this was a bad lot, but back to the store they went.
3 I feel the same way about this shirt as i do about the sungarden tee. it's a lovely pattern and i like the fit (it's not clingy), but it's a bit see-though. it's not as bad as the other tee, but no contrasting or patterned bras can be worn with this shirt (unless that's your thing). that said, i'm happy with it because it's a soft and pretty shirt that will get a lot of wear in warm weather. i am very glad i got it on sale though. i wouldn't have paid full price for it.
3 Run large and leg is very wide. even sizing down, they seemed too floppy.
1 Even at a very deep discount, this piece is definitely not worth the money. the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design (which would be cool)--which is largely what attracted me to it, but as i discovered when it arrived, that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo. so this image is rather misleading. the actual jacket is very thin--more like a shirt with an open front than a jacket. the pockets are just loosely tacked inside. for
3 This dress had so much promise from the picture. i loved the midi length, color, and fascinating waist detail. i ordered online, so there was no way to try on before purchasing. the fit was disappointing. it fell in an unflattering manner at every point; a tad too low at the waist; a tad too long at the shin. just kind of saggy all around. bummed, but this is not to say it wouldn't fit someone with a different body shape better. the quality of fabric is nice, and the color is lovely.
3 I was very excited when i saw this in a perk email and immediately went to order it. unfortunately, the stock image of this pullover is misleading. it's boxy (image makes it seem like it's form-fitting) and the weave/mesh is much thicker and open in person. as shown, you do need a cami underneath. i ordered this in a small and medium since it's an online exclusive and there were no other products by on the road to see reviews of to know how their tops fit. i wanted to love this. i didn't think i
3 I loved this dress and ordered it online. i found the colors to be a bit more muted than i expected, and unfortunately the fabric quality seemed low considering the price point. ultimately i decided to return it as i couldn't justify spending $178 on a dress that didn't seem as well made as i would expect from retailer.
1 I loved how soft this dress was, as well as versatile. however, i only got to wear it one time because after the first wash, a giant fabric tear happened on one of the seams. unfortunately, the fabric is so soft, but rather thin, and it didn't hold. the care instructions say machine washable but i wouldn't put it in the washing machine again. especially since i often have to wash clothes twice in the washer i use because it's so old and barely agitates. would love this if it was made a little be
3 I bought the pink one. i like this salmon pink color! not too girly type of pink.the material is super soft and light. i have skinny torso, so it looks really nice on me not showing thin body...the only thing that disappointed me was it shrunk after the first wash... it shrunk one size! when i bought it (size s), it covered my flat hips, fits just like the picture, but now my hips are showing :(i recommend getting a size up if you are too lazy to wash cold & air dry.
3 This is a gorgeous dress. i got the red version. it's stunning...the zipper is trash however. i'm scared of getting stuck in it like another reviewer.
3 The quality of this shirt is great and the colors are pretty. it just made me look super wide. i feel like the waist is too high - not quite empire and not quite at the waist. it just wasn't going to work for my body. maybe a different size would work but i don't like it enough to try.
3 Ordered size 12, it fits but pulls a tiny bit in the midsection. also way too long, hits below my knees. the dress is beautiful: crisp black color, nice fabric, great neck. it's also the kind of dress that must fit well to look good. i had to return mine.
3 I tried this sweater on in the store. i wanted to love it so badly as it is soft and feminine, and would be a great causal layering piece. however, there are pockets in the sweater that are right on seam, and they actually bubble out from the natural drape of the sweater. not to mention, unless you're built very narrow, the pockets will fall at, and accentuate hips, and not in a flattering way. the nice details are the feel of the knit, the layered style, with a cottony lined hood and "faux" lay
3 Ordered this in xs my normal size (5'5" 110 lbs) and it was huge! did not particularly care for the style either nothing special.
1 This top is beautiful in design, but sadly, i will be returning. it is hand wash, and even after doing so, i had 2 unraveled threads resulting in large holes. unfortunate since it was so flattering before washing.
3 Cloth and stone has been getting a little shotty lately in terms of quality. they used to be a pretty consistently high-quality brand, but lately i've been left a little bummed. i got this in "yellow" which is really a muddy orangey color. i think i would have gotten over the less desirable color if the fabric were better, but it is actually two very thin layers of fabric that are stacked and snag easily (sort of like a soft cheesecloth). the shirt is definitely comfortable and cute, but the qua
3 Just got this in - love the color and fabric, but it has no shape on me. i thought i'd wear a large because i have a 36ddd chest, but i should have gotten a medium, at the largest. also, even if it did fit, it came with a stain resembling toothpaste right in front. i'll be returning.
3 First, i absolutely love this dress, and i was super excited when it arrived today. i sized up as other reviewers recommended, and the dress fits perfectly. however, when i zipped the dress up, the zipper came apart in the center. going up another size would make the dress fit improperly, so i am hoping to exchange it for a new one and have better luck with the zipper.
3 I ordered this dress in coral. while i like it and the dress is nice, i have many other outfits that i like better so this will be going back to the store. i might have kept it in black or blue.
1 They ripped on the inside upper thighs of both legs less than two months after purchase. i've washed them once, and wear them a few times a week, so they're certainly not worn out. i've never had a pair give out even close to this early. i loved the cut of the jeans and the softness, and they hold their shape well after multiple wearings. the color is lighter than pictured. i paid full price (the most i've ever paid for jeans) because i'd heard good things about jean shop quality. even at sale p
3 After eyeing this product online for awhile, i was able to try it on in store. i'm so glad i did, because while this dress is lovely, it is clearly not designed for my body type. i have a small rib cage and a large bust (32h,) which is i think what caused the keyhole to be so gaping on me. additionally, the straps of the dress were up by my neckline instead of lying properly on my shoulders, which was unflattering and left my bra straps clearly visible. the fabric was gorgeous and soft, and the
3 This shirt has beautiful coloring but the material wasn't as soft as i thought it would be. i was hoping they would be the super soft material, maybe washing them would help, but i didn't want to chance it so i returned them.
3 This dress is so pretty in the photos but in person it's huge. and not in a way i could adjust by sizing down. the shoulders and arms fit but the body of the dress is absolutely huge. i normally love a trapeze dress but i was swimming in this so it was quite unflattering. it was also much longer than it looks on the model. i'm not short - in fact dresses are normally a bit shorter on me than the average person but this was just frumpy.
3 I took this too to the register thinking it was marked down to same price as another tee by the same brand. it wasn't so i ended up paying way too much for a thin tee. will probably return.
1 1. i like a shorter jacket, but this one was poorly made and poorly fit.2. the sleeves were way too tight. i'm a size 10 or 12, and the large which would be a 14 had tight sleeves that wrinkled up my arms, and the hem of the sleeve turned inside out.3. i ordered both a medium (size 10) and a large (size 14) , and neither hung right. the m too tight, and the large too loose in the body and too tight in the sleeves.4. very polyester with lots of static.5. cute idea, but not very good in pe
3 The pink version of this top finally arrived -- nearly 2 months after ordering.  the expected delivery date kept slipping.  the color is not as shown online.  online it looks like a light pink.  the actual top was more of taupe color.  it's a basic tee with pretty ruffling at the bottom.  not enough to keep.
1 I really wanted to love this dress, but i couldn't. it ran large and heavy. rather than a sleek cocktail dress, it felt more like a heavy sack once i put it on. there was one upside: the drape in the back did not appear to drop quite as low, so finding a bra to wear under the dress might be easier than if it draped as low as it appears in the picture.
3 Love the print, length, and cut. but the tie waist hangs in a weird way and seemed like it would stretch out and sag after a while. sad to return it.
1 Agree with other poster. this shirt runs very big. i'm all for a flowy, shirt that hides my belly but this is just a tent. i'll be retuning it.
3 I have been looking for a quality pair of black skinny jeans for a while. after reading the reviews, i had such high hopes for these jeans. i bought it in my usual size 28 and while the top part fit perfectly, i found that the bottom was too tapered in and ultra skinny making it not look right. sadly, i had to return.
3 As other reviewers have noted, this is a pretty top. i really love the design. alas, however, it is too big for my frame. for reference i am barely 5'1" and about 105 lbs. i ordered my usual xxsp and the fit is just not flattering on me. it is looser than on the model and the flounce does not hit me in the proper place. the top is also too wide so that it has these odd gaps near the armpits. i highly recommend this top unless you are an xxsp. i am going to have to part with it, sadly.
3 As another reviewer mentioned, maeve really needs to get their sizing under control and more consistent. i ordered a 4, and while it fits, i think a 6 would be more comfortable in the arms and shoulders (and i'm a thin build). the length on this was also a little weird to me...a little swingy/flared, but also short, making me feel like i'd always be playing with it while wearing. the orange print is absolutely adorable, i just wish the cut were more similar to past buttondowns that maeve has don
1 I keep trying to find a peplum that works for me, but so far i have been unsuccessful. i just do not think that my shape and the peplum shape play well together?aside from the peplum issue, this shirt had a massive amount of material and runs large. the material alone is thick, making it a bulkier shirt, then add the volume of the peplum and i looked (and felt) huge. needless to say, this one was returned, sale or no sale.
3 The outer layer runs large up top; also, the orange stitching (the flowers) on the outer layer are extremely bright orange rather then a fall brownish orange that would match the layer underneath. i'm returning it because for the price i don't love it.
1 I wish i had read the reviews prior to purchasing. this skirt looks amazing in photos and lace appears black. the lace on mine is actually purple - at first i thought it was just purple due to lighting with red underneath - but nope - pull the netting away and it is purple. lace netting hikes up on the right due to poor craftsmanship. i ordered a medium and felt it was a bit large. will return.
3 This dress was so lovely in person, but when i put it on...ooh la la! it is short! i am 5' 3" and i would not walk outside in this dress without something underneath. it just needed one more tier and i would have kept it for sure. too bad!
3 This is a cute dress, but just not a keeper for me. the top portion of the dress is fairly snug. i am normally a small in retailer sizes, but i would have sized up the keep the dress from pulling so much across the bust. otherwise, it was cute and simple, and the tulle was quite soft.i think that i would have gone with a medium, but i am wearing a small in the photo. for reference, i am 5'5", ~135 lbs, 34c, and 27" waist.
3 Got this on sale in black and red, and have only worn the black. quality is poor, seems to stretch out over the course of the day and loses its shape somewhat. a smaller size may keep its shape better so you may want to size down. not worth full price.
3 This model looks like a bauble head. she is absolutely too thin and sends the wrong message out to retailer shoppers. this last catalog's models are anorexic and unhealthy looking.i ordered this shirt hoping it would fit, but it's too small for 34dd. i am tall athletic and have breasts. i think of my shape as average - and the top didn't fit. it's cut narrow and small.
3 This runs small, i got the size 3 which fits like a medium, not a large. its a bit of an aline shaped knit in a beautiful saturated navy. i loved the elbow length sleeves. i have a large 34g bust and although this fit, it came to the top of my waist and i'm short-waisted. it's a great basic for someone less busty or who likes a shorter length.
3 I wanted to love this set, but sadly it just didn't fit as i had hoped. the small was bigger than expected and looked frumpy and not sexy. returned.
3 Thought i'd love this top; i'm a sucker for lace anything from retailer.  but i found the lace, while pretty, to be quite rough, which to me indicates a lower quality. and i guess i should've known that it would be very swingy (photos show that) but it really overwhelmed me.  for reference, 5'5", 125 lbs, 34d. sad, but this went back.
3 This piece is lovely if you do not plan to use your arms, or if you are a t-rex. if you are not a mannequin or a dinosaur and actually plan to use your arms, this top may not be for you.
1 I am almost always an xs in bottoms (sz 0-2) but literally couldn't get the stretchy waistband (no zip or fastening) in xs up my hips. in addition, the "brocade" is a very lightweight polyestery, tinselly weave--does not suggest quality. as others have noted, it also runs short; i'm 5'3'' and this was a little below knee length on me, not ankle-length. i've had luck with retailer's sale section in the past, including some items that didn't always start off with the best reviews, but have no regret
3 I like this shirt, as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts. however, after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans. so: good if you don't like long t-shirts, bad if you are tall, like me (5'8") and don't want to wear a crop top.
3 This is a beautiful and well-made top; sadly it just didn't work for me. i'm 5'1 with a pretty short waist and even on me it was too short. the shortness might've worked if it wasn't as baggy as it was. i don't mind baggy, loose-fitting tops, but this was so much so that it was just unflattering; it looked a bit boxy as well.
1 Loved the colors but the fit was less to be desired. very wide under arms & too much material. looks more like a maternity dress. i ordered a small petite & would have needed the xs but now it is no longer available. oh well. returning this.
3 I like how this jacket is very versatile. you can wear it to work, or play. it does have interesting detail on it, i kept it based on the price and those details. i have the olive color. the arms are a little tight.
3 Wore this romper 1x and after washing, the hem on one of the shorts/legs completely unraveled. if i want to ever wear it again, i will have to bring it to a tailor to get fixed. unacceptable for a $200 product. cute design and good fit but questionable quality.
3 I ordered this top online in two colors, and kept the berry color. i liked it while trying it on. when i wore it an entire day, the top just didn't look that good. it wasn't flattering, and it focused on the bad areas despite being loose fitting. it didn't seem very flattering. i wore it for one day and am not happy with my purchase. i wish i could send it back but i already wore it. the fit just isn't very flattering. it is loose but focuses on the curves not in a good way if you are curvy.
3 Originally bought the plaid version and retuned it to order this one in the store to get free shipping. the fit is completely different. i am a consistent small, particularly in dresses of this style. will be exchanging this for a medium, which i hope will fit. love the color and pattern.
3 The fabric and design are gorgeous so i was hoping the top would work for me. sadly, it looked ridiculous on me. i wouldn't recommend the top for busty girls. it looked like a bell on me. fyi, it doesn't come with a camisole underneath.
1 This is a very soft and comfortable jacket but it has holes in the pocket area. it was returned to the store and the other jackets had the same problem although not in the same area. the store was considering pulling the product off their shelves. it is unclear if the holes are just the beginning of a pocket or what. but it was flawed by everyone who looked at it.
1 I'm normally a small in retailer tops. i ordered a small, and the top fit well in the shoulders and in the upper (more fitted) part. it all went horribly wrong from there. the top billowed out at the bottom and fit like a circus tent, instantly adding a good 50 pounds to my frame. this was such a disappointment, as the pattern is beautiful and the fabric is high quality.
1 This dress has pretty colors. the top fit well but the bottom looked like an upside down umbrella. it has enough material to make 2 skirts and the big pockets on the sides make the skirt stick out sideways. the photo of model is from side, not the front. very unflattering on me.
3 Still can't decide if i want to keep this. it's super comfortable but much thinner than expected and the color seems more navy blue than black.
3 I usually follow the boho look, and this dress appealed to me immediately and it was in the color i wanted black. so excited to receive this as i knew i could wear it both as a dress and a tunic but that was not to be.the outfit consists of 2 elements: a tight fitting slip that fits awkwardly and does not give enough room in the bust nor waist areas, and an overlay dress that is really quite pretty. but it too was too tight across the bust area which made the entire upper torso ill fitting.i n
3 I love this sweater, so why a lower rating? while i love the material and the color, it lost all of its shape before i even left the house! i am a size 6 / small and it looked clownish on me before i ever got to my dinner party.  i plan to wash it this evening and i really hope that this brings it back to its original shape and keeps it.
3 I was quite excited to find this tee in the store. the design looked interesting and it seemed nice on the mannequin. the bright red color really stood out in person. i am 5'2", 34b, tried on my usual size s and it was humongous! although the sales lady found a size xs (they don't have size xxs available in the store) for me to try on, it was still huge like a tent. it probably would fit better for a tall body figure. i would recommend those who are interested in this tee to try it in the store,
3 Great jeans by pilcro, too short and snug around my knees for keeping though.
1 The photo misrepresents how large this sweater is. it is giant! petite ladies stay away from this sweater. i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs, but this just floored me. the neckline wouldn't even stay up on my upper body, it was that loose. also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model. it is like a tent. i'm so bummed. the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft. it's too bad it doesn't fit smaller women.
3 Gorgeous but just too short in length for anyone with a long torso.  i sized up to get more length, but then the neck opening was way too big and hung open to expose - well, everything up top.  wearing a cami would be an option but would take away from the dressiness of the top.  i had to leave without this item, but was disappointed because i love the colors and cut otherwise!
3 So many things to love: love the mod kind of style, the forgiving pleats and empire waist and the fabric quality. but the neckline is just way too deep. if they didn't pin the one on the model, i'm a monkey's uncle. that super low neckline takes what should be a nice day dress and turns it into something you can't really wear in a church or in front of your dad. i seriously considered altering it, but the waist is already so high, i felt it would ruin the line of the dress.
3 Looks great on the model, but if you're curvy it looks very frumpy.
3 This is a lovely dress that i would consider to purchase if the dress is lined and the key hole is not deep. tts
3 This dress is a good casual summer dress. the material is thin and feels nice on. the dress was very wrinkled when it arrived but that came out very easily and the fabric doesn't really wrinkle easily after initial wash and steam. the color is very vibrant and the fit is loose. however, if you have a larger chest (i'm a 34c), the hook and eye closure dones come undone. overall a good purchase. it looks good with a belt as well.
3 I really wanted to love this tank top.  it has vibrant colors and a unique pattern; however, i should have listened to the reviews.  there was way too much fabric!  it made me look pregnant!  the tank top is going to be returned.
3 This dress is pretty and is somewhat fitted in the bodice. it does have an a-line fit in the skirt. the stitching is beautiful. honestly the stitching was a little too bright for me. some may like that, but i was hoping for a little more toned down or muted. the colors are so vibrant in my opinion it almost cheapens the dress. the fabric is cotton and it is not lined. i am 5'9" and it does hit right about where it does on the model. i am sending it back, because i didn't say "wow, i love this" w
3 Love the colors in this top. it's a shame it was so big and baggy i'm not that big a person but really made me look big and frumpy . i am 5'6", 130#. athlete. size small was way too much material for my frame
3 I would have to wear a camisole underneath this, which is odd considering it's still two layered in the front. i wanted an easy white shirt to wear, not something i'd have to layer.
1 I made the mistake of ordering without checking the reviews. cute design but not as comfy as it looks. returned immediately.
3 Beautiful victorian look blouse. runs large and overly blousy on me.
1 I thought it was only me and immediately assumed i needed to go on a diet when i attempted to put this adorable skirt on. it got stuck at my hips. i'm a very consistent size small in dresses and skirts. i actually thought about putting it on over my head but that was impossible. its going back. now i see the other reviews and am relieved that its the skirt and not me! wish i had read them before purchasing. retailer is going to get a lot of returns on this one.
1 There are darts that are not shown in this picture that make the dress ill fitted. not sure why they are not in the picture and on the dress. i wish the pictures shown were more accurate.
3 This was going to be my go to top. i loved the look of the billowy shirt, especially in light blue. when it arrived, i knew it wouldn't work for my body. i'm athletic build with muscular upper arms and a d cup. i tried it on anyway. i really wish it fit. it was snug in the upper arms and pulled a bit in the front. i knew if i ordered a size up the arms would still be tight. it's just the cut of the shirt. this top is best for someone that isn't busty and has slender upper arms.
1 I ordered the shirt bc it looked soo cute despite the fact many said this shirt was see thru. it's true.. had to return it
1 I love the idea of this top, but there is just way too much fabric involved in person! i'm 5'2 and usually wear a small or medium to accommodate a fuller chest. i ordered a small and it fit fine around the chest but the huge swing hem combined with the slightly stiff fabric is just enormously unflattering. i feel like they could have made about 3 shirts out of it. i think the picture must have it pinned a ton in the back, the silhouette is nothing like shown. if there were just less fabric, i wo
3 I think these are amazing for anyone over, say, 5'5". the way these hung on me (at 5'2") were very unflattering in the front. they had an unfortunate masculine effect to them. that's all i can say without being crass.
3 I loved this dress and was hoping to keep it. but, for an a-lign dress it was not roomy enough in the hips and the waist was baggy. i think this dress would look great on a very very slim build with straight hips.
3 This was just not flattering for me--looked too much like a maternity dress. i can't really do a belted waist so perhaps that would make this dress more versatile for someone else. i was sorry to have to return because it goes well with sandals and boots!
3 I ordered this top because i liked the look in the back, however, the top i received looks nothing like the back. online it shows that the back has elastic & is gathered. also online it shows thin straps (that look like a bra strap) but my top has no thin straps & no elastic~ extremely odd!! i called customer service but the lady i spoke to didn't have any information or complaints about the top. i'm holding on to the top because it is cute from the front, but i was really wanting the back to lo
3 I ordered 2 dressed in 2 different sizes. neither fit... both were very tight... runs very small.
1 The material that was used to make this top is very thin and poor quality. it feels like the type of material that will disintegrate after one wash. i normally wear an xl and this top is huge and not flattering. returning asap.
3 I love this dress, but it is too short to keep. i am 5'8" and weigh 124lbs. most of my cloths from retailer are either a size 4 or a small, but this dress is substantially shorter than other dresses purchased from retailer. it looks adorable on, but it is just too short (about 3 inches above my knees) to be considered professional enough to wear to work.
3 I adore this blouse, but the cut is a bit weird. the shoulders fit snugly and the body is blousy/boxy. the colors are super cute and the cutouts are unique but i don't think this top is for everyone.
3 I thought this was so cute online, sweet and feminine, but when it arrived and i tried it on in my usual 12p i felt like i had just stepped back into freshman year of highschool - it is very early 90s - not the bohemian i was going for. it is also very high waisted, even for my little 5'1 frame. i truly felt like they pulled this out of someone's closet, dusted it off and said, ta da! as much as i love rachel and monica i have moved on from their clothing :)
3 Slouchy relaxed fit. well sewn together and hangs well on the body. bottom hem hits upper thigh. good length and soft, easy fabric. light layering option as well. good spring jacket, can be kept on indoors without getting too hot.
1 I had my eye on this dress for months. i came into some extra cash and bought it at full price online and picked it up in the store. the purple pattern is nowhere near as soft as pictures. it was very bright which disappointed me. it's also made for more busty women. at a 34d i could in no way fill this dress out. the result made it look so frumpy and unflattering. i felt like an old lady in a bag.
3 First of all, the colors are really pretty, fabrics feel really nice. but.... the fit was no bueno. i think if you are tall and small chested, this dress would look great. but i'm short and large chested and it was very unflattering. when the fabric transitions from the stripes to solid, it doesn't hang nicely due to my chest. sadly this is a return for me.
1 As much as i buy from retailer, this is my first review. the pictures do not accurately show how large this dress is in person. i wanted something that was a bit flowy, but this was a reminder of little house on the prairie. the most unflattering dress ever and since it's only available online, i'm not interested enough to try a smaller size.
3 I was very disappointed to receive this and to note that the blouse has no ruffle down the front as pictured. there is no ruffle anywhere on the blouse. i am likely still going to keep it because i like the pattern, but the ruffle was what interested me for a cute work blouse and i want other shoppers to know that the blouse actually includes no ruffle when you order it.
3 The fabric felt beautiful, and it felt great on, but once i looked in the mirror it just looked too housedress like. maybe because it runs large. the price seemed high as well. i wanted to love it but i had to return.
3 This dress is a bit scratchy, but overall i liked the fabric well enough. on someone blond and fair, the peach color washes out a bit. the issue for me with the dress is that front is just too short for my height (i'm 5 9 1/2). it looked a bit obscene. the small otherwise fit me great. i have broad shoulders, small chest and and slim.
3 It gets a little old to receive products over and over that do not match the photo or description of the product, retailer! the photo shows a black pant with blue colored striping. the pants that i got are black with green and brown striping. i find the color combination in the photo to be what i wanted and since the fit was nice (albeit short and i'm only 5'5" tall) i would have kept these. unfortunately, the pants that i got are nowhere close to the description so i will be returning them. the f
3 Runs very big.  i ordered a l and need a m.  unfortunately no medium left!  great top with lots of character. hate i missed this cute top
3 I have a love hate relationship with this product. it is comfortable and cozy, yet unshapely. after the initial wear, the product begins to stretch out, and if you sit for a while your knees are demarcated in the fabric once you stand. the sherpa front is soft, but the waffle material in the back is in no way flattering. i purchased for sleeping so it does that job nicely, but i would never leave the house with this on. i am hoping that after the first wash it shrinks a bit too. i am typically a
3 The vest looks  so stylish on. it makes a regular t shirt look edgy with it on. i love the vest but the price is too high
1 I bought a pair of these in stone and after the first wash they become all splotchy. i chalked it up to perhaps there was bleach leftover in the my washer. although nothing else in the load was blotchy. i then, because i loved the cut of these pants, bought another pair in the darker blue color. the same thing happened after the first wash. again, nothing else in that wash load was the least bit ruined -- just my new retailer pants! such a bummer-- definitely a dye issue. i called the stores i pur
3 Like the other reviewers, i agree that this sweater is waaaay shorter than it looks on the model. i think she's wearing a large size and it's probably cinched in the back. still cute, though! i'm 5'9" 145 and a medium fits well -- looks cute with high-waisted jeans (which i wear anyway).
1 Bought two of these because i loved the way they fit off of the rack. washed them according to directions and they were ruined. the material shrank up making the shirt short and boxy and the side panels ended up being rippled. definitely going to try to return these.
3 I was so disappointed when i received this top. the color is some washed-out faded version of the picture shown and the cut is much fuller than it looks in the picture. the back is cute but not worth the awful, drab actual color.
3 I'm a vest lover of all shapes, lengths and styles so i had big plans for this vest.  in the end, the pockets ended up ruining the lay and line of this vest.  they are too bulky and end up pulling at the front of the vest, drawing your eye to the pockets and not the neckline.  i agree with previous reviews that it could be worn into spring- i wouldn't wear it in summer.  the fit is loose, i thought the medium arm holes were large for my frame- 5'8" 140#.  overall i sent it back.
1 Very disappointed. ordered two sizes, the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i wouldn't have worn it and the zipper was sticking. the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked. some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under $100 but at $228 they are not. returning both sizes.
3 This sweater is fine for the casual days. i bought this in cream and i have to say after one wash it looks old. i'm a huge retailer lover and buy a lot of clothes from them. this is just not the best quality and looks tired after a few wears. very soft, but poor material. not my favorite purchase.
3 I had high hopes for these as coh is my favorite brand of denim, and these crops were made specifically for petites. also, i was happy to see they were described as a straight jean, not a skinny. the fit and sizing seems to be a little off. i ordered my regular size in this brand, 27p, but they were too big. sized down to a 26p. they were still too large in the waist (seemed very stretchy) but fit well in the legs. i like the fact that these crops were made for petites so the length was perfect,
3 I wanted to love this shirt but it quickly lost shape and a hole was created in the middle of the shirt after just a few washes. not worth the price. poorly made. you need to wear a shirt underneath bc it is so thin. the shirt looks better int he picture. i like it but it wears terribly.
3 Love the color and style, but material snags easily
1 I was so looking forward to an awesome maxi dress.  this was not it.  completely see through.  i guess you could wear it as a bathing suit cover up.  but be prepared to knot the length or you will trip.  its an odd design. absolutely not worth the price.  i purchased the sm/md and i could have for two of me in the dress. returned this piece without looking back
3 I ordered my normal size 6 in this dress and could barely get it on. it runs very small. i would suggest going up a size or maybe even two sizes up.
3 First of all, this top is brown and light beige. i was expecting more of a dark grey and cream. it also has very noticeable stitching that is a very reddish brown. cute, but a little different from what i imagined. the fabric is a casual linen. regarding the fit, i am 5'6", 123lbs. 27 inch waist, 32d. i ordered the 4 and it fit well. as other reviews have mentioned, the straps are long so the top of the shirt hangs fairly low. i did not find this to be flattering. it made my bust look low and my
3 I purchased the stripped blouse and it was very large around the armhole. it bulged open as if it needed a dart. i even washed it to see if it would shrink to fit and it was better but not good enough. i hate my bra showing through the armhole. it's going back. cute blouse except for that. i love sleeveless blouses with turtlenecks.
1 I absolutely loved this top. it fit great and was easy to dress up or down. i wore it once and washed it according to the tag. cold water and flat dry. it is now 4 sizes too small and unwearable. extremely disgusted.
3 I'm an xl in retailer tops, and the xl fit as expected in this blouse. however, the elastic cinched in such a way under my bust that it did not look flattering. the cut in the sleeves hang open too much for me and makes it more of a costume. i also had issues that the chiffon type sleeves did not match the color of the knit fabric used in the rest of the blouse. the blouse is a good quality, but there were too many other issues for me to keep it.
3 I did not have the same experience as the reviewers. this shirt is not what i thought. the front is low cut and i would have to wear something under it. i could not wear this to work, and i would not wear it in public. the fabric isn't bad, but feels flimsy.the fit is tight. i wear a small, or xs in most shirts, and this was ordered in a small and it was tight. i did like the green though, and the color in person is nicer than what is pictured.
3 Loved the style, ordered my normal m- fit tts though i thought i would potentially taper the sides to make less boxy (with a larger bust and shoulders, boxiness is unflattering). the slight boxiness looked perfect with stretchy, fitted business slacks. midday, i held my ipad up to my chest and the velcro from the cover pulled an entire lychnis delicate threads. not just snagged- i had to gently separate the threads from velcro grip. needless to say, it pulled the threads out by at least 1/2 an i
3 I first have to agree with other reviewers about the quality of this sweater: the stitch is pretty, but the fabric isn't nearly as soft as i expected. it has the look and feel of a cheaper sweater. that said, the fit is pretty flattering. i didn't have any problem getting the cowl over my shoulders as pictured by the model. i've been looking for this style of sweater, so i'll probably keep it. however, it really didn't meet my expectations for quality.
3 Beautiful - ordered a s, i wear a 2 in most retailer items. hand washed in cold water, shrunk inches, yes inches! love maeve clothing, this shirt is gorgeous. before hand washing in the sink, it was large and flowy. now it barely fits.
1 Really wanted to luv this top buttt it ran small in arm length & in the front, bottom...backside was perfect coverage...also most important this top is see-through! item as pictured is not accurate!
3 When i saw this, i ordered immediately thinking it was similar to the popular colorblocked stripe sweater from last year. the knit is stretchy and textured and feels like great quality (would wash well), but it's pretty lightweight. the fit is huge...could easily size down. i'm 5'7" 128# and found the small to be loose everywhere, including the arms. the length was at my knees, and the stripe fell awkwardly across my chest. no idea what i'd wear this with even if it fit better. sadly, it's going
3 Ordered this in white, thought would be really cute. but didn't like, and returned it. i am big busted and it was unflattering teh way it draped.
3 I am all for a cute flowy tee but this one felt like i was swimming a bit. if you're a true xs, i'd skip this one. however, if you are able to size down i think it would look really great!
3 Was really looking forward to this sweater, but it's not a cardigan, it's a poncho. i can't decide if it's fun-quirky or just odd. it's gorgeously made, and extremely soft, but i do wish it was actually sleeves. i haven't decided if it's something i will wear or not. my husband referred to it as "batwings." that should have been depicted in one of the photos.
1 I was so excited about this top, and so disappointed when it arrived today. the lace part is lovely, but the skirt part is a crinoline type fabric that balloons out at the sides. it is gathered at the sides rather than pleated, and there is no way to get it to lay flat. the back center section is pleated. why couldn't they have had the pleats all around? this will be going back with much regret.
3 I loved how this jacket looked online and decided to order it. however, sizing can sometimes be tricky for me so i ordered both a petite xs and petite xxs (i'm 5'1", 113 lb, and a bra size 32 c). i tired on the xxs first and was swimming in it! so naturally i thought the xs would be even bigger; but to my surprise the xs fit way more snug! in the end, i still didn't like how loose the xs fit so i returned them both. the material is great quality and it's a cute design. i would recommend trying t
1 I have been continually disappointed in retailer's clothing for the past year. i feel like their prices have soared and the quality has remained so-so, but dresses like these somehow make the cut. it does not make sense. since when did retailer exclusively market to older women? no, retailer's market has always been young adults. this dress is extremely matronly. although the bottom print is nice, the hot pink belt?? is completely mismatched and gaudy. i really hope retailer starts curating better dress
3 Yummy, soft material, but very faded looking. so much so that i am sending it back. if a faded look is something you like, then this is for you.
3 So, so cute. totally flattering. but the seams don't lie flat and there are loose threads all over the place. i've had issues with quality from retailer for a while (random holes in things) and was disappointed this fit that bill. i'm keeping it anyway because it's so cute!
3 I bought this dress in a regular xs. i am 5'3" and 108 pounds. i have a long torso so the regular would fit better than the petite. although the overall fit of the dress was good, the straps could have had about an inch taken out and the pockets gaped open! in the photo, the mode's arms are laying over where the pockets would be, which fall on the seam and when i tried this on, the dress fit beautifully but the pockets gape open on the sides and it looks like little wings from the front. the dre
3 Overall, the dress is beautiful, easy, and great quality. but the bottom part has more fabric than it appears in the photo, if that makes sense. it's not poofy or super-layered, but i had to pinch fabric on a part of the dress in order for it to have that more straight/shift shape that you see online here. besides that bottom part, the fit is true to size. but as a petit, the extra fabric isn't what i'm looking for.i think it works depending on what you're looking for. beautiful though!
3 This coat is absolutely beautiful - an instant stunner. the style is very classy and timeless. it is definitely more of a lightweight coat than true cold weather wear. yes, it does run large, but that is the cozy look of it. it is not meant to be form-fitting. my one gripe is that - especially at the price point - if it's not going to be especially warm, it should at least be otherwise functional. the coat i received has pockets cut on the outside, but they are sewn shut. a coat without pockets?
3 I still have mixed feelings about this pants. the fabric is nice, soft and flows well. the fit is good, i ordered 30, could have gone with 29, not a big deal. the one thing that is off is the length - i am 5.7 and these come right to above my ankle...nowhere close to how they sit on the model. the issue with this length is that is neither here nor there, too short for regular pant length and too long for crops. i will probably have to hem them a bit, which is a disappointment when you pay so muc
3 This dress has very pretty colors on the embroidery, there is nothing wrong with the dress, other than the fact that there is nothing special about it. very blah fit. the fabric feels very polyester. no real shape to it. the embroidery on the dress i tried was lined up like the photo, so no problems there, just nothing about the dress made me want to wear it. perhaps at a much lower price point, but at this price point, its disappointing. size 2 fit perfectly, and i am 5'2" 112. in general, just
3 I really wanted to love this romper and couldn't wait to try it on.   it's super cute and love the material but once on the top portion is way too baggy even after cinching the waist.   if i pulled the waist all the way down it looks smoother and nice,  but if it sits at my natural waist,  the back balloons out and it's unflattering.  it's too bad,  i love the print and ease of this design.
3 I wanted to love this dress so badly. it came and the material is beautiful, but when i put it on it fit so awkwardly. there was just no way to make it look good. maybe i needed a smaller size, but oh well.
1 This looked like a simple, chic blouse, but the fabric felt cheap to me, like thin lining fabric. the neckline is too deep and wide as well and so not flattering.
3 I loved this at first....but the quality is awful! it pilled like crazy and started to get little holes near the neck after 4-5 wears. second sweater from retailer this year with severe pilling issues. i love retailer, but will never again buy another sweater here.
1 This dress didn't work for me at all. i'm 6ft tall, 160lb, i usually wear size l 8/10, but based on the reviews i ordered an m. the material of this dress is very soft and fuzzy, color is about the same as pictured, also length is appropriate. dress is very thick and warm, the fabric however has no stretch at all, dress is very specious and shapeless. there is allot of room everywhere except shoulders & sleeves, i thought that area was tight & snug which is strange because it runs large everywhe
3 This dress is so cute and so flattering. i loved the shape, but i wore it wonce and the fabric was pulling on everything! just holding a purse while walking managed to pull out a ton of the fabric! when you spend so much money on something you think the quality would be better..
1 Contrary to the first review, there is a zipper so while it wasn't easy to get on, it did fit over my bust. i found this too small and high waisted, and i already have a high waist so i can imagine it looking empire waisted on a normal torso. what i hated was the ridiculous inverted pleat in the front of the dress which is almost impossible to see in the online photo. it made my already busty frame even wider and more unflattering. the lining was nice and soft and the sleeve length and hemline l
3 This is a nice dress made with high quality fabric. unfortunately i'll need to make a return as it was quite big. i bought this dress in an xs and it was too large all around. i am about 5'3" and 112 lbs and would have taken the petite, but there were none available. i'm not sure the petite would have even been small enough. the dress was a bit too long for short ladies and definitely too large in the waist and the bust (i'm small on top). it's too bad a this was a cute, and versatile dress that
3 At 5'5" (almost), 122lbs., i always wear a size small. however this dress runs large (no, i am not smaller than i was 6 months ago) and it looked like a dumpy sack on me. too bad, i really wanted it to fit! it is a slightly heavier fabric than anticipated, and would be an excellent travel dress. i may try the xs. . .
3 I've been looking at this jacket on line and finally went to the store to try it on. i really liked the styling but the denim was quite stiff. i'd prefer a softer kind of fabric. i wonder if it would soften if it was washed. also, it ran surprisingly small. i usually take an xsmall or small but the small didn't leave me enough room to comfortably bend my arms. the medium worked better. i wonder how others feel about the fabric and and the sizing. i think i'll wait and see if this one goes on sal
3 This sweater is thicker and darker than it appears online. i thought it would be more of a blush color, but it's more dark gray and brown. it wasn't that flattering on me as a cardigan. looked a little cuter all buttoned up, but ultimately i am not keeping because of the color.
1 The shirt is beautiful, but fits much too small. the stitching limits the space in your shoulders, and the hem too short. a petite frame would be able to pull this off- but i am a 5.10" medium, and the shirt didn't work in every direction.
3 Material and color is nice.  the leg opening is very large.  i am 5'1 (100#) and the length hits me right above my ankle.  with a leg opening the size of my waist and hem line above my ankle, and front pleats to make me fluffy, i think you can imagine that it is not a flattering look.  if you are at least average height or taller, this may look good on you.
3 I thought this dress looked really cute and many people gave it great reviews. for me, there were a few key things off for it to work. i thought the material was soft, although not thick as you might expect with a turtleneck style dress. i ordered a small and the top fit ok, the arms were a little tight. then the larger problem was the body, it hides everything which is great but the way it fell and just sort of hung there, it didn't do anything for my figure and was not flattering around the wa
1 I wish i had read the other reviews before purchasing this product. label says that you can wash and dry normally. however, upon washing, the outer layer shrunk and the inner lining did not. the robe will now not lay flat; the fabric pulls at the edges, and results in the inner lining being revealed when the robe is tied shut. extremely disappointed. for a $100 garment, i expected much more. i wish i could return this.
3 The top is really cute, but it's see through and the material doesn't seem like the highest quality. definitely not worth the price.
3 1. the wide leg/crop is a cool trend. but not great on me. i'm pretty standard in size/build: 5'6", 135 lbs,, size 4. i felt like i just looked oddly shaped with them on.2. and maybe this is the issue: the size 27 (my normal size in every citizen pant i own) was about 2 whole sizes too big for me. i mean, i felt great about myself. but...wowza.3. when i took them to the store to try on/exchange, they don't even carry them in the store! so i just returned and will try something else.
3 I really wanted to love this dress, but it just wasn't flattering on me. i have curves and i was hoping this would hug them in a joan on mad men way (sometimes these dresses that just hang on super thin models can look beautiful in a different way on a more voluptuous woman) but it was pretty shapeless on me. it also dips so low in the back that i would have to get a special bra to wear it. might be right for a more slender shape or someone who can go braless, but it didn't work for this short,
3 I really like the look of these socks, and have become obsessed we over-the-knee socks for winter this year. they are very tick which is nice for keeping warm and for durability for a long lasting product. my only complaint is that they are very difficult to get over the knee. this can be a great thing, because they certainly do stay put-which is a huge problem with over-the-knee socks. however, by the end of the day i was pretty sure i was going to lose a leg from poor circulation.i am still
3 I ordered this in the orange color from online. they were sold out of petite so i ordered medium (regular). i liked it, but just not flattering. i am 5'2" and the coat was too big. sleeves were past my hands. i think because i'm "curvy" the straight cut of coat would not have looked good on me in a size small. it was a nice coat, just not for me.
3 Couldn't wait for this sweater to arrive. i love oversized sweaters for the fall! unfortunately this sweater is extremely itchy that it has to be returned :(
3 This dress is adorable and well made. this brand runs on the large side. i ordered an xs and the tag says 'p" on it. it's not petite. it ran large through the hips and will need alteration. i'm keeping it because it is really cute and is well made. the material is knit and soft - very comfortable. i'm surprised nobody has reviewed this item. i probably will not buy this brand again only because it runs large.
3 I am on the fence about this dress. the fabric is gorgeous and soft. however, i was hoping the fit was more slouchy like pictures on the model. it was much shorter on me that pictured (for reference i am 5'7) and the turtle neck part of the dress is kind of high and tight. i wanted to love this so much, but it is a touch off from what i was hoping it was going to be.
3 Loved this dress and ordered it based on glowing reviews. ordered size large because i weigh 155 pounds and have a large 34g bust. the dress skimmed nicely over my body but the baby doll style fit loosely and made me look really wide from the side. i probably could have sized down for a better fit, but it might have just emphasized my bust. the fabric has a substantial weight and it's lined. best as a fall, winter dress. the embroidery is beautiful. i disliked the intense black color around my f
3 The fabric is very thin. it isn't see through, just thin. i would have kept this if the full length shell wasn't longer than the dress.
3 I get that it's a swing style top and supposed to be loose but it looked so much bigger on me than on the model and just not flattering at all.
3 Cute little dress fits tts. it is a little high waisted. good length for my 5'9 height. i like the dress, i'm just not in love with it. i dont think it looks or feels cheap. it appears just as pictured.
3 The lace on this top is pretty, and i liked the way it was styled in the product photos, but did nothing for me on. between the loose sleeves and the boxy cut of the front, it just sort of hung shapelessly on me. i also found the back to be much shorter than 30.5"--it came to a few inches below my hips and was not tunic length like i expected. the shoulders fit me well, and because the top was boxy already, i didn't want to size up for length. for reference i tried on xs (i'm 5'4", 120 lbs).
3 I ordered this online in the cream color and because some of the reviews mentioned the shorter back, i went with a medium, but that ended up running too big. i typically wear between a 4 and a 6 / small and medium so i'm always on the fence about which size to get. i often order both online and return the one that doesn't fit as well, so i wish i had this time too! the detail on the front is super cute and i didn't even mind the plainer back, but the sleeves went well past my wrist and i felt li
3 I wanted to give this a glowing review but i ended up returning this cardigen. the folds on top added too much to my frame. i do not suggest this for heavier apple shapes. for all others, it is incredibly soft and warm. the tan color was weird but they others are simply gorgeous.
3 I really thought i would love this dress the style is really nice and the material is great. however, the length made me feel like i looked short and kind of stumpy. i feel like this dress would look really good on somebody that is more like 6ft, not my 5'6" self.
3 Probably should have returned this but it's just so pretty. i got complements from strangers the very first time i wore it but it's extremely long. tucking it in will be tough-where do you put all that length? aside from that it is beautiful. the embroidery is soft and delicate light blues, gold, neutrals. hard to see in the pic but there are textured polka dots all over the shirt. great buy-i just wonder how i'll wear it or if the length will be too much and it will become a 'closet sitter'.
1 This is the worst shirt i have ever tried on from retailer. it is basically a big shaggy box from the front, and from the side it looks like a tent. it is also short.
1 This is adorable but if it truly has to be dry-cleaned that is deal killer
3 This just wouldn't lay right on me. the top is really too big. maybe if you're really busty, this is great, but not for me. i know the top is supposed to be a bit blousy, but it was huge and droopy and unflattering (not like in the picture). the arm holes were too big and hung down so you could see my bra, which i really hate and which is way too common lately. the bottom half fit perfectly, so sizing up or down would not have helped. the material is super light and comfy, which i liked very muc
3 This was really billowy but not in a good way. i had to return it. looks great in the photo but not so much in person.
1 I couldn't wait to get this top in the mail since they didn't have it at my local retailer, but i was so disappointed in both the quality and fit. the white is completely see-thru, i can't believe how sheer the material is - especially for the price. even as the shirt is lying down, i can see through both layers of it... the fit runs small, and short.
3 Very pretty dress. the color is much brighter in person - a little too bubblegum pink for me. i love the way the bodice fit but there was just too much material in the skirt which made me look hippier than i am. would have preferred the skirt to have more of an a-line cut
3 Loved the fabric and details. the cut was a tad looser/bigger than i expected.perfect dress for fall.
3 I loved the way this top looked in stock photos. the colors are bright and cheery and it's a great transition piece. but the way the sleeves are cut almost makes them feel like water wings (if that makes sense)? they are stiff and wide and awkward. i've worn this a few times, hoping maybe the sleeves would relax down. they haven't. maybe it will look okay under a blazer for the office or something.
3 Note: if you have a large chest, the seams hit in an unflattering spot. nice shirt, just not great for the price.
3 I'm 5'2 and 105 lbs; normally a size 25 petite for most jean brands but learned after receiving my online purchase that these jeans run large. i exchanged them for a size 24 petite and thought they fit okay at first but after testing them around the house, they kept stretching and i felt like they were going to fall off my waist! didn't want to wear a belt with these because it distracted from the relaxed style. sadly had to return my purchase.
3 This item states you should wash in cold water and tumble dry low heat. it shrunk after first wash in cold water and i didn&#39;t even use the dryer. do not wash. real bummer..
3 I was looking forward to receiving this dress. i am tired of all of the swing dresses - most of which are not flattering on my petite frame. i am also uncomfortable with dresses that fall much above the knee as i am somewhat older. the colors and fabric of this dress are beautiful. vibrant, but not too bright. when i got it on i was thrilled with the fit - until i looked at the back. there are pleats at the waist in back and there is way too much fabric. it looked like i had a bustle under the d
3 I liked the concept of this vest, but when i tried it on, i felt like i was 9 years old again and wearing my brownies girl scout uniform. it was also very boxy and wide. it seemed to be well-made, though, and maybe would have worked if it were a different color.
3 This romper is cute. i won't deny that. however, the rayon fabric made me really feel like i was wearing pajamas. i was afraid it would wrinkle horribly. however, the real problem with this romper is how hard it is to get on and off your shoulders. i'm short, but have a little wider shoulders, so, perhaps that was the issue. it seems like another reviewer had the same problem. there are only two snaps from the waist up and nothing to open it further from the waist down, so, i had to do some cont
3 I wanted to love this top. i really did. the color is beautiful, the embroidery is well done, the fabric is soft, and it feels like it would be very comfortable in the summer heat. but the armholes are big and so the holes show my bra which is not good. i guess i could wear a bandeau or tank underneath, but the armholes just kind of ruined my love for this top. i think i will try again and order next size down.
3 The concept of this top is edgy for a sweatshirt fabric. i think it works better on a thin frame instead of my curvy frame. although i appreciate the design, it did not work for me.
3 The smallest size, xs, was big on me, i was overwhelmed by the sweater. it is a bit of swing shape, doesn't hug the body. sleeves are interesting though, but not flattering on a petite frame. color is a pretty green, made me think of wintergreens. fabric may be itchy to some. just ok for me.for reference xs bog on 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist.
3 I was so excited to receive this shirt and so disappointed when i tried it on. it's a lot fuller than it looks in this picture or maybe it's because i ordered a large? i'm 5'8", 180lbs, 36d bra size and can fit into a large at retailer just fine but it made me look huge! not flattering at all and it was so full that it looked like a short dress!
3 I ordered the yellow color way expecting it to be a mustard color. it seemed to have a greenish tint to it and didn't look right on me. also the pockets didn't lay right so the flower didn't look right.
1 I should have read the reviews first before ordering this top/!. ***buyers beware**: you will not get the same top delivered to you, as is shown in this picture. the top i got delivered does not have the little straps at all, and while there is a bow in the back, the back sides do not come together the same to form the bow. i hate to write a bad review, but come on retailer! i'd never expect this from you. it looks like any other peplum white top, not something special like the picture is o
3 Skirt was too big in the wiast and too much fabric. was not flattering, and generally not cute enough to warrent spending 50$ to get it tailored. usual size, oop felt atleast 2 sizes too large. the pattern on the skirt, and the nuetral color is very nice. if you can find one that fits, would be a nice 3 season skirt!
3 I had been eyeing this top for weeks. it's look so beautiful on the model, however, not great on me. material is fab. the tee is way shorter than it appears online and there is too much flutter material.
3 I love how different this dress is in terms of the design. it catches light beautifully. the short, biased hem makes the dress fun and flirty. but, this dress is completely sheer. there is no lining which is very disappointing. i do have a short, nude slip that makes this dress work for me. you will need a slip, for sure! unless you are rhianna. the sizing runs a little large, i probably could size down given the loose cut but overall the proportions are flattering showing off my legs. i will re
3 Cute dress to throw on and go. fits pretty true to size except for the slip underneath. it's a little tight and i felt to short for the dress. i ended up wearing a full slip i had under it and that work great!
3 The design of this dress is darling and so unique, and it's very well made. but i agree it's very boxy and overwhelming for a petite frame. i'm 5'3" and ordered the 2, and it was like wearing a hospital gown. if a petite were available i'd have tried that, but this one's going back. shame, too, because it's adorable. the gap in the neckline could easily be stitched or sewn shut, but that's an inconvenience when this dress is already priced so high.
3 Bought it on sale and i am keeping it. it is well made an the material seems to be of good quality. however, i believe this would be more flattering on someone less curvy - less hips, smaller bust - as it makes me look slightly pregnant. still, i am keeping it to use on those days i just don't feel like dressing up for work. i bought a large (i'm a 36-38c), but i think i could've gotten away with a medium.
3 I bought the cream version online, as the blue was sold out. i was rather disappointed to see that the cream is just a glorified sweatshirt. there are no dots, it it just the heathered cream of any normal sweatshirt. i do, however, like the design and the fit of the sweatshirt. i am sad that is was not clear (in the photos or in the name) that the cream version was not dotted. i am still deciding if i will keep the shirt. i love the design and fit, but the plain boring sweatshirt was not what i
3 I adored this suit - the style, the colors, the thick quality of the fabric...but unfortunately the bottom seams cut into my groin and backside so much, it was practically painful! i'm 5'7', 128 lbs, and usually wear a size small, but was advised to size up. even with the medium i tried on, everything fit well but the length, though i've never thought i had a long torso. sizing up to a large would make the bust way to large for my small b chest. was so sad to return this suit!
3 I agree with the other reviewers; this sweater was strangly shaped in the waist, in an unflattering way. the rest of it was beautiful though. looks too much like maternity, even in a petite xs, so it's going back.
3 I really wanted to love this suit, but it honestly looked really matronly in person.
1 This reminded me of big bird in person and just adds volume to your body. i'm thin and usually wear a size 0, so i'm not sure who this may look good on.
3 I really liked this cardigan when i saw it today. the cut and detail in the back is slimming and very flattering. i love the idea of the safety pin closure, and i really like how the model wears it in this photo-open with the pin on the side. when i saw this in-store, it was closed in the front with the pin, which i also like. i thought for sure the cardigan was also pinned in back when i saw it in the model, so it looked fantastic. however, when i tried it on myself, it wasn't quite the same.
3 Embroidered tulips look like they were plucked when comparing the dresses in the product photos. took a chance any way, came out disappointed because i couldn't zip up the bodice. i hate side zips and when you pair a cheap zipper with delicate material, recipe for disaster! i am top and back heavy so though i lost weight and went down a cup size, my back is too wide for the 12p. for reference i'm 135# 36d 38/28/35.
3 I  absolutely fell in love with the stress when i sought in the store. the fabric and drape of the fabric is amazing! however, it runs extremely small. i normally wear a medium and can sometimes even wear a small and dresses. i tried on the medium and the large and i could not even get them zipped all the way.  i'm so disappointed, as this is a gorgeous dress.  definitely size up at least one, maybe two sizes.
3 I agree with the other two reviews. it is so disappointing that this adorable dress isn't lined. the fabric is paper thin! this is an a-line style dress with pockets that need to be ironed down to prevent it making you look hippy. i sized down to a petite xs. i normally buy the petite smalls but they were out of it. i would say that this dress runs a little on the large size.
3 I love the back detail but doesn't feel that comfortable on. i bought in green. it's fitted so get size larger if you plan to layer up. i'm 107 and bought xs size. i should have ordered the s.
3 This top is beautiful to look at but did not fit me like the model. it was tight across the bust but very poofy at the bottom, which normally i like, but not this time. sad.
3 Usually can just buy tiny shirts knowing that they will fit me!  and this one is beautiful but if you have any type of chest it will not work.  i'm a 34d and itwas way too small in the chest area.  it is a beautiful shirt though and i'm very sad that i have to return it.  it will work better on someone else for sure.  so i recommend this beautiful shirt for someone with a different body type from mine!
3 I liked it online, but i didn't want to pay shipping for something i wasn't sure if it is good. when i saw one size 4 in the store, i was excited to try it on. however, it didn't quite meet the expectation. the dress fits a little loose (donna morgan size 2 fits me better), and it is not lined at all. the separate top piece is just way too big without any shape. there must be a clip on the back of the top shown on the model to make it look smaller. i love the blue floral print, but that is the o
1 I was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for spring/summer. for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses. the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all. the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown. this dress has no shape to it, although probably comfortable, not flattering. i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture, in person.
3 For reference: 5'3, 130#, athletic/muscular body type (broad shoulders, slim hips)i ordered the small and i was absolutely swimming in it. perhaps the petite would have been better, but there was just too much fabric everywhere. the sleeves were ridiculous on me, and even cinching the waist with a belt just wouldn't have slimmed the silhouette for me. i have muscular shoulders, and 34d chest, so the top fit as it should, just everything became way too much elsewhere. the fabric was soft and sw
1 I was very excited to receive this dress because of the cute photo. however, upon arrival i was completely disappointed. the color is much more drab than the photo. the smudged polkadots weren't attractive. there were many little bumps and pulls in the linen. the dress is super heavy. the pleats around the waist did not lay correctly.and it adds 10 pounds to your hips! super sad! i am sending it back.
1 Yikes. there is a whole lot of skirt here. i am 5"4, weigh around 120 lb, and usually wear anywhere between a four and six in retailer clothing, depending on the designer. this skirt balloons out from the waist. on the website it seems to flow more naturally from the waist. i think that the flowers are cute but the material is cheap looking. the skirt is very long- hitting way below mid-calf. there is also tons of material - creating a parachute effect. definitely returning.
3 I love these pants but be care when you do laundry. the dye transferred to another pair of pilcro chinos that was a little lighter color. very frustrating. label mentioned it but i only noticed after it happened because the colors are both not that dark at all.
3 I ordered online and wear xs- m. i ordered a small but it seems big. i have to drive 1+ hour to a store so i do a lot of online ordering. i'm thinking of returning for smaller size. may make a road trip- have several items to return! i hate paying shipping to buy and shipping to return if it doesn't work!
3 I loved this sweater when i bought it. wore it a couple times then washed it according to the tag. it shrunk at least two sizes! and the tassels got all tangled (which i guess i should have seen coming). pretty bummed about it because this sweater looked beautiful on.
3 I loved the concept of the dress and that is why i chose to keep it in spite of the negatives. the grey color is drab, yet leaves room for creativity. it's stylish yet wrinkles horribly. i am 5' 2" so it hangs too low in the front and armpits. another reviewer mentioned the buttons, yet there should be one more to bring it up in the chest. the pockets are a great space for hands, yet fabric is too thin and they are side slits, so will not hold much. i typically wear a 4 petite and the small fits
3 I loved this shirt online and ordered it in blue immediately even though i usually hesitate to spend over $100 on casual blouses. unfortunately, i was super disappointed when it arrived. the lace does not contrast as much as shown in these pictures and it just doesn't look all that special. having said that, it is super comfy and soft and the sizing is generous - it may run big on you if you have a small chest. all in all, i would buy it on sale but certainly not worth the price tag!
3 Glad i got this on sale. it is more yellow than the photo & short. it is also heavy with a sueded interior. would have given more stars if it was less boxy & longer.
3 If you look closely at the pictures this dress is shown 2 different ways. one with a lace covered v-neck and one with a rounded neck. which is it retailer? don't know about the size but i had to answer the question. i won't order the dress until i know exactly which style i'm ordering.
3 This dress has a nice flow and it is simple but versatile. you can pair it with a jacket or cardigan for the winter and use it year round. however it runs one size large.
3 Love the warm fuzzies of this sweater, did not love the unflattering cut. the sweater hung lifelessly from my bust line down. plus, it was a little short in the front. i have to send it back. :(
1 I love the teal color of this t-shirt and the macrame design at the top is beautiful, however, the top is way too large.  i usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops, so i ordered the size s, there is so much fabric below the chest it fits like a maternity top.  i know if i order an xs, i will have the same problem.  below the bust, the top is not flattering and it&amp;#39;s a shame.
3 I absolutely love the look of this shirt with the built in layering piece. the overall garment is lightweight and not too heavy even with the added layer. however; this runs really large. in general, this brand runs large for me and i would say that if you are used to this brand, you can stick with your normal sizing for this brand. however; compared to other brands it runs very large. i think it would work fantastic for me in a different size. it is not at all fitting so it would be more like a
3 I am so bummed. these jeans are the perfect weight, totally distressed (and torn) in a way that looks like you've owned them for years, they flare out at the bottom of the legs just the right amount...but there is one huge - or i should write small - problem: your thighs have to be incredibly small to get these pulled all the way on. ----------i am a 27 in level 99 and ag brand jeans, and a 28 in my other pairs of coh jeans and in mih jeans as well. i do not have an hourglass figure (my shou
1 I really liked this shirt the one time i got to wear it...but when i washed it, according to the directions on the tag, it shrunk! a lot! the sleeves are now too tight, and it is much shorter. thinking about returning it to the store, but in any case, i cannot wear it again.
3 I love the feel and quality of these pants, however, they ran super big! they would not stay up around my waist, unfortunately.
3 Disappointed with the fit and color of this sweater. more of a rusty red then bright cherry red. i ordered a small and found the sweater had no shape and just hung lumpy on me. i am 5'5 120 and usually a small in retailer sweaters.
3 This dress is very pretty colorwise, but the fit did not work for me. i could see this working on girls with narrow hips, but it didn't flatter my narrow waist/wide hip frame.
3 Absolutely stinning dress! statement piece for sure however i will agree with other reviews that the bust is small and has no give or wiggle room with the side zipper...one if those dreaded side zippers that you always fear breaking as you dress. sizing up would help but the waist then appears too big or bulky.. i am on the fence about whether or not it's a keeper ...definitely perfect for the smaller chested. i usually wear xs size 2/4 the 6 zipped the 4 nearly did but would've smashed. neverth
3 I like everything about this shirt except i wish the embroidery was on the back too. gives it a cheaper look by only having it on the front. you will look prettier coming than going for sure!
3 I like design of the dress, softness and color ( i got grey), the dress is shorter on me then on model ( 5'6" 145 lbs) i got m fits ok but i don't like fabric quality it seems like it can be peeled and picks up everything and needs to be sprayed all the time. despite i got it with 40% discount it will come back as it's poor quality.
1 I was so excited to try these, it's hard to find cute bermuda shorts. the legs were so wide. my husband asked if i was wearing his shorts. they don't look that wide in the picture. i am 5'4" and 130 lbs i bought my regular size 28 but the waist was huge i could have sized down one or two sizes. unrolled they came to my knee.
1 On a hot summer 90 degree day the blue ink on the dress stained the dress and my new tory burch bag. i would never have expected that the blue print would bleed all over me and my new dress. great dress and such a wonderful fit...too bad its unwearable now.
3 I think this blouse would work for petites. it is super short and boxy. looked nothing like the fit on the model. sad to return it, love the print.
3 This style of shirtdress usually fits me perfectly, however, this did not fit me one bit. the waist was too large, the length too short, and the hips too small. i was really hoping this would fit, since it's a unique color and the material is substantial but soft. i will be returning this.
3 I ordered this and there is just so much fabric! in the pictures i think it is pinned in the back, in the main photo, to make it look more streamlined. definitely a miss!
3 This lift weight cardigan is true to size, perfect for fall or spring. colors are quite nice, especially the little pops of orange.
3 I love these overalls  but they run very small?i had to return and reorder.
3 This top is very pretty, but it fits funny. it's boxy and doesn't hang well. i feel like you could almost wear it as a 2nd-trimester-pregnancy-blouse. i tried the small & the small petite. they both fit the same (too big and too boxy), but the petite was shorter. i am 5'2", 125lbs, 34b. i preferred the regular length, but if you like your tops to end at your waistband, then the petite would fit too. i still really like the top, so i may try it in a smaller size when it goes on sale.
3 This is a beautiful coat nicely constructed and very warm. it was just too bulky for me and i looked 10 lbs heavier in it. i am 5'7" and 140 lbs. maybe it would be better suited to a more slender frame.
3 So sad!  this beautiful dress which i have been waiting to receive didn't work for me.  i'm a 5'7" hourglass girl and it just made me look big!  but i love the pattern and the way it looks on the photo online!  so sad but will return it!0
1 I wish i had read all the reviews before purchasing. the sweater looked liked everything i would be interested in online. once i pulled it out of the bag, my first thought was how could retailer send me a used, washed and shrunken sweater. it is nothing like the picture. it fits like a midriff top, not exaggerating. i'm 5.6, ordered the m, don't waste your shipping money on this.
3 First, i love wool. if it's 100% wool, i love it. if wool isn't your thing, then this dress isn't for you. i ordered this dress online in the burgundy. it is not itchy. it falls above my knees and i am 5'3". it is warm and cozy with pockets, which i love. with the sleeves being short, i am wearing a long, frilly cardigan over it. i ordered the small (did not notice a size chart with this product). i am usually a size 4 or 6. it fits great in the bodice, but runs large through the hips. however,
3 It seems like most people love this tee, so you might as well. i returned it because i didn't like how the front hung. if the front was as long as the back, i would have kept it. or, if the front was short enough to wear with thick pants, untucked, i might have kept it (seems like this top would only look good with leggings or skirts). i do like the material, though. it's very thin and looks great in the shoulder and neck area. and i liked how the back of the shirt looked when i tried wearing it
3 The stylist had me try this top on off the shoulders, but that was kind of snug, perhaps why it didn't fit right, it is not off the shoulders on this picture. the cut is loose, so it looked big on me, but going smaller would not have worked the way i had it on... may give it another try on. xs was big, so would need to try the xxs next time. but off the shoulders looked nice on the lady who was smaller built next to me!colors are nice, light, but appropriate for fall (or summer!) light fabri
3 Love the design and style of this dress when i saw it online, however, it falls a little short once in person. it was a bit boxier than i wanted and the lines didn't make it appear as a swing dress, highlighting your figure.i wish this could have worked, however, it felt a little too unshapely.
3 Ordered this online in the pinkish color. the material is a little thin. as a busty, curvy lady this one just didn't sit right, ran a tad large, and looked boxy. if you have a thinner frame, may be a better look for you. detailing is nice.
3 I was under the impression that the blouse is lined however i'd need to buy yet another tank to go underneath which may be an issue due to how short this blouse is. i returned it.
3 This was very tight in the bust in my typical size. it fit more or less everywhere else, but the material has no give. so unless you are the precise measurements of the dress, this will be a hard dress to wear.the color is really lovely though!
3 This is an oversized tee with a somewhat flattering fit. material is very thin. i ordered white, which was completely see-through. not at all what i was expecting. might work better in a darker color, but i returned it since it was nothing special.
3 I saw this dress online and immediately fell in love with the bow design. purchased my typical size 4 but found it way too tight. i went to my local retailer to exchange it for the size 6. unfortunately, even the size 6 just did not fit right. moving around in the dress was challenging; the slightest shoulder/arm movement made the dress ride up. i was constantly pulling it down. the fabric is also quite stiff and heavy. overall, it's a cute dress but just not for me.
3 Well, this top just did not do anything for me - it's a very conservative style with the high neckline and blousy fit. you'd need to go a little lower in size if you want any of your figure to show through. i guess it might be good for a church function or some other conservative event, but it was too buttoned-up for my style. i also had a hard time getting it off even though the size i tried on was large for me. i didn't care for the feel of the fabric either, although the lace is nice.
3 The fabric was more "southwestern" looking when i got it than it looked in the pics. it fit a bit larger around the bottom than i like.
1 This dress is not flattering. the slip is very small and short and the dress is big and billowy. like the other reviewer said, its more like a tablecloth that you stick your head through. it was really hard to figure out how to cinch in the waist but it didn't help regardless. the length is not accurate either. i would say it's a pretty short dress (mid thigh) but that probably depends on the person. it also makes you look very horizontal. i was really excited about this dress but it's getting r
1 The fit was not flattering at all, but the worst part was the colors were really dull and not bright as shown in the online photos.
3 I so wanted to love this dress! the fabric is gorgeous the styling beautiful and the construction is great - however, the armholes are cut too generously. i am 5'4", 138 pounds and 36d. i ordered the black in a size 10. it fit me perfectly everywhere but the armholes. even with an undergarment, too much is exposed. i am sadly returning this.
3 This top is adorable in style and fit. which is why it breaks my heart that i can't recommend it. the embroidery snags so easily, when i wore it, i ended up with several tears in the threads, leaving the pattern a bit of a mess. it snagged on my rings, my watch and my purse. i returned it because of this. it's really too bad, and i wish the design were printed on instead of sewn, simply because it would last a lot longer.
3 I really wanted to keep this dress, and the material is amazing, so soft and gentle and delicate, the design is great, the front looks nice, but from back looks really awkward, big and kind of too loose!
3 This is one of those dresses that might be better for those under 40. on me, the fullness of the pleats and the bell sleeve made me feel like i was wearing one of those dresses for a much older lady. i miss not having to consider those things. the red color is lovely and the dress is modest. i just think it will read a lot better on a younger chiquita.
3 I found both colors and jumped on this shirt. then i got it home and realized that it was pretty much useless. there is no way to put a sweater or jacket over it, it is too hot to wear in the summer, putting a tee under ruins the look.i am very flat chested so it hung well, but there is lots of shirt. both went back in exchange for two wearable items.
3 The styling of this top is really cute. it fits perfectly on the shoulders and gets bigger at the hem for the baby doll look. my biggest complaint is the quality! it's really cheap and feels like the quality i would expect to see at a cheap retailer. it catches lint like crazy and because the hem is just a pearl edge, it curls really badly. i buy quite a bit from here and this is the worst quality item i have seen in a long time. not worth the $$ if paying full price.
3 If you have any curves at all then this will look like a sack on you. i wanted to love it because of the material and i've been looking for a blazer/ jacket that was heavy in weight. this just looked awful on me. maybe for someone who is very slender this will work but i was highly disappointed in the cut.
3 Loved the shorts version of these so ordered the pants but not quite the right fit for my legs. no fault of the pants just too skinny in the legs.
3 This shirt is tough for me because i loved the front, which fit nicely, but i'm petite and the back had a giant extra piece of fabric that bumped out because of the cross straps, i wish it wasn't so wide so i could have bought it!
3 Not sure why this dress was once backordered? if you have a big chested basically falls from your chest straight down and gives you know figure. disappointing. i will be returning it. not meant for big chested fit woman.
3 Lightweight, airy silk. it's not shown in the photos but it has a half slip which is too noticeable through the thin silk. it looks somewhat cheap. the silk doesn't feel smooth to the touch. it has a slight roughness to it. it would have been nicer if they had used thicker, higher quality silk. the waist has a tight, wide, elastic band which after wearing for awhile feels uncomfortable. the color of the skirt is true to the photos. i wanted to love this skirt but i will be returning it.
3 Lovely palette and and fabric but the cut did not flatter my shape. the flowy cut broadened my silhouette and hit at my waist making me look bigger than i actually am. the overall effect was quite frumpy in spite of the flamboyant pattern. perhaps a better choice for someone built exactly like the model.i will be returning it.
3 I love belted sweaters, but this was way too low in front. it hung almost to my knees in front. i'm not a fan of that look.
3 I wanted to love this, as it seemed like a fun and carefree take on a little black dress.but how did i not see that this has tassels? but they're there, a whole row of them - look hear the bottom of the skirt part, between the colorful stripes and the lacy area. that's a deal breaker for me - i really can't stand the way these look, and they're not the sort of thing you can easily remove.the fabric, though nice quality, has no stretch at all. i wasn't expecting stretch, but i'd just say
3 L space is frustrating. i wear a 0/2 top but with 32d's i tried a large in this bikini top because from past experience with l space they run small. there's just zero support. the tie design helps secure the girls in place, but also flattens them out if you tie it tight enough so you don't spill out.
3 I loved the color and lines of this jumpsuit, but found it to be far too short in the torso. (and about 8" too long in the leg, but that's a lot easier to fix.) i tried sizing up, but it still wasn't working for me. i'm only 5'7", and while i'm long-waisted i can usually make jumpsuits work. if you have a short torso and long legs, this is a beautiful option. otherwise, i can't recommend it.
3 This top was so pretty online! unfortunately it did not work for me- the front was a bit more shapeless in person, though the back was gorgeous, with a button gather at center. the color appeared yellow online, but was a bit more green in person. also, the armholes were very low, so it would need a camisole or no bra.
1 When i tried these on in the store i was thrilled - they were comfy as yoga pants and  the fit was divine. i thought i had found the perfect jeans and i splurged on them for my birthday. after wearing just two times they are baggy and the knees are totally bagged out, saggy and faded.so disappointing - i want my $180 back!
3 I really wanted to love this dress.... i absolutely love the fabric and the bottom of it. sadly, the top was just too "balloon like" and poofed out way too much. i tried putting a belt with it which helped a little bit. if the top had been just a little more fitted this would be awesome. i don't know if a smaller size would have helped the issue... i ordered a small and considered an xs but in the end just returned it.
3 Cute shirt but no worth full price for sure. runs small in the bust. and i am not busty at all. definitely order up a size. i am returning mine, however, because of size and price.
3 Recommend this vest - nice design - fabric is thicker than expected - might suggest a size smaller - plenty of room in loose styling
3 This dress is very cute and is made well.  i bought up a size from what i usually where as one reviewer mentioned the dress is small in the bust. this is always a problem for me therefore i ordered a 14. i was surprised that the 14 was sung in the bust. and then understood why the 16 was sold out. i was 30/40 lbs heavier when i wore a 16..never would have thought i'd have to order up that high. i've been running a 10 or 12 depending on the level of my activity. i'm keeping the dress because i kn
3 I never write reviews
3 I ordered this dress before it became available in my local retailer store. i love the style of this dress but the fabric was not as expected. it is a heavy/fuzzy knit and i had envisioned something lighter and cleaner. i would love to see it in a different fabric! sadly returned it....
3 I read all reviews and i decided to try as the price was great. first of all i am 5'6" 145 lbs, athletic build (not skinny but have muscles). the sweater fits great, just like glove, it does not make me look fat. the quality is great,sweater is warm, cozy and well-made. i am not sure about color as it's brighter as it shown. it is not quite coral, it's a little bit darker which will make it difficult to match it with. the sleeves run small so if you are taller then me just keep it in mind. th sw
3 I wish it were easier to get in this dress. i'm 5'4 with a 36d and i couldn't get it on. it's so pretty though.
1 It's sheer, the design /print is casual, but on silk like material. had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it! who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer???
3 This runs very small and has a beautiful design but it feels very cheap. material feels like thinnest possible t-shirt material out there. surprised with retailer on this one. back home to retailer it goes!
3 I love the metallic colors of this top and figured i could wear it under a ruched jacket and circle skirt for work. welp, that's out the window. this design is poor. for one, this is not a piece for a petite woman with no torso and i don't know how anyone with a longer torso wears t his. this hits above my belly botton on and i got apetite 2. i have no torso. so, without a jacket, i would never wear this. it's very low cut..the back is very low..it's a little loose but i run between a 2 and a 4.
3 Construction excellent. the dress was pretty big around the hip...does not have a shape like seen in the picture. the fabric was beautiful but was stiff...like furniture. the color was not as vibrant as the picture. returned.
1 I can always count on retailer to sell unique pieces, so when i saw this sweatshirt online, i ordered it right away.  it&#39;s adorable and quirky, however, when i received it in the mail, it reminded me of something my grandma would wear.  the sleeves are puff sleeves and are really long, while the bottom of the sweatshirt hit pretty high on my waist that when i raised my arms my stomach was showing.  if this was a more tailored sweatshirt, i would be keeping it, but sadly it&#39;s going back.
1 Very cute top. i went down a size because for me it was a little large in the back, but that was just my taste. i purchased the denim print.
1 I had to return this blouse because it ended up been too small and super itchy. im kind of busty but medium usually works and this one was super tight across my chest. not comfortable at all and the fabric is kind of a sheer with the sparkly lines in silver.wouldn't recommend it.
3 Just didn't look as cute on me as the pics online. the color blocking was kind of odd actually. returning.
3 Beautiful detail and soft sweater. i ordered a medium and the toro so fit well but was short. arms were long and baggy in comparison. given the fit, i didn't think the small would work. really wanted this to work but unfortunately it is going back.
3 I'm not much for ponchos, but this one looked unique. it is thin, kind of a felt material - that was expected - but i was surprised to find it was shorter at waist than how it appears online,, and it was wide horizontally. the colors were more muted and the design was slightly off center unlike pic. the turtleneck was thick and itchy. it was a return.
3 I so wanted to keep this sweater but the invisible metallic threads that give the sweater its crinkled appearance are super scratchy and irritating. it definitely requires a long sleeved top to prevent the irritation as shown in the online photo. it is lightweight and i planned to wear it over sleeveless summer tops/dresses. i have averaged size arms and there was plenty of upper arm room. in fact extra room is designed into the sleeves. one plus for those with upper arm fit concerns. the lower
3 I saw this in that postcard "catalog" and it drew my attention immediately, so when i saw it at the store, i knew i would try it on.this dress is gorgeous - the lace is sturdy and won't easily be caught on things, the chambray is substantial but light. it's put together well and the slip covers greatly. the material isn't stretchy, but it keeps it shape and i like that. i'm 5'7" and it hit me right at the knee, so it's a good length if you wanted to wear it with a cardigan to work as a spring
3 I practically live in lounge pants, and i like the unique style of this wide-leg version. i'm generally a 6/28 in pants and ordered the small which fit well, if a bit big. the overall fit is great - slim at the hip with a nice wide waistband, and flatteringly-placed dropped pockets. the pants really slim my hips and provide a nice silhouette with the wide legs. the fabric is soft and flows and i did not experience any sheerness. as for color - i would call these a deep cool brown, definitely not
1 Although beautiful colors this eyelet dress is quite heavy and the buttons have no give- one of them literally cracked when i tried to unbutton it. unbuttoning it was difficult due to the tight weave. it just misses the mark and will be going back.
3 This is a darling little sweater. it is well made and the fit is true to size, however, it's just not long enough on me to be a top, which is what i was hoping for.  i thought it would be pretty with some high waisted trousers in a sort of 40's style but it's way to short on me for that. even with my highest waisted pants and skirts, it shows skin.  i think it can really only be worn as a shrug over a dress or something.  that explains why the model looks hunched over in some photos.  i'm still
3 I wish his dress would have worked. it is beautiful!! however, the waist and bust runs very small. the bottom of the dress does flare out a bit but the waist is so tight that unless you are a stick, everything at your waist and hips will stick out.
3 Super cute sweater and i was totally excited and then i looked at the sleeves (which are not shown in the pictures). what you can not see are the dragonfly (sequins and sparkly beads suitable for women 4 and 84). ugh. too bad - going right back.
3 Oh how i wanted this skirt to work.... the fabric - both pattern and color - is beautiful. the style is very nice. the knit is comfortable. but... the knit was so soft and pliable that it lost its shape right away. after wearing it for an hour, the front slit was curling in weird directions. the fabric around the hips got sort of crooked and hang-y. i would have loved the fabric to be one notch more substantial for a more defined waist and better integrity around the hips.
1 I wanted this so badly, to wear as a dress over a slip. but it is not cute or flattering when you put it on. it made me look 20 pounds heavier than i am, and the fit was awful. i usually wear an xs in dresses at retailer and this swallowed me. i am petite but this is just waaaaaay too big. so disappointed because it's so pretty.
3 Read all the reviews i didn't really understand that it really had real shape wear in the skirt. i live in florida and found the dress to be too confining and hot. i would never get any wear out of it. much better for someone up north. had to return it.
3 If you have muscular thighs, like me, these won't fit well. i'm usually a size 8-fitted/10-relaxed, i bought these in a large and the shins were the most relaxed part. had to return for not fitting well. but the quality of the product was nice.
3 Fits well through the shoulders and arms, but there is zero waist, and it just looks like a bunch of extra fabric hanging from the top. super cute, but have to return because of that.
3 I am so sad that this romper didn't work out. it's just way too billowy and huge. i am usually between a small and medium so i ordered this small. i'm petite and somewhat curvy and i was absolutely swimming in this romper! might look best on taller girls. i am 5 '2 and about 125-130 lbs and this was like wearing a tent. do not recommend. such a bummer because i was a believer after treading all of the great reviews!
3 I just received this beautiful dress in the mail after ordering my usual size petite 12. words can't describe how beautiful the fabric and embroidery appeared as i pulled the dress from the box. i quickly tried it on. the length was perfect. but when i attempted to zip the side zipper, i realized that i would never be able to zip it up over my size 38c chest. the bodice is simply too small. sadly, i have to return the dress. this is my biggest disappointment from retailer so far. if you have a ver
1 As the other reviewer stated the dress is not lined and the fabric feels very cheap. i tried the sp as well and felt i could have gone down to the xsp. i like the style and coloring but given the price and lack of quality this is going back.
3 I ordered this turtleneck in white and was very surprised to find that the material is so thin and gauzy it's sheer. i will definitely have to wear a white camisole under this every time i wear it, even when using it as a layering piece. it seems to run true to size if not a little small. the neck is interesting because it is so light and floppy...you can adjust several ways. it doesn't hold form well, though. i will most likely keep it but will never wear it without something both under and ove
3 There isn't much shape to this dress. it's fairly straight from top to bottom. i'm smaller on top with a small waist but slightly pear shaped. the top half was somewhat loose but the bottom half just clung too much. i'm 5'2" and 107 lbs and bought a pxs for reference. also, i wore a tee shirt underneath and the dress shed all over it.
3 I just tried on this dress in the store, in red, and i loved the off the shoulder design. the color is just as pictured online (a light poppy red). the neckline began a few inches below my collarbone and was super flattering. however, the skirt portion of this dress flared awkwardly at the hips, causing my hips to look much wider than they really are (and also disturbing the otherwise clean lines of the dress). it seemed to me that there was too much fabric at the back portion of the skirt than
3 Recently started loving rockets. i own a pair in black and a pair that are distressed. i've found that the 27s fit me best. i am 5'7", 34c, 28 waist. this particular pair seems to run true to size, meaning i could get the 28s on (which is typically what i wear in other brands), but the 27s were embarassingly too small. while the 28s fit, and are made of a great weighty denim, with very little stretch, the wash was really not appealing. due to the distressing of the wash, all the lines butterfly
3 This coat is so lovely, it is the embodiment of 1940's classic movie star style. the color, the style, the collar add a subtle flair of drama that you definitely want in your wardrobe .... if only it weren't for those pesky buttons!like other reviewers, i am disappointed to note that within a month of owning, the top button popped off in the middle of a dinner date on a rainy night in a french restaurant. that same night, i noticed a button was missing from one of the sleeves. alas, i am as yet
3 This was too big in the arms & i didn't like how there was only one button toward the top so that it made your body look hippy. little too itchy too. best thing about it was the look of the slouchy collar.
3 I got this shirt and loved it so much the first time i wore it. it swings well and is an easy basic that looks great. however, after i washed it the first time, it became clingy and stuck to me and doesn't lie right. it's such a shame because i was thrilled with this as an addition to my wardrobe!
3 Very boxy top, not flattering on. i will be returning.
3 I purchased this shirt online. i thought it would be perfect for work, but when i tried it on, i couldn't even button half the buttons. it is also extremely see-through, and even a nude or white cami underneath would look really odd. need to return, unfortunately. if the top came in other colors, i would return for a larger size, but i can't deal with see-through work tops.
1 The fit on this is so strange. the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift. the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price. the cups are padded, which is nice i suppose, but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i'm guessing. i'm a 32dd, size 8 in pants, and size 4/6 in dresses and i ordered a medium. i also have a long torso, which probably didn't help.
3 This runs a little big and falls off the shoulders a bit. i didn't like it as much as i had hoped.
3 This sweater caught my eye and the positive reviews and pre-holiday sale had me try it. loved the color and cut but surprisingly not the embroidery. i felt like i'd wear it a couple of times and then tire of it. my husband and daughter both said, "meh," so back it went.
3 Not keeping this one. the fabric is a bit tacky-looking in person, the cut is odd and it's just not me. fit is fine and there are snaps to keep the neckline flat and shaped, the colors are as shown and it is a good length (falls to top of hip). i simply did not like it. too metallic looking maybe...
3 The wine color is beautiful, and the idea of a knot front with different back is a good one. however, both fabrics are thin, and the back is quite see through. the knit shows every single bodily imperfection. so, if you are the quintessential tall and thin, and you don't mind showing your bra, go for it! otherwise, i suggest skipping this one.
3 I was hopeful my size l would fit after another pair of leggings from antrho in this order was too small. these went on easier and i was feeling good until i reached the lower abdomen and everything came to a screeching halt. i'm not sure they are too small, rather, i believe, they are styled to be low-rise. not sure why anyone would want that in a legging, but i'm new to this athletic-wear trend. regardless, i won't be wearing these!
3 I bought these for a trip to the caribbean. i sweat a lot. if you have ever been humiliated by having a ring of sweat around your crotch area, then i do not recommend these shorts in the moss color. this color and fabric do not camouflage sweat. i will spare you the photos.
3 This spandex top, in my opinion, is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive, but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is, it should fit like this. 5' 5" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but, as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.
1 After reading the reviews i sized down to a 6. once i received it, i loved the fabric and color, however it was so ill-fitting. it's like the designer didn't even use female measurements and used a box to make this top--too wide. i liked it so much that i sized way down to a 0 and it still fit horribly. it is too wide and not long enough. both are going back!
3 I love the colors in this top, but sadly i'm going to have to return it. the first thing my husband did when he saw this on me was just stare, and not in a good way. then he said it looked like a maternity top. i was so disappointed, and sadly will be returning this. for reference, i am 135 pounds. 5-ft. 4-in tall and do not want to look pregnant in a top. i normally wear size medium tops, but this one is huge. now i know why the model in the picture had her arms nestled in at her sides. this to
3 This is a truly beautiful dress, and yes, so much better in person.  upon examining the dress, however, i saw some problems.  the embroidery above the waistline was loose in places, there were some frayed ends, and even some &#39;fuzzy&#39; spots where it looked like the stitching had rubbed against something.  the dress is over $250, and for that price i expect the embroidery to be top-notch.  returning and hope the replacement is in better shape.  if so, it will be a keeper!
3 This may be lovely on some people but it didn't work on me at all. i thought it would have some swing to it but the bottom hem was tight. if i had gone up a size, the top would have been huge. the bib wasn't flattering on me and it's also quite sheer. too bad because the print is great. maybe if you're athletic with slim hips you can manage it. i think if you are busty this could look like maternity wear on you. back it went, sadly.
3 I am a huge pilcro fan. however, these were beyond large. i am not even sure that the next size down would work. keep this in mind if you attempt these pants.
3 These jeans fit perfectly. however, the distress at the knee was a bit too distressed for my taste. i would recommend these jeans for a younger demographic.
3 I wear a size 4 and i ordered the small for this top. it is huge and gave me a maternity-look that i wasn't going for. i was hoping for a loose, body-skimming fit as shown on the model in the picture but that wasn't happening with this top.
3 I'm normally between a 4-6 in retailer dresses. i had to go up to a size 10 just to get the buttons across the chest to close and lay properly without feeling like i would bust out. definitely not for those with any kind of chest.
3 I thought these would be nice, and they are but then i started thinking that the bejewels will eventually be out of style and these can't be as much of a classic... also, the jewels make the jeans feel heavier. fit is like most boyfriend/girlfriend jeans, slightly loose (not as much on me due to muscles) and length on petite was close to what is shown here (typical for me that it is still a bit longer, as not only am i short, but i have short legs for my shortness!)so if you want that styl
3 Loved the grey color and the design but the shirt ran huge. i ordered a 2 and it fit me like an extra large. i am 5'2" about 110 pounds and not flat chested.
3 I liked this dress so much in the store - but didn't have it in my size - so had it shipped (and yes, paid shipping costs...) but it just didn't work on my body. the top is sort of poofy for lack of a better word - it made me look kind of poofy all over and really - i am not poofy! it's a lovely color - and might look terrific on a tall woman - but at 5'3" - not so good - had to return, sadly.
3 Wow. this didn't work for me. loved the red color and drape and subtle shine of the fabric. but it fit like a sack. and you could see deeply into the armpits from the side revealing my bra and more. way too long. i looked silly. maybe it was the size. i'm 5'3" and ordered the large. this was my first retailer dress order but i'm not giving up. maybe the petite would have been a better fit. don't think i'll try again with this one, however.
3 I had a feeling this might not work for me, so i decided to try it on in the store just to verify. i was quite right. i'm a tall gal with a size 36c, and it just billowed out and made me look wider. i normally wear a size m in tops and even this was a tad loose.if you're petite/smaller framed, this will probably work for you. if you're tall and busty, this doesn't do us gals any favors, in my opinion.it is a lovely top, and i loved the velvet trim at the bottom, the inner lining was decent,
3 So i haven't actually tried this and i'm sorry for the misleading star rating. i just wanted to get someone's attention on the length. the photos show the dress draping with almost a train even with the model in platform heels but in the video, the dress is about 2 inches off the floor. is it the model in the video that is extra tall? someone help me out. this looks gorgeous but since it's an online exclusive, i won't be able to try it on at the store.
3 I stumbled upon this item at my local retailer, and immediately had to true it on. the colors are so lovely in person. after trying it on, i was disappointed :( the material has a foamy/air feel to it, and the skirt seems to run small. needless to say, i didn't purchase this item.
3 I'm 5'9" and 155lb. i have been wearing small a but this was realllllly small especially at my arms. it made me look like i was taking off... much more beautiful on the model. a medium would e been too big on my torso. the color is amazing! made my blonde hair really pop. i don't love green but this was so different.  would love to find something else in this color that suits me! you need to be a super skinny waif to look good in this!
3 I really like the pilcro serif style but the stet style does not work for my body. will have to return.
3 This dress runs a bit small. the large arm holes were unflattering to my small chest. also, this dress seemed to make my belly protrude. it kind of made me look pregnant in a way that no other dress has! i could see this dress being flattering on someone with a very flat stomach or a large chest. not me!!
3 This dress is really beautiful. very well made and high quality fabrics. unfortunately, it is cut very narrow. i am between sizes, ordered up and still felt like it was at least a size too small. i think if you have any curves in your midsection that this dress is going to be a challenge. if you are lean and straight then this will look great on you.
1 I saw the photo of the young woman wearing this dress in the reviews and she looked beautiful, i on the other hand looked awful. the fabric of the entire dress is quite stiff, so the dress didn't move with me; it sort of felt as if i was wearing a paper cut out. then to contribute to the volume, the sleeve is not set in, it is a raglan style, that on me looked more like a bat suit, than what i was hoping for, a beautiful distinctive dress for an important affair. also the belt didn't enhance the
3 This skirt ran short, small, and boxy. if you can get the right fit, the skirt is great quality and super cute, but i recommend trying on in store for sizing.
3 The fabric of this skirt is absolutely beautiful. however the fit, albeit unique, is not extremely flattering in my opinion. it may be because i am somewhat of a pear/hourglass shape rather than a more straight shape, but the fit is a little off imo. i am 5'8" and 135# and ordered both the 6 & 8 and felt the 8 fit a little better.
3 I am typically a small at retailer, but always order a small and medium to try since i'm tall. the color of the green is really pretty, and i can see wearing it on the weekend with casual sandals, and dressing it up with a cropped jacket for work. the sizing is way off on this dress, though. the small is too short for me (personally). i'm 5'8" and the waist doesn't sit low enough for a drop-waisted style. so i tried a medium. the medium is not sized correctly at all. i tried it on and it fits 3 si
3 I purchased the sand color (beige/) one size up from my usual xs to allow for extra room around the hips. the dress fit a little large so the extra room wasn't necessary. the fabric was much thinner than i expected for the price point. the dress was sheer and on my lighter skin tone looked more like a lab coat than a dress. this may be stunning on someone a bit taller. at 5'4 it just hung on my frame and didn't do much for me. the pockets are a nice touch but overall the cut was unflattering and
3 The pattern and fabric on this dress are very nice. there is just too much fabric. it's much too baggy but could make a nice maternity dress. i'll be returning it.
3 The idea of this dress is lovely. the fabric is pleasing to the touch. the print manages to be eye catching but understated. i don't know my exact measurements but i typically wear an extra small and i rarely have fit issues with off the rack clothing. i read the other reviews about the odd fit but decided to take a chance. i ordered an extra small in this dress and the bottom half fits perfectly. the top fits poorly. i have a fairly athletic build but it is a bit too large for my shoulders. how
3 I purchased the 0p online and it was so incredibly short on me it wouldn't even serve as a tunic!! it was also so tight in the bust area that i could not pull it down because there is absolutely no give in the material. the berry color was not as bright as it had appeared online but in fact was a very muddled color that seemed to make the material look even more cheap. i would need to size up considerably to have good fit without give in the bust and arms and judging by the structure of the dres
1 This blouse is a disappointment . fabric is cheap looking and the cut is very off. just odd. sleeves awkward . the back of the white shirt on the on-line model is not the same as the white shirt i received. mine was plain in the back like the blue shirt on line even though my shirt was white. no ruffle. returned.
3 Maybe it's just that it's a bath robe, but i'm not crazy about how this falls. it is very soft, cozy, and cute, though.
1 The top looks better on the model than in-person. it fits loose and looks boxy and matronly. i don't like the sleeve length or the top style, it just didn't look flattering or good. i am sending it back. looks very boxy.
3 I love ponchos and the colors are gorgeous, but the pictures make it look much longer than it is. i would've loved it if i were petite but i personally don't think it's meant for taller people. such a shame.
1 I ordered the ivory of this dress, expecting it to be a nice dress i could wear into my second trimester of pregnancy. instead, i received a dress that looks like a ugly, vintage-gone-wrong curtain of fabric. the 'ivory' is the color of yellowed newspapers. the fabric was cheap and had thread pieces sticking up all over the place. i would've been better off sewing myself a dress out of drapes a la gone with the wind or sound of music. the fit isn't that great, either. big and boxy. it could acco
1 I am floored by all of the positive comments about these culottes! i can see that they would work for someone who is rail thin and has no hips... but for those of us with curves (i'm a size 12, hourglass), these are very unflattering. they made me look like i was carrying an extra 20-30 pounds, just around the hips! so bummed because they look so cute on the model.
3 I saw this skirt online and went to the store immediately to try on. i was a bit disappointed. the size is tts but the prints were prettier online. the material is ok. the regular is long so probably won't look good on a shorter personif it is still available when the price comes down, i might buy it.
3 I saw this top on sale and tried it on right away. my normal medium was too big, so i purchased the small in the rose color. wore it with a shimmery kimono and cream colored pilcro boyfriend jeans. wow, what an outfit!!!!then i washed it according to directions, and sadly it shrunk into a crop peplum tank. i was so disappointed. i wished i had read the reviews beforehand.
3 The dress is pretty and like retailer it is nice quality, i just didn't keep it because it had no shape on me and even with a belt didn't look right. i would have gone down a size in this dress also.
3 I was so excited to get this dress and could tell right away it was beautiful. the fabric and detail are perfect and seem great for summer. then i tried it on ....to say the bust area is tight and not proportioned correctly would be putting it very nicely. it was a total joke. this dress is for very small chested only.
1 This is a beautiful kimono but just isn't made well. the one i received already had a couple small holes and a pull in the thread that was very noticeable. after reading the additional reviewer who wore it an hour and it was already pilling, it is going back for good. such a shame!
3 This is a very cute dress. it was perfect before i washed it. the problems i had after washing it was the outer cotton layer of the dress shrunk length wise while the inside black lining did not, so the black lining peeks out a good inch or two. and since the dress is shorter i can't really wear it without using biker shorts, especially for the back of the dress since it's shorter there and if i bent over you could see everything. i'm so disappointed in the quality because it is a very cute, ver
3 Scratchy, wide cut = not flattering, i tried to make this work because i wanted a different, unique cardigan. but.... the color is not for me either.., it's yellow/ivory. bummer! so cute on the model! the snaps are my very favorite part!
3 I loved the lavender color on the cape. it was soft and comfortable. but the design on the front ruined it for me. it took me all of 1 minute to know it was going back. it looked like florescent bird feathers nothing wrong with that, it just wasn't my style at all. i was a bit disappointed as it would have been perfect for cool ca nights. it looked more subdued in the photo, it's not. i clicked i would recommend to others as it is nicely made and i guess just not my taste as far as the colors an
1 I thought this dress would be a cute beach cover up so i was excited to order it but i was very disappointed. i am 5'7 and i usually wear a size small top and 4 dress so i ordered a small in this dress but it was huge!! i understand that it is not meant to be form fitting and i wasn't expecting it to be but when i tried this on i felt like i was wearing a potato sack. i feel like an extra small would have been just as bad. i was so upset. it also has thin silver lines through it which, for me, m
3 I really wanted to love it but it was way too maternity on me. i love flowy but the flow on this dress hit me in all the wrong places. but i must say i have a 34ddd bust and wear a medium regularly. well i sized down and ordered a small and it just didn't work. it just flowed right off my chest to what looked like a dress concealing a baby bump. overall its cute just not for me.
3 I love the style of this top. hand washed before wearing and it looks like a rag before i even got to wear it. very disappointed since i thought it would be a very practical tank.
3 When you buy a dress full price and it goes on sale before you can even wear it ($168 down to $49) uuuuggghhh... i like the dress fine enough, but it has a weird under wire, it makes my chest look strange, like i don't fill it in. i usually don't have that problem as a c cup. more orange/red then yellow as well. wouldn't recommend.
1 This dress really was huge, and not at all flattering. i don't know how they got it to look good on the model in the picture. material was nice and soft, but i really don't see how anyone could look good in this, no matter what your body shape is.
3 I really loved the look of this dress online and couldn't wait to try it on. based on my measurements i ordered a petite medium, following the petite size chart. the dress was the perfect length for my 5'5 frame, but it was just way too loose and not flattering on my figure. i'm 36c-32-37 and i looked like a sack of potatoes in the dress. the fabric and lining feel great though. i just wasn't the right fit for me.
3 I wear a typical 25 in coh jeans and i ordered these in a 25. they fit but they feel more like jeggings than skinny jeans. the wash isn't as faded out as in the picture. and at 5'2" the rip is right at my kneecap. i bought these for the distressed wash, and will probably return this pair as it looks darker and less faded in person. i look nothing like the model does in this pair of jeans.
3 There comes a point where i have to draw the line with things i purchase... i ordered this as i didn't have a black skirt, but thought ti wasn't special enough, don't get me wrong, it fits nicely, and is comfortable, but i was wowed. 0p or xs p fir perfectly, 26.5 in waist and 115 lbs. if you want ta nice casual skirt, the sale price is a good fir for the skirt, just wasn't enough for me :-)
3 Pretty tee, but not worth the price.  lace is beautiful, but fit is blah.
3 I am a pretty consistent size 2 or 26. ordered these in my usual 26 and, yikes, right out of the package knew they''d be way to small. they have a lot of stretch in them so i was able to get them buttoned but they were wayyyy too small and looked awful. i returned them for a 27 which i am still waiting for. i'll update this review when they arrive. other than the size issue, they were just as pictured/expected.
3 I found the fit of this dress to be true to size with a flattering bust and waistline; however, the fabric feels cheap and doesn't drape as nicely as i'd hope for the price. this would be a lovely dress in a better quality fabric. for sizing reference, i'm 5'5'', 122 lbs, 30dd, and took my usual size xs - though i'm busty for my size, the top provides nice coverage.
3 While this top is pretty, it's very unflattering. it just looks so boxy on me that it makes me look heavier. too bad, because i really wanted to like it.
3 I have been looking for a basic ivory sweater. i waited for this one to go on sale. the style is cute but the sweater itself is very stiff and heavy. unfortunately i decided to return it.
1 I so wanted to love this suit. it was gorgeous - the color, the quality, the style, but i am returning and can not recommend it. the sides need to be connected just a little bit higher and i think it would work, but there is no way you could move around in this without things popping out in front. i mean it would be gorgeous to just lay there in the sun, but i didn't feel like i could even walk safely, and i am not well-endowed. very bummed but it's going back.
1 These are horrible pants!!! they run small in the thigh and butt like other cartonnier crops. look great at first....after a few hours of wear the stretch out everywhere!!! absolutely terrible! i have several pairs of cartonnier crops that are my "go to" pants, but these are not worth even the sale price! i'd give them no stars if i could!! this fabric is very different from my other printed pairs. if u must try them, size down and suffer through the first few "tight" hours! trust me...they will
3 The front and back of this square sweater are the same, and the pattern of the stitching makes it look like it's on backwards.the lace would be nice, but it's itchy. and the sweater is cropped, so i think the layered lace look is odd because the whole thing is so short on the body. the 3/4 sleeves make it look small and fitted, but the body shape is bulky. just couldn't get it to work.
1 I was really disappointed when i tried this top on. the design and cut of the neckline is very bulky and just off. the cut of the top overall was just off.
3 I love the pattern on this jacket and enjoy the bell shape. a fun jacket to through on and add quick style to a skinny pants.
3 This looks great on the model and is probably beat suited for someone that is tall and thin with small hips.
3 This dress looked really nice on the hanger but when i put it on it was shorter than expected. i am 5'9 and it hit way above the knees. too short to be a work dress which was what i was hoping. might work better on someone shorter.
1 Too tight in strange ways. beautiful dress i was so excited to receive it, however it just did not fit.
3 True to size on the neckline and arms but extremely large and puffy in the torso. very unflattering cut!
3 I ordered this in lime, which is one of my fave colors. the garment was loose and roomy, and had the designer used elastic anywhere on the waist, i would have been in love! the shoulders were only tight due to the lack of flexibility in the bottom - no elastic at the waist and no placket below the waist to increase the ease of mobility taking the garment on and off - so if i had to use the ladies' room, i had to plan ahead. i took it on a trip and didn't have time to try on prior to leaving.
3 I love the maeve line and was excited to get this dress. unfortunately, the fit was just bad. the top fit fine but the bottom half was too snug and there were unattractive gaps around the waist and the pockets. don't think another size or tailoring would address the issue. for size, i am 5'4", 130 and ordered the 6.
3 At the beginning of summer, i first ordered one of these tops in size xl. i liked the colors and the material was such a soft, open weave. i thought it would be perfect for the hot weather so i ordered a 2nd on sale. unfortunately, even though these are made of mesh, these tops ended up being really hot. i wore them in texas, new york, new jersey, and florida. i thought they'd be a good, pretty choice. but, the material with the gathered waist & wrists, trapped in the heat. it was just too sheer
1 I saw this sweater on-line and loved it until i tried it on. i'm 5-7, flat chested, 135 pounds and i ordered a size small. the sweater fit everywhere except for my arms. this sweater will work great if you are short. consider making your sweaters a little longer, because i do not consider myself tall.
3 Loved this shirt but it runs pretty big. i'm normally a sm/med due to bust size (34ddd) and ordered a small based on other reviews. could have gotten an x-small. debating going to exchange. i ordered it in three colors bc it was on sale. better quality than some at retailer.
3 But-the problem is i cannot get the color to stay below the shoulders. the large appeal of this top is the over the shoulder look-but in just trying it on it would pop off the shoulders and make a cowl neck kind of top that didn't lay right. if it would have stayed it would have been a real win for me. i like the quality of the fabric and the longs sleeves, but i can't get the desired look to work out so this is going back.
3 I really wanted this to work. the embroidery detail is very pretty. however, the inside of the sweatshirt is a bit scratchy from the embroidery so i would recommend wearing a cami or tank. the sweatshirt is also on the short size. the small hit the top of my jean waist. in the end, i decided to return it:(
3 I bought these shorts last week in the cobalt blue color. they are super comfy and the color is beautiful however after wearing them for only a few hours i noticed a pull in the fabric that all the way down the front of the right leg. i'm extremely upset about this because they were relatively expensive for lounge shorts. i love the shorts otherwise.
3 This would be perfect if only it were lined!!!! i have a high waist and hourglass shape so jumpers are very hard to find that fit my body type. this is a perfect fit for my body shape and when on, it looks like a lovely dress. however, it is not lined and the material is very light and ivory so you see everything. you can't wear a slip so that leaves the option of some sort of bodysuit if you don't want to show the world what you have. i am very tired of all of the light colored clothing not bei
3 This is a lightweight knit dress that is well-designed but very form-fitting. i decided to return it because at almost 40 there are parts of my body that i don't need to show, but if you're in great shape or willing to wear shape wear, this would be super cute.
3 As with most retailer tops, this sweater is boxy and baggy through the middle.  i ordered an xs.  it's a very nice, pretty sweater that i'm going to try in an xxs.  the v-neck does go down rather low so it will need a tank underneath. the lace accents are very delicate and make the sweater look more upscale.  the white is a soft winter white.
1 I'm a petite so as usual i have to order from retailer. i saw this on line and tried it on in a regular size in the store. even though of course it didnt fit, the style of the tee was nice so i ordered it. i couldnt have been more disappointed when i received it. the quality was truly awful. i'm not even sure why it is being sold. the neckline was warped and wouldn't lie flat again the neck or chest; the bottom hem was crooked. it was really bad. also having purchased tees in similar material befo
3 I picked up this t-shirt at my local retailer today, immediately drawn to the super cute, colorful graphics, and the unique stitching at the collar, saying "giddy up!" to go with the cowboys, horses, cacti, and movie camera, (unusually!). the graphics are way cuter in person, as compared to the weirdly wavy-distorted and unclear photos shown online. if all i had seen was these photos, i would never have even noticed or recognized the design. go to your local store to see this in person, and you wi
3 I wanted to love this dress - it is gorgeous on the model, but unfortunately for me, it didn't fit right. i'm petite and ordered the xxs petite. it was snug in the upper body and looked like i was wearing a baby-doll dress. the material is high quality and i love the burnt red color. it just didn't fit right. definitely looks great on the model, but hung funny on me. i can see why it was highly rated, gorgeous dress - just not on me.
3 I bought this tank for work, but the color of the print is slightly muted compared to the photo. i usually wear a xxs or xs (i am 100 lbs, 5'1) and i got the xs thinking it will be loose, which i wanted. the arm holes were down to my waist, and it was also unusually wide. the quality of the fabric is nice though, not to heavy and not too thin.
3 I love this dress and bought it in the store in the orange, without trying it on as i usually wear a 12 in this brand.  the over-dress is beautiful, however the under-slip is very tight and is apparently made for some one who has no bust at all.  i am so sad and am considering returning it or re-sewing the slip in some way so that it fits.  not sure what to do. don't want to spoil the color combo by wearing something different underneath, but it is so sheer you need something.
3 This dress is adorable. it simply did not fi off the rack.i invested 15 dollars in alterations to get rid of the very bottom side pockets- why where they even there? and to shape the bottom. basically the dress is straight all the way down the sides.by up and alter....the top pattern and cut at the top made the alteration investment worth it to me- the quality of the fabric is excellent.and the pattern is adorable- can be worn as little black dress, cocktail party or date night. the top de
3 Would have loved this skirt, but the xl is closer to a size 12 than a 14 or 16. larger ladies beware!
3 I love the style of this top. i just wish there were a slimmer version of it. unfortunately, this top doesn't suit my long, slim midsection. it is so wide, it completely hides the waist. i think it would look adorable on a different body type.
1 I tried this shirt in a small (my usual retailer size) and it was very unflattering.   the fabric was ultra soft and it seemed it was nicely made.  however, this shirt is so unstructured and oversized, i might as well worn a brown paper bag.
3 Very well made, wonderful fabric. fit perfectly everywhere but the bust.
1 The tops looks fitted on the model because she pressed her arms against the clothes. to my surprise,the tops actually is very very very r o o m y below the chest area.the appliques/laces on the front are made of low quality materials.
1 I bought the black and gray fleece lined leggings. i thought the price was great. too good to be true. you get what you pay for. once i opened the box they smelled awful. it was a chemical smell. i washed the black pair twice and it was a little better. i have washed the gray 5 times and it still smells.
3 I thought this top was so pretty and airy, but it just didn't work out. i typically wear an xl in retailer and was able to size down to a l in this top. i ended up returning because the front is pretty sheer and the black tented out in a weird way about half-way down (there is a seam across and without this it would have hung perfectly). disappointed.
3 This was a fail for me. although i ordered size large it barely fit my midsection when tied and was too small in the waist. the fabric is nice though. best on thinner frames than mine.
3 This vest was of excellent weight but it had very little style. it was like a giant piece of felt was cut out with little thought to design or nuance. not for me.
1 The back of the shirt has a tag stitched in with red thread that goes through to the outside of the shirt. it is very visible and looks terrible - especially since the back is the focal point of the shirt. do not recommend
3 A little boxy but will be a go to basic. the off set ruffle gives interest
1 And the bottom looks like a tutu. first, i have high tolerance for scratchy fabric but this one i could feel it even through long sleeves. there is no way i could wear something that makes my skin itch so badly. second, the peplum part is huge and looks like an exaggerated skirt. finally, the color on the "green one" is darker than in the picture and it does have more of a green than blue tint. back it goes.
3 I was very excited to get this but very disappointed once it arrived. the fabric on the back is thin and clingy. i think you'd have to wear a slip underneath. cute design on the front but sadly it's going back.
1 Ugh, the fit of this dress is terrible :/ what a beautiful dress though -- the material and the colors -- had so much potential. but, the fit is awful -- i ordered by regular size and the top was more or less ok, if not a tad big, but hip down was crazy tight that i couldn't even zip it without a ton of effort. i don't think sizing up will help because then the top will be even bigger. disappointing.
3 There is nothing special about this skirt. it's plain and incredibly dowdy looking. long and wide. i am usually between a small and medium. after reading the other review that said the waist ran small i went with a medium. it fit fine in the waist/hips.
3 I wrote item ran large, but that was true only in length. it would be long for someone 5'10" . however the bigger issue is getting it on. the style and quality are quite nice, but it does have some issues.
3 I ordered this in black and white, thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles. i returned the black because it looked like polyester. the white is actually a cream/ivory, not bright white as pictured. it is also not the best feeling quality, however the fit is good, and true to size.
3 Unfortunately i had to size down twice with there pants. great feel, they're soft and the grey is a soft color.
1 I loved this dress online and was luckily able to locate it in a store about an hour away from me. i drove to the store to purchase it; however, when i tried it on, i was so disappointed! the print is adorable and it is made of great quality, but the swing style is definitely more than mini! i could have fit 3 of myself in this dress. it is definitely not as depicted in the photographs. also, the background of the dress is way more pink than appears in the photos, and the floral print isn't as r
3 I love the way that this suit looked, however i found that it was lacking in support. i was disappointed to discover upon trying it on, that it just does not cover my butt. it fit elsewhere just fine, but the slim cut up the sides left it a little too revealing for my liking. in addition i found the top to be awkwardly fitting around the chest area. i am a 34b and ordered a small and it seemed to be too baggy at the top.
3 I'm a pretty solid 10 these days (and had no trouble fitting into other size 10 dresses at the store). the large was so tight around my hips. i barely got it on. they didn't have an xl to try on, but i can't imagine i would have fit in it. so, if you have wide hips, this is not the dress for you. it fit fine on top in the l, it was just so tight in the hips that it did not lay nicely.
1 The title says it all....this fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design. the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials (shoulder is a knit, sweater-like navy fabric) is interesting. however, that is where the positive comments end on this one. the top is so scratchy,, stiff, and, frankly, uncomfortable. i cannot imagine wanting to wear it. it could benefit from a lining, and that might have solved the problem of scratchy, itchy fabric.the stiff fabric of the bo
3 Ordered it because i am fan of floral dresses.i found that colors are not as bright as pictured, overall color looks beige in real life. fabric has nice weight, not too heavy nor too light, it is not itchy, but not very soft either. good dress for colder weather. the sizing was right, i got my usual m and i am 5'10'' 145lb. the dress has a side zipper, but i did not need it. the dress is slimming and close to the body. the cut did not work for me: sleeves were too short, i had to pull them up t
3 I wore this coat one day and the buttons started falling off. it stretched so much. i'm going to beg my local store to take back. it shouldn't fall apart like that. it's super duper cozy though.
3 This is a beautiful looking dress, but definitely runs wide and long. i'm 5'4, 112llbs and my normal xs swallowed me up. if it had been available in xs petite then that probably would have worked, even though i normally never go with petites. it is a gorgeous dress, and would probably work on those ladies who are taller.
1 Similar to others here, these pants were ruined after one wash. the first pair i bought simply faded after one wash, which was okay, but the second pair got weird splotches on the backside. i'd rather not call attention to that particular area of my body;) could've been a great addition to my wardrobe if they were better quality.
1 Too much material everywhere. i am 122lbs 5'4" and i ordered an xs as usual. i was overwhelmed in a blanket of knitted material of muted colors. nice green slip, though. i will return it asap. this is super-ugly.
1 First problem-i would not have ordered this at all had the description been correct. the fabric description is cotton which the dress is most certainly not. secondly, it has a really funky, cheap, unfinished, raw-hemmed slip which is simply not fitting for the dress. the keyhole in the front is super long-again, does not seem to fit the dress. i am not happy with this piece at all but it did fit tts. length is just above knee. i am 5'5" 142 lbs 34d and the six was a good fit. sending this home t
3 Loved that this was an 100% boiled wool dress but unfortunately runs very large. i tried the small and extra small - both were really large in the hips. i will maybe try the xxs - was hoping to make this is winter staple.
3 Loved the bright pattern online and had hoped it had a similar fit to the tyla ts which i love. in actuality this was a lot boxier. the cut was shorter in length, too short for my 5'10 frame. the width was rather boxy and unflattering, particularly with the wide arm holes and flat cuffed sleeves. also the pattern looked a little cheap in person, way less spectacular than retailers typical gorgeous vibrant patterns. this is going back i'm afraid.
3 Like the other reviewers i was disappointed to receive the gray dotted sweatshirt with a zipper down the center when it was not in the model picture. looks like this item has since been removed from this listing...would have been nice to have the correct item pictured in the first place.
3 I have been searching for grey jeans and haven?t found anything that i truly love. i tried on both a 25p and 26p. the 25p was too tight and i don?t think they would have stretched out enough for me to be comfortable in. the 26p was close but i was afraid they would stretch out too much. they looked good from the front but did nothing for my cushion. the color, length and feel of the jeans was perfect. in the end they went back and the hunt continues for grey jeans. i would recommend trying these
3 This is a super cute tunic - it is simply way too big.
1 I was looking for a really warm, but stylish coat that i could wear when the weather is frigid as it sometimes gets here in the dc area. i tried on a size small, which is my usual coat size. while the coat fit, it was not flattering. for reference i am 5'9" 128 pounds and usually wear a small/xsmall in retailer tops. in this coat i looked like a linebacker with pads on. the front material is doubled, which makes you look like you have a large protruding stomach. the shoulders are bulky and
3 Beautiful and versatile dress but shoddy quality. i hand washed (per the instructions) it after wearing it once  and the sleeves are already falling apart.
3 I have been eyeing this piece for months now! i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock. i am 5 '4 and 110 lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs. i think the top is too baggy for me. yes, the top and bottoms fit overall, but it doesn't look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model. it is very sheer--which is the thing that discourages me the most. i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work, which i am willing to work on s
3 I wanted to love this dress... and i did until i turned around. the back seam didn't hang right. it pulled towards the knotted side, across my behind. i tried on two different xs that they has in store and both had the same issue. one of the dresses hung much looser, i had to recheck the tag because i didn't believe it was the same size! disappointing because it really is pretty and showcases curves nicely.
1 This is more of an undershirt than a shirt. the material is very very thin and it shows everything. it was beyond unflattering on me. don't buy this unless you have a knockout thin body.
3 This sweater runs true to size. i am 5'7' and 125 lbs and ordered the small. it has a beautiful mix of colors that reminds me of a creamsicle. it is a well made, heavy sweater that will definitely keep you warm. if you like the feel of wool, buy it. if not, pass on it.
1 Bummed out.. this is super cheaply made and very expensive... the design is different , the color is beautiful, but the material is a different story.. it should be priced at the most 30 bucks.. not 128.. i'm returning them. also, they run very big..!
1 This is a rare review for me, i usually love my retailer purchases, even at times when other reviewers aren't fans, but this top is terrible. 5'4" 103, 32 b for reference, small frame, athletic, bought the xs in black. the length could have been longer, but i could have lived with the length. the arm hole area, however, a different story. because it's boxy, and the fabric is stiffer bc of the large flowers, the top sticks out on the sides under the arm holes leaving a gape, it did not fit snuggly
3 I ordered this top online and was hoping to love it, however it didn't fit me properly...the arm holes were much too large (i'm typically an xs or small) i ordered the small and based on this fit i don't think the extra small would've fit either :( also i thought the material seemed very delicate and somewhat thin....and with 3 kids always hanging on me i don't think this top would last very long...
3 It's not as form fitting & hour-glass shaped in real life as on the model. i think they must have clipped it in the small of her back so it does not look so boxy. otherwise it's nice.
3 I likded this but tried it in two sizes and it was still too big in the armpit. my bra showed. i am about a d cup, smallish in other proportions (125, 5'6") and no bra worked with this so that i wouldn't have to worry about my bra showing. nice fabric and drape. maybe good for someone who doesn't need a bra?
3 I really liked this top when i saw it online. i went to the store to check the sizes. i am a small or a medium. i tried on the s and the xs. even the xs was huge. unfortunately the xxs is sold out. i don't understand the sizing on this at all. it's a shame because the top itself is very pretty. just be sure you try it on before purchasing.
3 After seeing this dress online and noticing how quickly it sold out, i was curious about it, but thought i was out of luck. it just so happened that i ran into the store and they had one returned in my size. i tried it and wasn't sold. however, i loved the color. it was snug across the shoulders and arms. the rest was somewhat flowy, but boxy at the same time. i ended up bringing it home to think on it. after trying it on again, i realized the snugness across the shoulder really caused the top t
3 I loved this trench on the web site, i couldn't wait until it arrived and was even happy to pay full-price to get it! it unfortunately just didn't complement my 5'2" 135 lb curvy figure as i had hoped. it was definitely much fuller on the bottom which added unnecessary bulk. i have narrow shoulders and it was snug and uncomfortable with a simple tank top on. i hung it in my closet for a few weeks, tags intact, continuing to try it and each time it just wasn't working. it also had many stray thre
3 Love the dress and went a size up as recommended by other reviewers. but it was still too small. it's just not roomy enough in the chest--total boob squash. had to return it.
3 This top is beautiful! but the fabric is really stiff and itchy. in addition, it's rather cropped or short. the real disaster and heart break for me was when i washed it. the tag recommends dry cleaning, but allows for hand washing. i should have dry cleaned - it shrunk even more when i washed it on delicate setting in cold. too bad, because this looks so cute the first time you wear it. if you're up for a dry cleaning bill and don't mind a little stiff scratchy material, you'll be fine buying t
3 The color and embellishment of this top are beautiful. this would look great on anyone super lean, otherwise you just look really wide as there is no frame in the torso of this top at all. the back picture shows it well. i am 5'9, 142 lbs and i ordered the small and medium and both were huge! with regrets going back.
3 Super cute, flattering design but the material is itchy so it's going back:(
3 I love this skirt and wish i could keep it. but it is not for the vertically challenged. i am 5'0" 130 lbs and the medium petite was about 4 in too long, even with wedges. my intent was to wear this with sandals so i have to return. boo.
3 I fell in love with this trench when i first saw it online but ended up returning it once i tried it on. i'm 5'9, 140 lbs and the m fit true to size. but the belt hit above my natural waistline and the skirt of the coat was much fuller than i expected, making me look heavier. the material also wrinkles easily and the stitching was poor quality with lots of loose threads. disappointed, as the color and concept were great.
3 But i didn't like the fit. maybe because i ordered petite and the length threw me off, but they weren't flattering in any way. the color and material were unique and pleasing. had to send them back though.
3 I loved the colors on this dress, but i don't like the way it fits. it is tight around the shoulders, but the rest of the dress is really big and has no shape
3 The xxs petite fit great except in bust and shoulder area. i'm a 32a and it was really tight.
3 This dress is such a crazy beautiful color, the picture doesn't do it justice. i ordered this right when i saw it, and i almost love it. the color is very bright and the fabric seems nice, but i just didn't find it flattering at all. the slip wasn't the nicest, but completely not a deal breaker. i didn't think it was overly flattering on the model either, so i was hoping by some miracle that i would like it anyway, but something about the way it's cut is just a little off for me. it was very tru
1 Just a ginormous, shapeless shirt. runs extremely large. i am normally a medium to large in shirts and the medium was huge. i can only imagine an xs would work and i am no xtra small!
3 I had a really, really difficult time reviewing this dress. the instant i touched it, i wanted to love it! in theory, it should have worked for me. fit and flare is usually a really great option for my pear shape. the silhouette shows off my thinner upper body and camouflages my thicker lower body. best of both worlds! however, as you can see for yourself in the photo, this dress makes me look pretty big. i'm a solid size 8 and i feel this dress makes me look like a 12. it really makes my middle
1 Not a pretty blouse - it's quite utilitarian in design - and it runs enormous.
1 This sweater was so itchy i immediately was turned off. it looks cute in pictures but another problem was that the knitting in the shoulders looks like a kid made it. it was uneven and stretched out. it looked like it was not well made to me. it also shed so much that just from me trying it on my pants were covered in orange fuzz. i returned this one.
1 Sadly, this has to go back. i am 5'5", 128 lbs and this shirt is super short on me. very short. and it's so wide it's almost a trapeze cut. the overall effect is 50s/60s style maternity shirt. which is disappointing because the fabric is beautiful, the detail is nice in person, even the sleeve cuffs are great. i am not very tall and i'm fairly thin on top so i can get away with a lot of styles, loose and tight. the combo of short and trapeze is just unflattering.
1 I got fooled by this dress's description. it's 100% polyester and not wool as it claims to be! looks cheap.returned it!
3 I really like the color of this and the feel, but that is where it ends. it does not come with the gorgeous flattering belt that it is pictured with, and is cut without shape so it does not fit to your body and show off any glorious womanly curves. i could purchase the belt with it, but i don't prefer to purchase products that cannot stand on their own.
3 The material is soft and the pattern is pretty, but it fits like a sack. it's too bad that this wasn't more form-fitting, with some stretch and a zipper, because its fit is just not beautiful. for tall, very slender ladies, this will be pretty, as it is in the photo. it fit me just fine (with a little extra room on top), but it went right back into the bag without a thought.
3 Way too big and unflattering. i would love it to look like it does online but it's huge in person.
3 I fell in love with the shirt when i saw it online; but, i was incredibly disappointed with it when it was delivered.  on the positive side, the macrame is stunning.  once again, there was way too much fabric which makes me look pregnant.  most importantly, the color is not peach!  it's almost a burnt indian red or brick red/orange.  it was a disgusting color.
3 I'm 5'1" and this top was too long for me. it's pretty but expensive for what it is.
1 After reading the previous review, i was pretty confident in ordering this dress. it arrived in the mail today, and i was so disappointed. first of all, it's huge. the medium was way too big on me, and i'm never a small at retailer! (i even considered ordering the large in this - my normal size at retailer.) second, the colors are not as vibrant as in the photo, and the fabric felt cheap. finally, it just looked like i went to hawaii and bought a drab dress there that didn't fit right.
3 I bought this scarf/dress for 20% off on mother's day weekend. i really like how it looks and can be worn over a bathing suit or just as a dress, but it is not worth the money. it is poor quality, a scarf stitched together with an attached chord that you tie around your neck. you can make this yourself or wait until it is at least 50% off the original price.
3 I love tunics and really wanted this to work. i got this in a size s and it is absolutely gigantic. everything else about it is great, and i still haven't decided if i will try to swap it for an xs, which is definitely not my usual size (which is usually m, but often s at retailer). the pink/red color was quite pretty. if you have broad hips, fear not - you can size down and this top will still be generous around your hips. basically, if you're deliberating between s and m for this top, get
3 Very cute dress, just way too big. i ordered it online, wish i would have gone a size smaller.
3 I love this top, but i washed it once, in cold water, and hung it dry. it shrunk just enough that it's now too tight around the bust and gaps open up between buttons there. so disappointing! i will have to send it back.
3 I was so glad to find such a beautiful item made in the usa. i knew the workmanship would be above average. the embroidery is gorgeous and makes these jeans so unique. i am usually a 24 in pilcro slouchy chinos, size 0 in most pants , 25 in jeans so i ordered these in xs. the waist was at least 7-8 inches too large. they were enormous in every aspect of fit. no belt could possibly make these stay up. very disappointed . i would recommend an xs if you are a size 6 to 8.
3 It looks so cute and i love the detail on this dress but it was not flattering on me. light summer dress and that was exactly what i needed but i had to exchange it with something else.
3 I got my usual xs (i'm a 32b) and the top fit fine from the chest up. my head just fits through the hole on top without having to unbutton. but then from the chest down, the shirt billows out too far. it hits me at the hip like the model (i'm 5'6" and wear 2/26) but because of the extra fabric it really needs to be longer to balance out the trapeze look. since the top portion fits nicely i almost want to keep it then have a seamstress take it in a little at the waist so it's more a-line than tra
1 The pleats on the bib make this look like something from chloe sevigny's wardrobe on the set of big love. and the shoulders are cut for an offensive lineman.
3 Customers beware, there is no lining on this dress. i love the pattern however it would be a nightmare trying to find a slip to match the dress! i ordered it on line but i'll take it back to the shop.
3 Nice color and great work but runs little large.
3 I was excited to buy this sweater based on the online pictures.  although the ombre coloring is beautiful in person, i did not like the metallic trim at waist & cuffs.  the pictures don't really show the extreme brightness of the trim.  it looks literally like xmas ribbons were sewn into the sweater.  to me it looked like something a child would wear.  i ordered the 1, which was the smallest size offered.  it is oversized without much shape and i felt it added bulk around the middle.
3 This is a beautiful piece but the cut is not flattering. i ordered my usual small and while the top fit, the fringed part was huge, kind of "maternity." i can only imagine there was some clothes-pinning going on for the photo. this would have been great if it had about 4 inches of fabric removed from the lower part. obviously, it cannot be altered. so sad, must return.
3 Beautiful top but it didn't fit. i am small chested with wide shoulders, normally wear a xs or s - ordered the xs and it swallowed me.
3 This was my favorite item in the august catalog & i knew i had to have it. my store had not received it yet so i ordered online. after reading the other reviews, i sized down and the fit is still much too large as this top has way too much material. this is coming from someone who loves swing tees and can appreciate a loose fit. however, this top hangs like a tent. also, the elastic around the bottom of the sleeves is quite uncomfortable. i do think the top is pretty and recommend only if you ar
3 Low waisted, weird liner.
1 Granted that i am not as reed thin, or as young, as the model. but i am tall and reasonably slender. i have long hands and small wrists, which would be a factor in the overall effect of this garment. this poncho looked like some sad old stretched out who-knows-what that you'd keep in the car for emergency purposes, in case you needed warmth if the car broke down in a snowstorm -- and i have one of those foldable reflective blankets in the glove box for that purpose. i was looking for a statement
1 Looks great in the picture but when i got this in the mail the fabric was so stiff! shaking it out did nothing-almost like it was dipped in drying glue. i got this for $10 which is so cheap and i still returned it!
3 I order from retailer regularly and am pretty consistently a 0 petite or xxs petite. i ordered this in a 0 petite and it was like 5 inches too small in the rib cage and chest area. even if i would have got it zipped up, the halter cut is cut narrow so you can't wear a bra for sure...strapless would be necessary. also, the actual neck part was tight. for reference, i am 5'3", 108 pounds and a 32c bust. it seems you need to be flat chested to pull this one off and maybe missing a few ribs.
