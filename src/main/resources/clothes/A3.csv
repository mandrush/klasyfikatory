other This dress fits really cute. i actually think it's cuter in person than on the site. really flattering. the skirt hits a few inches longer on me than it does on the model, so it's appropriate for work and networking functions. i'm 5'3, 110lbs. i got the 0 and it's great!
other Lovely small whale cords. they fit too tight around the waist for me. unfortunately i will have to return.
other My favorite new dress. i love the feel and slight weight of the fabric. it's very flattering and easy to wear.
other Love this shirt. i am actually pregnant and this shirt ties right over my baby bump to make for a very flattering pregnancy shirt. i will definitely be wearing it post pregnancy as well since the tie is an actual tie and you can tie it however tight you want for a more fitted or loose look. i am 5'other 12other lbs (not pregnant) and got a size small. and it fits perfectly. covers problems areas of butt and upper thighs, yet accentuates the waist. and thinner area of legs. very soft fabric, a bit stretc
other These pants are just as beautiful in person as on the website. the fabric is luxuriously soft. two things to note: they are very lightweight jersey material, and they run a bit small. if you're in between sizes, you might want to size up. it's possible they'll stretch while wearing. i also wish they had pockets, but they just have a one small back pocket that's not sewn down and seems made for perhaps a tissue but nothing else. all of these "flaws" are made up for by the fact that these are abso
other Great piece. using as a night gown. slept in it last night. like a dream.
other I love this dress! i was apprehensive about it at first, because of the light material and boxy style. turns out the material is very flattering, and it hangs very well. the style isn't as boxy as it seems. it still flatters the figure without showing all your imperfections and it doesn't fit like a tent. i am 5'4" and i ordered the petite. it's short enough to show off you legs, but not too short. for being less fitting, i like the balance of the short length, and it looks great with heeled boo
other I liked the top, it is cute, but i didn't keep it as i have similar tops like it and i had better options. however:color: it is true that htere are differentials in the coloring of fabrics in this top, but that is not necessairly a bad thing, it kind of gives t personality.lace part (this is where i have a similr one, tank all alce like that): darker ivory, drkest part of hte shirt. cut to neck is flatetering, and different from the low lunging things we see a lot of.body: true to size, i
other I knew i would love these pants because of the cute sailor styling, but the unusual green color. i am 5'5" and thought i would be stepping on them, but i am fine. they are longer than the picture with the model on the website which i expected, but they are fine. the fabric is beautiful and i can't wait to wear them with my white-on-white sneakers. i will also mix it up with sandals. i wrote below that my style is bohemian, but truthfully i dress in all the ways listed below...classic, romantic,
other Order yourself a pair today! my new favorite jean, especially for spring/summer. good color and very comfortable.
other I fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and got it as soon as it went on sale 25% off. the colors are vibrant and the fit is perfect whether you have areas that you want to hide or not. it is true to size and i can see how you would want to size it down since it's baby doll shape, but it didn't work for me around the arm holes (and mine are not that big). i am 5'3" and 120 lb and size other worked perfect.
other This is a problem i have had with the pilcro hyphen cargos with the color dye.the dyes in these pants are the same thing. i wore the purple color and washed in cold, gentle, cycle and they were stained/ i will return these -it's too bad because they were pretty comfortable and flattering pants.
other Really unattractive shirt. nothing good i can say about it. horrible fit. i can't imagine this would look good on anyone.
other I ordered my normal size large and am sadly returning because it's overly large and long on my frame. the slight dolman sleeves are too long and wide and better suited for longer arms than mine. love the pointelle sleeves. they add a soft feminine vibe. hard to tell from the photos, but the texture is almost fuzzy.  the gray color is beautiful and  its actually made from multi colored beige and gray that looks silver in the light. it doesn't itch or shed. i don't like it enough to try a smaller
other I bought this dress on a whim.  i am so glad i did!  got it in black.  it is stunning and comfortable
other This is a very unique piece. it seems to be easy to wear and it is very comfy. but i normally wear a medium/size 8 and it was too big. i might size down to a petite medium of just go for small. it seems this might be a trial and error type of outfit.
other This skirt runs small because of the stitching around the hips. the waist fit fine but the hips were very snug, and i'm relatively slim in the hips.
other I tried this on in the navy/white combination and loved it, except it is cut rather full or large through the waist especially. if you can size it down so it fits you, you will love it. it is very soft; an easy top to throw on, feel comfy, and look fantastic! i sure wish it was smaller :/
other I ordered these in eptites, tey were a ltitle long still. also a tiny bit on the loose side. i am not sure i think they are worth as much as they cost, so wil lwait for hte sale. color combination was nice though,a dn the cut relatively flattering, i jsut ahve seen better out there for hte price. nice business/casual pant.
other I love this sweater! i ordered the dark gray and wasn't expecting fabulous but that's what i got. the skirt below the waist tie is actually pleated so that it falls perfectly. the seaming detail is beautiful. i am between a size large and extra large and the extra large fit perfectly. the sweater is short, half way down my hips but looks good over a long tank. this a medium weight knit and will be wearable all year with skirts, dresses and any kind of trousers. this is one of my favorite purchas
other This is a wonderful style.
other Love this top. the material is light, soft and comfortable. one thing to note. it runs very large? this feature is perfect for me as i was worried it would be too tight around the middle?this style would not look good if it didn't fit loose?..so i was pleasantly surprised to see that it fit me with plenty of room?.something i need for my full figure. if you are trim around the middle i recommend going down a size or two.
other Super cute dress for fall. detail is much more intricate than what you are able to see online. not too long and will look perfect with tights and boots.
other This top is simply amazing! it's a statement top everyone should own! the green is so rich and full of life! and the floral pattern is just beautiful!! i got so many compliments on it and i felt like a million bucks! confident and trendy! love love looovvveee this top!
other Beautifully cut and styled!its versatile and can be paired with trousers or a skirt
other Great fit. colors look just like the pic. not too heavy but, warm and cozy.
other These are a great versatile pair of black pants. they look chic without trying too hard and they work well dressed up or down. they do run a bit big as others have said. i generally wear a 16 and thats what i got in these but they're definitely big and bag out by the end of the day.
3 I wanted so badly for this dress to work on me. the design is amazing. the detail is so pretty and delicate. its my version of the perfect little black dress! however i have very big arms...and while i could have easily sized down for the body of the dress, the arms and chest in my normal size did not fit at all. i'm usually a 14-16 in dresses. i tried the 16 and it just didn't work. the arms were way too tight. however i've seen this dress on many other women with smaller arms than me, and they
other This sweater is heavier and has more of a swing shape to it than i had expected. but it is fitted enough at the top, that it still fit the bill. the pink is woven with a taupey color, and the effect is great. almost a little retro.
other I love this top! i gave it a four star because i wish it were a tad longer. i am short... 5'-other and it does work for me, but i do tend to like my tops longer. very cute and airy in the back!
3 The dress fits me like a tent and i looked pregnant. maybe this style isn't for me and i even sized down. otherwise the quality was lovely with an embroidered area on the top and the fabric style mixing was great and very trendy. it didn't work for me for the right person this is a very well made dress.
other This blouse is flattering and fits great. i also have the other color in cream with the floral design. very nice!
other I can't believe that i'm the first person to write a review. this top is so cute. i tried it on in a store and loved it. the sales person in the store said that it had been flying out of the store as soon as they got it in. the color and print are pretty. the fabric is sheer and cool and comes with a cami.
other Great fit with tight pants, beautiful flower design that goes with everything. favorite tshirt
other I was looking for a simplistic dress because i am graduating in a few weeks but did not really want to purchase anything. i strolled in the store and this immediately caught my eye. i tried it on and fell in love!! it fits perfectly and it is the right length. i love the bust line and the detailing of the straps in the back. i don't think i feel as though i am going to a wedding,but i will feel beautiful especially since this is really big deal and accomplishment. i am an older adult - so i want
other Great basic but with a little something special to it. great t all around!
other Love this vest! saw it and bought it instantly. i'm 5'8" and slim and got the xs. it fits perfectly. there is a lot of "puff" to it, but it's really warm and soft.
3 Nice quality and feel to the fabric but they are super lightweight and do not come down to the ankle. they fall at a strange place on the calf - a better cropped summer pant, perhaps.
3 Pretty disappointed in this sweater. should have sized down because it's quite wide. i also didn't like the stair step. the back clung to my rear. not attractive. the colors seemed to be striking online but in reality are not. returning mine.
other Color and style was pretty but the sleeves were so long i had to return it. cuffing the sleeves wasn't an option because you would lose the cute piping detail and see the inside seam.
other This top is so soft, simple, and such a closet staple, if you get the right size! for reference, i am 5'3, 128 lbs, and i ordered the petite medium. it's perfect. the black is a great color, hard to describe, kind of soft with some warm blush tones. i also ordered the white and the peach. great at the sale price!!
other This sweater is the perfect sweater except for one thing.....it sheds everywhere. i can simply pick up the sweater and shake it in one hand and 40 large pieces of lint go everywhere on the ground and on you. if you like dark jeans- don't purchase. before i walked out of the store- the salesperson had to use a delineator on me- it was hysterical. sheds so much
other I bought this in the black and white and like it a lot. i typically wear an xs or s, and purchased the small. glad i did because i think the xs would have been too snug. i like the tunic length and the fabric feels soft and smooth. it's a little low cut for me, but i'll wear a cami under it.
other This was the best purchase of the summer. it's cute and comfortable without being too baggy/loose. i get compliments every time i wear it. fits true to size. i bought the floral (orange) one. couldn't be happier!
other Nice quality material. the green is pretty color. just a good cozy top. i normally wear a large in retailer clothes and the large in this world was very roomy (which was fine with me). if you are short and have smaller shoulders and bust definitely go for a size smaller than you would normally wear.
other This sweater was not as featured in the picture. the front is completely cropped while the back is regular length. the front barely reached the middle of my stomach. also, the color was not as vibrant as shown in the picture. this sweater will be going back.
other I saw this top online, but i didn't fall in love with it until i tried it on in the store. the retailer salesperson told me that she owned this top and that she always received many compliments when wearing it, but she also warned me that the rhinestones on the sleeves were a problem as they kept getting snagged in the fabric on the body. i decided to purchase the top in the end because it is so beautiful and one of a kind, but i ended up removing all of the rhinestones on the sleeves and i haven'
other This is a beautiful and classic blouse. great fit and flow. however, the silk is very light and the snap falls off easily; tricky to sew back on since the fabric is so delicate.
other I absolutely love these pants! i was really hesitant to try these on for fear they would look like a diaper. i've always liked the look of these pants but didn't think i had the body type to pull them off being 5'5" with some curves. i tried them in my local retailer in the solid grey in both a medium and small. i could have gone either way but the medium fit better in the he hips. the draping isn't as exaggerated or bulky as it looks in the pic either so it didn't add weight to my frame. the mate
other What a cute top! it's a little on the short side for me (5'7") but i'm keeping it because it is so pretty. the lace is lightweight and delicate but seems like it will hold up pretty well. trying to decide what to wear under it, but i think it could look cute with a cami for work, or even a cute bra that has some coverage for super casual days. the lace is completely sheer but doesn't feel as revealing as i would expect. would be super cute over a swim top with jean shorts and sandals...wish i li
other This top is gorgeous, but the sleeves are all wrong. they're very tight for about 5" at the bottom, right up to the elbow making it tight when i bend my arms. it's also loose in the armpit area, the bottom of the sleeve starts under my chest, and is styled that way, so i'm considering returning. i actually drove an hour to the nearest store to size up, but the sleeve feels even more tight. ugh! i love the quality & looks otherwise, and the front is double layered so no need to layer. the front i
other I have this in black and red. it's a great and flattering dress that is a worn a bit large. you can wear it out on a date or more casual. the fabric is super comfortable as well.
other - this really is lovely. the overall design from the arms, front, and back makes this poncho unique. it's not too thick, either, making it a nice everyday sort of thing. however, it just didn't work for me. even though i'm 5'9", ponchos have a tendency to
other This blouse has too much drapey fabric and it's just not flattering.  in the front part of the blouse the fabric is relatively short, but the sleeves have so much excess fabric it almost looks like a clown suit.  sending back.
other I was so excited for this dress.. but sadly it did not meet expectations. the gauze fabric already had several snags/pullers in it. the underslip was very short and just cleared my derriere.(i'm 5'7") i normally take a 10/1other and ordered this in a l.. it was somewhat clingy in the hip area but yet bulky on top. also, i like to have the first button open, but you could then see the v neck of the underslip and it looked hokey. it's definitely a thicker material than the previous plaid tunic holding
other This is a beautiful, light-weight summer top. i ordered the white - perfect for summer. very feminine. true to size. i am 117 5'3 34b and the x-small fit perfectly.
other I wanted to love this dress because the fabric is fun, but i could not find a way to make the drawstring waist look like anything but a potato sack.the model has her hands hiding the lack of a waistline
other This top is simple but beautiful. i am either a large or xl but purchased this in the xl. it is a swing top, but has a beautiful flow to it which is not overbearing. i am around 5'6" and slightly on the broad side and do not feel overpowered by this shirt at all.i love a top that can be worn everyday with a pair of jeans or dressed up with a pair of slacks. the plus to this top is that it can born worn almost year round which i like.a great staple for your closet.
other Bought these jeans after reading others reviews and was not disapointed. these are the most flatering jeans! they give you legs for days, while providing amazing shape. oh and did i mention their soft as butter. huge win for me as jeans are one of the most difficult items for me to my as my waist is 1-other sized smaller than my hips and thes stretch marvilously to fit your body. they are on the pricier side and well worth it.
other I am not generally a fan of sweatshirts but when i saw this on a recent retailer email, i new i had to check it out. the colors are more vibrant in person and not muted like the photo but this wasn't a deal breaker for me. because of the boxy shape, i went with a s. i love the cozy feel and that it is still stylish. i can see this piece getting a lot of use this fall/winter. in fact, i am wearing it right now!
other These pants are a great addition to my work wardrobe. i needed to size up more so for my legs vs my waist, but nothing a little tailoring won't fix.
other I think i ordered this in an xxs because of the other reviews making it sound like it ran large. and i'm happy with the size and overall look of this tee on me. i'm 5'3" about 10other lbs and 34aa (i generally order xs or xspetite). the cuffs of the sleeves are pretty tight and the v-neck is higher than i'd like but otherwise i really like the loose, casual fit. there's no armhole seam, they're dolman sleeves. the tee i got translates to "the beautiful coast". it does say made in usa on the label. a
other This product is perfect for early fall wear. when the weather is a little cooler a shell worn under it will be fabulous
other I purchased this on one of retailer's 40% off sales, and got it for a great price. if you're looking for a pretty, comfortable t-shirt that's a little beyond the basic, this fits the bill. unfortunately the neckline was just a tad wide for me in the xs. i felt like it might show a peek of my bra, and when i adjusted it higher, the soft, stretchy material showed bra lines underneath. that issue, and the fact that the shirt is on the flowy side made it less-than-flattering for my small frame, but i
other Beautiful! color is true to pictures. no stretch. no liner. looks good with white or nude tank.
other If you're looking for a sweater that's super soft and comfortable, you've found it! you could wear this almost anywhere except for a dressy occasion, but then, of course, you wouldn't wear it with a dress anyway. i wish it came in other colors because i'd buy several. it's on the thin side but not too thin. the only thing that i should mention is that it's not a black black but more of a faded or brownish black which is really obvious with black leggings or jeans.
other Ordered my usual size 28 in pilcro jeans but these are on the small side. fit is a little small in the waist area, & don't mean to be crude but the crotch area is on the short side for me. legs fit snug, & i have skinny legs! i'll have size up to a 29. the twisted seam look is really cute. 5'3" abt 118# - too much ice cream lately.
other This dress is easy and attractive. it's very soft and just slips on, but looks very put together. on my shorter frame, it's a bit long, more midi length, but it's so comfortable and pretty, that i'm fine with it; it looks a little bit 20's that way. recommended.
other Thylo strikes again! this dress was magic the second i put it on - flowy, polka-dot magic! this baby can transform itself as you go from a casual day out to an dressy evening, with plenty of customizable options in between. to dress down, it looks great with a denim jacket, then take the jacket off and you are ready for some dressed up fun. you can pair it with tall boots or short, sandals, pumps, you name it. the ties at the neck look great undone, loosely tied, or done in a bow. leggings or ti
other This dress us high quality and feels great, however i am 5'5" and it is too long for me. will definitely need to shorten but love it, not above knee as pictured for a non supermodel!
other Perfect fall accessory and transitional piece for cooler days. classic red and black check with a fashion flair. great with jeans or dress it up with jewelry. a great find!
other This is a beautiful top. it is something great to have in your wardrobe for the holiday season or a nice date night option. i highly recommend it. it runs true to size. the price is actually reasonable as far as dressy retailer tops go as well!
other This is a perfect jacket over any shirt, tee, or dress. jacket is well made and goes with anything!
other Great soft tee. got the blue and really love the color.
other This is huge. i understand that's the style, but it looked like i was wearing my husband's size xxl. i tried to imagine a really cold day when all that extra fabric would be nice... but then it started to itch, and itch and itch!
other This dress is of excellent quality, made from fairly heavy fabric. the drape of the dress is beautiful - the dress definitely works if you're tall and slender. i'm 5'9, 32b, 125lbs, and i have the xs.
other Great transition into fall for layering. easy breezy dress up or down-is thin so it does need a cami
other I tried this top on today because i was really hoping i could get the shorts and robe set. the shirt was softer than i was expecting, but when i tried it on it was an uncomfortable fit. there was some tightness in the armpit area, which is not where i would have expected it to be tight. the rest of it was comfortable and reasonable looseness so i don't think a size up would have been a good option for me. i like the design a lot so i was really disappointed it didn't fit. it is between a lightwe
3 Delaine blazer so many little details with a slight bit of ruggedness. loved the unmatched buttons, checkered back and fraying that gave this piece personality making it appear less stuffy. easyily dress it up or down, that being said it seems to run true to size except the arms and shoulders were very tight. i would consider going up a size if more of an athletic build. ordered a other but i think a 6 would have been perfect!
other The fabric is very soft, love the purple floral color. the top is very flattering with the ease and comfort of a t-shirt.
other I don't usually pay full-price for retailer clothes, but i had a 20%-off coupon and i decided to give this dress a try, as it irradiated a happy vibe and reminded me of books and dress-up clothes from my childhood. i don't regret it one bit! the colors and the print are absolutely beautiful and i love how they mix up and contrast in a subtle way. i really like the long sleeves with the elastic at the wrist. the cord at the waist hangs with a fun mix of tiny beads, faux mini crab claws, and faux mi
other There'd a reason this dress is all over instagram and like. it's stunning and beautiful, perfect for a wedding or event. the beading is beautiful and the tiers on the dress are more flattering than you'd expect , especially since it does have a bit of pouff to it. love it, other stats! i sized up so that it would be longer
other Got the green one
other I love this dress as far as the fit goes. it makes my curvy figure loook even better with how it's cut. that being said the different patterns over each boob made the dress look crazy. it makes you look quite lopsided in the chest. wasn't just me, but my store people also agreed. had the pattern on the chest been the same it would be great, but even though my boobs are of "mostly" equal size, they looked too crazy. it's quite noticeable on. so sad:(
3 This is a very pretty jacket. light weight and perfect for spring/fall. i had ordered it online as it was not in my retailer store. i did end up returning it though. it does run large, i am usually a l/xl and based on previous reviews i did size down and get the l. the pockets for me were a little big an pushed out having an unflattering look! i was sad to have to send this one back! i was hoping to love it! someone smaller might love it!!
other Quality is great, fit is great, and the message keeps me in a good mood and motivated throughout the day :)i got it in a size other (i am usually a s-m in retailer tops) and it fits great (for reference 5'4" 140lbs, 37-29-39).i usually don't wear grey but the bright colored font led me to make an exception.very happy with the purchase!
other I love this poncho because it's the perfect weight and it is softer than i thought it would be. i will get a lot of use out of it. getting it on sale made it even better.
other Absolutely perfect and worth every penny! i am 5'8" and normally between a other and 6 in jackets. while the small fit, i ended up purchasing a medium so i had more room in the arms. insanely comfortable and truly stunning on. expect compliments when you are wearing it!
other This is my new favorite sweater. it is lightweight and drapey. very flattering. can be dressy or casual.
other Love the fit. nice and warm and good quality material.
other When i saw this online, i thought it was going to be a thin, summery kind of skirt with a fall pattern to it. it is not thin and wispy, but lined with a nicely weighted navy material and the fabric of the skirt is kind of a thick cotton with a nice swing to it. definitely would work for the fall and cool days or evenings. the zipper pockets look cool too, would definitely recommend!
other I love this top and the relaxed fit. can be dressed up or down. i bought the bird print and liked it so much i purchased the umbrella print. now i'm contemplating getting the mixed dot! easy to just throw on with anything and the mix of colors keeps it versatile too!
other This is a great piece to help ease on in to the chillier days of fall and winter. it's versatile- i can see myself wearing it with plain short or long sleeved tees or even tops with more elaborate padderns or button downs! there's so many options i cannot wait to put this gorgeous piece to use! just as an fyi, the sleeve openings are slightly unfinished and have a frayed effect to them. this may not even be noticeable if you're not looking right up close. for me, this adds to the unique quality
other I waited in anticipation for the turquoise version to appear online. turquoise and red can be found on another product page with the same name. size: i'm between small and xs for most retailer brands. i wanted this top to be a bit more fitted, so i ordered an xs. i'm 5' 5" tall, 13other lbs, 35-29-36, 34d, with long torso and narrow shoulders.fit: xs is spot on for me. i don't really mind the shorter length. it didn't appear to be too boxy. i layered a white shapewear tank underneath to help w
other I love my blue dress, i'm a pear shape to the top fit fine on me. i know reviewers complained that the top was too tight, not so on me. it was also not sheer on me because it has a cotton lining underneath. got a lot of compliments!
other Cute sweater! the side panels are perforated so you may want to wear either a nude bra or a cami underneath..
other I am petite (5'). even the xsmall petite looked sloppy on me. i also disliked the nude fabric under the lace- it made it look cheap. i wanted this to be the perfect lbd, i  just couldn't make it work on my body.
other I usually wear a medium or large in retailer clothes. i purchased this in a large and it fit perfectly. it is a clingier top but i didn't find it too much so. the ribbing makes it very attractive and slimming, and also can be worn as a stand alone turtleneck or easily as a layered piece. it is super soft and comfy as others have mentioned, and a tad thicker than just a cotton turtleneck would be - it has substance. also, it would be great for traveling because it doesn't wrinkle at all. love that!
other This blazer is gorgeous. the brocade fabric is beautiful. the color is really a blueish purple/indigo. you can wear it with a black skirt/pants and even jeans. the only downside is that it runs about one size smaller than what it says it is.
other In person the colors are prettier and it's more interesting than the front shot in the model. i tried on and bought my regular medium. got home and tried it on and realized it's too big:(
other I love how this long sweater drapes. it's soft -feels great on - and looks fabulous over leggings or skinnys!
other I love this blouse. it's a tad more billowy than i would have thought but looks fine. to wear to work i need to wear a camisole underneath as it's a bit sheer. and the button at the back of the neck broke immediately, but is still functional. the decorative part fell off. they give you a replacement button so if i decide it matters i'll sew that one on.i absolutely love the blue stitching on this and how crisp it is. i didn't realize it was dry clean only but that doesn't bother me.
other I love these pants! they fit perfectly and are great for casual days at work. great quality too! love!!!
other I love everything about this top! the fit and style are beautiful and the fabric high quality. it does run about a half size large (i'm usually a size other and needed an xs in this top). this is so versatile--i have worn it with a tangerine midi skirt and denim shorts and it looks great however i pair it. i highly recommend this!
3 This top is pretty and i did not find it sheer at all but i am returning it due to the lace sleeves are tight. but, i do have large arms! other than the sleeves i would keep it!
other So pretty, love hte design on this one.i tried on hte regualr size, adn will not need a petite, it hit me jsut above my knee. younger gals may oprefer shorter, however.the aottern is also nice. the cut is flowy and flattering, nothing bad to say about htis dress...
other Love the fabric that c s uses--so very soft and pliable.  fit is tts with room for draping over figure flaws and great for layering while open.  but the high-low hem is far more extreme than the new "action shots" show.  i'm kind of over this trend but at the same time love this shirt dress.  i'm 5'3" 140# 36d and tried on m but will order mp online because of length.
other I really like this dress, i wish they still had xxs p as the xs p is still a little big (i guess ti is the style). i love the eyelet design, the high low is very flattering, and the neckline too. very comfortable. i am not sure if i will keep it as i still think the xxs p would be more flattering, but i like it enough to consider keeping the bigger size.nice with a jeans jacket and brown clogs!(11other lbs, 30 dd, 26.other in waist)
other These bottoms are super comfortable. i think they run a little big for a small. i bought another swimsuit from retailer and the bottoms are also small and fit a little better than these. it goes well with the peplum swimsuit top. im so excited about wearing them this season!!
other I originally saw the sweater in one of the stores. it really is much nicer in person than online. i decided to try it on while there but was looking for other items, not sweaters then. i normally wear between xs and s depending on the brand. well, even the xs was too big. i thought i'd order it in a petite size since i am short but forgot about it once i got home with some other retailer items. i eventually did search it out but the xs petite was already sold out. i ordered the xxs?this fits but i
other Bought this on a whim, cocoon sweaters usually do not work for me. this cardigan is very cute, more of a dark gray. if it they carry again, grab it!
other The dress is very pretty, but the sequins are dark blue! i imagined they would be silver/gold, given the photo, but the dress is essentially light pink and blue.
other Super soft comfy underwear. i sized up and they fit perfectly. normally wear xs and bought m for most comfortable fit. they don't ride up. i ended up ordering other more pairs. super comfy without being too "mom" like.
other My daughter loves these, she wears them around the house all day when she doesn't have to go out.
other This tunic is very pretty in black. it is lighter weight than the picture appears and drapes nicely. i'm 5'other so i ordered the petite, but would have been ok with the extra length of the regular for when worn with leggings, with jeans the petite length will work well. i recommend using the size chart provided. i general wear an xs, but ordered the s, based on the size chart, it's a perfect fit.
other The details on this blouse - lace inset in front and sheer back - look just as great in person as they do in the photos. the fabric is wonderful too; the knit has enough heft that it doesn't show every body imperfection or detail in your bra. it held up well through its first wash and ironing as well. as others have noted, the style is versatile - easy to wear with a cardigan or blazer at work or to pair with skinny jeans or shorts on the weekend. i was also positively impressed by the color sin
other This skirt is so gorgeous. the picture doesn't do it justice. several layers of mesh. i am 5'10" and this skirt is very long, which i love. so glad i found this in my size for such a great price. highly recommended..
other This looks cute in the web photo, unfortunately it is absolutely huge in person. i got the small and have to return it because it is not wearable for me.
other I purchased these in white and love them! fit my muscular thighs fine.
other Unique print but not great execution. the pant legs are very tight, i have average sized calves and i sized up one size. the hook closure was oddly tight and difficult to clasp. when i first saw the color it looked like burnt sienna or a dried blood color. too bad this didn't work out.
other Agree with other reviewers that the dress doesn't look like the picture so retailerpligie should really change it out. however i'm keeping the dress since it does look cute on. definitely more yellow in it than you can see.
other I really love this shirt and bought it in several colors. i wish it came in white and in black because it's a great basic. i think it also works well for business casual attire.
other I was very excited to get this piece, but it wasn't quite right for me. very well constructed and nice material, but the open sides were a bit too open toward the front. the top zipper was tough to do on your own.
other I ordered a regular size s and it was way too boxy for my body type and shorter than the stated length. i don't know if the length stated is from a size m, but the small was definitely shorter (in the front at least).  if you're petite with curves like me, it's not a flattering cut.
other Absolutely stunning dress. true to size and flows like a dream.
other I really wanted to love this blazer...i've even tried it on several times hoping it would look better the next time around. (spoiler: it didn't :( ). overall, it makes me look pretty frumpy and not put together. i really love saturday/sunday brand and was hoping for a nice comfy blazer to wear to work. will be returning instead.
3 I wanted to love this jacket. so soft and great color. unfortunately it is just too light weight. it is almost like shirt fabric. nice heft to the fabric though. nice length - accept the sleeves were short on me. i am 5'10 and 135lbs. the small was the right size. i was looking for something slightly warmer to layer.
other I ordered this dress for a special event and i am so incredibly happy with it! i am 5'1", 97 lbs, 32b and ordered a 0 petite. fits like a glove. the dress has a slight give to it, but main dress fabric is a thick material so order your usual size. fits close through the waist and flares out below. the length hit above the knee so not too short, although i wouldn't want it any shorter. my main worry was whether my bra would show in the back, but i had no issue. overall, the dress is stunning with
other At last, in a world of loose, billowy silhouettes, a draped top that falls a little closer to the body! the fabric is of good weight and has the right amount of stretch.i also love the retro/vintage pattern of the fabric itself. the fit is feminine and comfortable.you will have to wear a camisole with this top, but i do not consider that a negative. it is the way of the deep v neck.
other This is a very beautiful dress, with the detail of the inside lining, with a very beautiful fabric as well, creating a double layer effect, it creates a great flow. i am not sure i would use it with the belt (which is beautiful, a part of it is crochet), but if i don't, the dress would be too long. i am a size xl and 5'6", so if you are shorter than that, i would try it before buying it. since it's getting cold here in colorado, i'll have to wait for next year to really experience going out with
other I tried this sweater on and  loved it immediately! it's super soft and comfortable, and very slimming. i tried my normal size s and an xs, and decided on the xs as the s gave it (and me!) a bit of a wider look. love the navy color!
3 I like this top, but it does not fit me correctly. i am 5'1", and have a larger bust, 3other c. this shirt fits in the length, but is tight in the bust. i would have to buy this in a medium. i normally wear an xs or s. the quality is better than most t shirts, and i ordered the red. the red is a deep and striking color, and one of the better reds i've seen this season. the biggest problem i had was the cut of the shirt. the top cuts in and doesn't provide coverage, my bras are not covered by this to
other While you can't count on the photo on your monitor to portray the exact color of an item, these photos are way off.  instead of the warm charcoal i see online, the pants are more of a dusty blue.  the material has very little stretch and i couldn't get into the size 24s.  the 25s were tight in the entire leg but huge in the waist.  for reference i usually wear a size 2other in brands like 7 for all mankind and citizens of humanity.
other I bought this shirt because the reviews convinced me to. i bought it in the blue color and it's really cute. the design on the sleeves is also great and the back of the shirt looks cute too!
other So lovely.  perfect print / graphic.  want to buy in both colors but the yellow is perfection.
other I agree with the previous review that this dress runs large. otherwise, it is a lovely dress, though i added a belt since the tie wasn't defining enough for me. brown leather looks great with it and i get tons of complements.
other I decided to try this dress on based on the other reviewer's positive words, and i wasn't disappointed! it's so cute and stylish. i plan to wear with black boots. i'm 5'6", 120 lbs, 34c, wear a other or 4, and i got a 4. one thing - at the waist, the pattern breaks a bit and doesn't match perfectly. i tried on a second dress and liked its pattern more than i did that of the first i tried.
other As soon as i saw this dress online, i knew i wanted it!  i was immediately drawn to the belled sleeves and lace embellishment along the neck/shoulders.  i ordered online, and was so happy with the fit and quality of the dress.  i am 5'other and it hits just an inch above my knee.  it's the perfect little black dress for a fun date night or an event!
other I purchased the washed-out blue color. it is lovely with blue or black jeans. medium fit great. it is heavier cotton, and ever so slightly stretchy. this is not the kind of cotton to eventually come out of the dryer with tiny holes around the bottom of the tee. it is very comfortable. the embellishment on the sleeves is a nice touch, and i like the yoke with loop closure on the back. a fun addition to my casual wardrobe.
other I'm 5'6 and between 100-105lbs. buying clothes from retailer is always a stuggle because i have a petite frame but i don't fall into the petite height range. i usually order a petite size and just deal with the shorter length, which is hard when you're all limbs. i purchased a 0r and i'm in love with the fit! the top of the dress fits under my arms perfectly! the waist of the dress also hits nicely. usually the waist of regular sized dresses falls below my natural waistline due to my short
other This color is gorgeous. this could be dressed up or down. great buy!
other This is truly a beautiful top. the beading and lace are subtle, but add such a special, feminine touch. i love the breezy, swingy shape. very flattering. this is one item i will be sure to treasure for years to come. love!!
other There's a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views. it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse. the print is lovely but the fit is very odd. it's pulls at and is very tight through the bust too. i wear medium or large and ordered size large. if you're less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you. but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide. returned.
other This is my new favorite top! looks and fits as described.
other I am so pleased with this tunic. the fabric heavy enough to wear through winter, and it is very flattering. the colors are as pictured, as well. as another reviewer mentioned, the slit is high. but it still works perfectly with leggings or mid to high rise skinny jeans.
other This is the perfect dress for going out and wearing to work (with a jacket or sweater and boots). it fits perfectly across the bust and waist and then has enough room to glide over the hips.the material is structured enough to give me a nice curvy shape and the embroidery is well done and beautiful. my husband picked this out from the catalog and loved it on me as well.
other I am 5'1" and 120lb with curves and muscles. i am tiny and slim but i have t & a in spades, a 34c and a bubble but. that said. this dress made me look tall and lithe. i took the xs petite because the xs the fringe was too long on the bottom. there is plenty of blouse on the top to accommodate the "girls" and you can pull the dress up or down to make it more blousy or more of a fitted column dress, to your preference. it's more of an antique ivory color and beautiful with gold or silver sandals.
other The top is adorable, but probably better to wait for a sale as the full price is a little high for a simple top like this. i got the print one and it's very true to size.
other I bought this in white at my local store. great staple to wear in the heat of the summer or as a layering piece. i bought my normal size medium and it fits loose and flowy. i wore a nude racer back bra and felt comfortable without a cami. great basic addition to my closet.
other I just got this tank and love it. it has the perfect amount of swing, but does run a little large. the underlay was more yellow than i expected, but i think it adds a nice amount of brightness to the top. this will be a summer staple.
other Gorgeous sweater - such a simple design, but really stunning on. seems to be true to size. definitely a nice winter piece that's got a hint of "dressy" to it - maybe for date night. my only wish is that it didn't flair so much at the bottom (wish it was a bit more straight) - but other than that, i love it.i'm approx 5' 5" and about 12other lbs. i purchased the "small".
other This is a great dress that looks better in reality than it shows on the website. the style is very flattering, fitting snug at the waist with just the right amount of flare. i am 13other pounds, 34dd and i bought a size 8 and it fit great. the material is soft and flowing and the cut was true to size for me. the first time i wore it a woman walked across the restaurant to tell me how much she loved my dress. this one is a keeper.
other I really wanted to like this dress. the color is perfect, the design and cut are cut (not always the case at retailer). however, the fabric quality was terrible - a shiny acrylic with cheap nylon lace. it looked like something from a discount store and had to go back.
other I totally agree with the last reviewer. i'm 5'2" 11other pounds with somewhat wide shoulders. the x-small fit my torso but was so tight in my shoulders i couldn't move my arms. the small was better but was too big in the torso. the material itself was really nice. too bad the fit was so awkward and unflattering.
other Love the design! fabric is very light and flowy. i like a tank underneath for a little extra coverage. runs a little wide. size down. such a fun top, i've had tons of compliments! i usually wear a size 8 and i purchased a medium but wish that i had sized down to a small.
other I bought these in white (not a harsh white, more soft-looking), and am very pleased with them. they are true to the manufacturer's sizing (i own another pair of pants from elevenses in the same size), which runs somewhat large (i'm 5' 5" tall, weigh 13other pounds, and the size 6 fit perfectly). the back of the waistband is elasticized, so there's some give. they're long enough on me that they hit the floor; with heels, they're perfect. they look as pictured, but what you can't tell from the photo i
other I loved this top. i paired it with he ag stevie short and jasper and jeera beaded sandals. look was super cute and casual. i love the fact you can adjust the fit in the back with the lace up detailing. flowly tank without the maternity look. i went with the lavender color and it looks great with my olive skin. i had no problem with sheerness when wearing a nude bra. for reference i am 5'6'' 13other lbs and went with the small.
other The colors and design are stunning in person. it is one-size and as most kimonos go it is billowy and flowing, and not fitted. i plan to wear it with a pair of black shorts and also with black leggings. i love the idea of layering this over shorts. i have a similar kimono and wear it as a bating suit cover-up. the long kimono over short looks fresh and modern and gives you the option to have some coverage when you want it. also, really pops over simple black leggings and black top. it's light an
other I bought this dress for my sister's bridal shower, and it was a hit! i was a little bit surprised when it arrived because i did think it was going to be actual tweed - it is not. it is simply a tweed pattern! i think it makes a little bit more casual, but it was a fun dress for an afternoon bridal brunch! one thing i wish it had - pockets!!
3 I love boiled wool and have gotten a few items from retailer in years past that i have loved. this one was a fail. i typically wear a small and it was slightly too big and shapeless for me. i am 34c, 127#. the moment i put it on, it felt like i was wearing a bathrobe. it flares quite a bit, and the stitching is brown and not dark grey like i was hoping. the quality is as expected. the color overall is as it looks online. but it was a return.
other I ordered this dress in the blood orange and have a few complaints. while it appears to be made with quality, it runs really large. also, in the picture the fabric appears to have a sheen and be somewhat dressy. the actual fabric is just flat cotton. it's a very casual dress, not as dressy as pictured. it's also quite shapeless on. i'm returning it.
other Very flattering, not too short, beautiful. i'm 5.6, 36d, usually wear m in dresses, wide hips. the 8 fit very nicely.
other This top! it is so simple, but so great at the same time! it does run large, and i'm not a skinny girl... but it has a style that is certainly meant to flow away from the body as it goes down. i find the top portion very flattering and the looser bottom section doesn't take away from that. i have been wearing the olive green with fitting dark jeans and a flannel or oversized soft, washed-jean button down shirt over it for the cool spring weather. it's casual, but so comfy. it's great for loungin
other I bought this shirt in white, i have worn it other ways so far and love it. i wore it under a pull over and had the tail ends stick out and it was great that way, and i wore it with a long cardigan. i received a lot of compliments on it. i will be buying it in red!!
other I love the pattern and colors of this dress. the quality of the fabric is great. i initially ordered my usual size xs, but found it a bit roomy so i ordered both an xsp and an xxs. the xxs was more fitted and the xsp was too short in my opinion. i am still on the fence about the xs and the xxs. the xxs has a tighter fit, but it is also tight in the bust and i wonder how it will be if i have to reach for something - will it be too tight? even though the xs runs slightly big, i can still work with
other I love these pants! i got the blue ones. i got a petite 2other and i am 115lbs 5.1.5' - they sit low on waste and hug curves just right. they are little bit long, maybe other inch too long. will wear with platform or thick squared heel.
other There's a stretch and a swing to the dress that makes you feel light and free. really sexy as pictured with boots and scarf
other Loved the flared style of this cardigan. i first choose the yellow and returned it for the navy. the knit pointelle design is interesting and the cardi is so soft. have used it many times already - always makes me feel great.
3 I loved this dress...until i washed it. the label says machine wash cold and lay flat to dry...which i did (washed on delicate). now it's not the same dress. it's too short and not as soft and i feel so much differently about it. i wish the label would just instruct to dry clean, i would pay the extra expense to still have the dress i loved. just kind of annoyed. so it's an awesome dress, just be prepared to dry clean it or risk shrinkage if you wash it.
other This is one of those stunning retailer pieces that keep us coming back for more. it reminds me of the lithe dresses from the earlier retailer days. it fits tts. well made with side zipper that zips both the inner sheath and outer tulle overlay ( as opposed to those obnoxious linings that you wrestle with). the inner sheath has a fabulous lattice work pattern while the overlay has beading and embroidered detail.  sure to sell out.
other Loved the material and the style. unfortunately, my fears came true when i received this swimsuit, and there wasn't enough support despite a review i had read. as a 36d, i thought the halter would be enough support, however, the material is too stretchy to rely on that completely. i am sad i won't be keeping this though. the material is heavenly!!!
other I purchased this dress in the store and then realized i could get a petite size. i ordered it in a pm but had to return it. i reordered it in ps and it's perfect. i love it for a casual evening out of wearing around town in the summer. it's supper figure flattering.
other I tried on a size 8 in the store just for fun... (i am a 0 petite) and then decided to take a chance and order my usual size. i was a little worried as many reviews said the dress was small, but it was on back order and decided to wait before ordering a size up. the 0p was actually fine, yes, it is a little hard to zip up, but once on, it is totally fine... not even too snug... but i didn't sit and eat... we shall see. i don't plan on ordering the size up. i think the zipper needed some wiggling
other It is so cute in the picture but wasn't flattering on me. it also felt like i couldn't raise my arms while wearing it. i love retailer and will be a forever fan, but this dress just wasn't for me.
other The pants are pretty and run true to size, but the fabric is bathing suit like, very thin and sheers in the butt when you squat. i wouldn't recommend for anything but waking.
other This is not your basic white tee. the ruffle and seam down the front add visual interest. cute alone or paired with a sweater and statement necklace.
other Can't say enough about this cute dress....i bought it in red/ which is more of a burgundy, and paired it with a pair of over the knee burgundy boots. i can see wearing this in the spring, summer; heck, all year round! quality is nice and the gold zipper down the top of the back is a classy touch. don't pass this one up!
other I wanted to love this but my hips interfered. it is a little on the short side also as one previous reviewer noted and is definitely made for a straight figure. beautiful details on the shoulder and could definitely see this as a staple in my closet if the fit was right. sadly it was returned!
other This dress is super soft and really flattering. i'm 5'2" and i tried a regular size m in the store and hated it on me, but decided to order a petite m and give it a try and i love it. it's one i've been wearing a lot with ankle boots and all sorts of jackets. it's great for these fall days that are still warm-ish. would be really cute with tights.
other This sweater was exactly what i was hoping for. it is true to size. it actually is cozy, which i love in the winter. the color is so pretty. the quality is good. it is fun and stylish. i do recommend it.
other I was really nervous when ordering this dress because of the other reviews, but i couldn't get to a store during the mother's day event and really wanted this little number. it arrived yesterday and i'm already so excited to wear it, especially once i get just a tiny bit of a tan. i love the fact that it is yellow and white stripes with the dragonflies on top--the pattern is so much cuter in person than it appears online. the fabric is also a good weight, and it is lined, which greatly simplifie
other I purchased this in london, early april, and i wore it to a summer wedding. it was perfect and hangs very nicely. the colors are rich and the deep blue flowers have texture. the front slit goes up to about the knee but doesn't split apart when walking which i appreciated. the only thing that i felt was a little off was the circumference of the sleeves. i have to keep them unbuttoned but thankfully it looks like just an interesting detail and not so much like an unbuttoned sleeve. a definite keep
3 Beautiful fabric and beautifully made, but the pockets ruin it... and i love pockets. you cannot see from the photos, but they protrude from the sides a few inches beyond the skirt, and look strange and unflattering, especially from the back. they are unfortunately placed right below the hips, and the effect is like those french bicycle baskets, "panniers." if they were smaller and in the front, the dress would work. i am usually a size other and both the other and the other fit me well ? not too snug or to
other Wasn't sure whether i would like the top from the online picture, but it is so much more flattering in person. can be worn as a casual piece with denim skinnys or dressed up with a pencil skirt.
other I absolutely fell in love with this dress in the store and immediately scooped it up in black. wore it 3-other times on hot summer days and it was perfect! very comfortable, easy to throw on and dress up or down. i decided to hand wash instead of dry cleaning (as i usually do) and after hanging dry, it became significantly more translucent than it had been before! i can no longer wear this dress because you can see everything through it. it's as though the fabric completely changed after being wet.
other Cute sweatshirt with fun print. i bought it using retailer discount, and probably would not have paid full price for it. embroidery is a nice touch. i ordered an xs, which fits fine, but the overall design of the shirt is a little short and boxy. i did not realize until it arrived that the back of the shirt is a v neck. it's not a deep v, but it feels a little odd at first.
other Soft and stylish - my usual large seems a bit too large, so i will try a medium.
3 This dress has so much potential but doesn't make it.i read all the reviews and very few were favorable and still took my chances. fabric color and textures is great but the design is really off.with the little folds on the shoulder and since the fabric is more on the thick side, all this make it to accumulate the "extra" weight on the front of the body and as result "not flattering" for the majority of ladies including meit is a shame since it has may great features, the style: flowy, low
other Cozy and nice quality. great fit and runs true to size. could wear this every day
other Fit was very tts.  it looks more lightweight in the photo than it is in person, it's a fairly medium weight sweater.  i'm 5'8 and curvy, and it is nowhere near as long on me in the front as it is on the model.  i still liked the look, mostly because of the look from the back of the shirt.
other This is a great piece, you can do many things with it. i wore it to work and church :)
other I can't say enough good things about this piece. high quality in structure and design. when i initially put it on i worried that i might have ordered a size too small. so i was pleasantly surprised to realize this dress fits like a glove but has enough give in all of the right places to let you eat, dance, breath, etc. i received tons of compliments.of note, i am 128 lbs and 5/other - i wore a size 4.wanting another event that i can wear this to as i wore it to a work xmas party.
other Got this today and am really pleased. beautiful detail and i love how the cowl neck hangs. it's not itchy at all. overall, a great find for the colder months ahead. i got a small and probably should have ordered xs  instead. runs a little big on my petite frame.
3 I am other 8", 130 and i usually wear a other in tops like this from retailer but the fit of this one was not good for me. though the styling and details of the top are lovely, it was small through the shoulders and very large everywhere else. looked too much like maternity. i love the shape of this kind of top but to be flattering it actually needs to be fitted through the bust and upper body and then flare in the right places and this was pretty boxy all around. too bad - so cute!
other Love these pajama bottoms. they are so comfortable and the print is fun and unique. i highly recommend. they run true to size and have a great length. they look short on the model but mine are perfect.
other I just received this dress and i'm glad i read previous reviews and ordered a size up. i normally wear an xs or s and ordered a medium it fits perfectly. the color is beautiful and the dress is unique. can't wait to find a special event to wear it.
other This sweater was pretty short. beyond that, when i raised my arms, the thickness of the sweater caused the shoulders to rise up and stay there when i put my arms down.
other I love these pants, they are soft versatile and stylish! great choice!
other This dress is beautiful. it is even prettier in person than in pictures... i was pleasantly surprised when it came in the mail! i am 5'2, 12other lbs and went with a 4p, and it fit perfectly. (i typically do not like things to be extremely clingy). this could easily be dressed up or down. personally, i wore it to a wedding, and received many compliments on its uniqueness.
other This is a beautiful dress. fits true to size. very flowy and comfortable. the color looks just like the pic.
3 This silk skirt was not the best look for me, but may work for others. i purchased the med, which fit fine. i just wasn't in love with the print/colors. the skirt has quality material and is well made. it's very light and airy. i did return it.
other The length is perfect. the cut of the hemline makes it off the charts cute. i love it w ghillie type flats or booties. pair w a big warm sweater, or a sleek turtleneck, and watch heads turn as you enter the room! i promise! love this skirt.
other These are *almost* perfect. the fabric feels great, and it's a super cute print. the only downside is that the rise is really long and high. i wish they'd stocked more petities, because the petites are all sold out, and only the super long regulars are left at this time. if you are above 5'7", they'll be awesome on you. if you are below 5'4", you may be getting them altered.
other I am so happy with this chemise! the pink is the most breathtaking blush and the fabric is super soft. i like that the straps are adjustable, allowing me to make the bodice a perfect fit while adjusting the gown to the perfect length for me. it's definitely my new favorite!
other I can't stop wearing this. it's perfect for layering! the fit is great-loose but not a bag. i love that it's a wide open knit.
other For me, this looked better in the picture. i found the actual item more garish in person, and way too scratchy (on the outside) for my liking. hard pass for this petite.
other Love this skirt, beautiful fabric and lined. looks great with a tailored jean jacket by pilcro or the window pain patterned retailer cartonnier jacket. i chose the size 8 though a little snug in the waist it fit better than the size 10. i am 150 lbs and 5'other inches and curvy with small waist but curvy hips with a tush so this cut is perfect for my shape. i love the asymmetrical design with how the skirt will partial zip and the fabric attachment underneath with hidden button. love the edgy look. so
other This is a great long sleeve, casual shirt for spring - soft and airy. pairs well with jeans. i found that it fit me just right. i'm not very tall, but my shoulders are a little broad for my height, which typically puts me in the "small/medium" range, so i got size 6 regular. this hits just below the hip and the shoulders are spot on. very flattering yolk that gives a little contour to the bust. gauzy fabric has wrinkled texture which gives it a casual look and feel. my only problem is there aren
other Eyelash sweaters are all so soft and cuddly but this is the only one i've found what doesn't make me look like a bear. the shoulder cut-outs really help create a   flattering silhouette. i'm 36-30-40 the medium fits well, slightly loose so the sleeve below the cut out hangs slightly. highly recommend.
3 The fabric and style on this swing tee are really nice but be aware it runs really, really large. i downsized on my order because of the style but it wasn't enough. like wearing a tent. i would recommend it but know its very full. i did return it.
other This is a super comfy and adorable shirt. got the black motif - it could def. be passed off as a dark/inkish navy color, too, so it's very versatile. it runs typical/tts for maeve (if you're unfamiliar with the brand, order up one or two sizes if you have broad shoulders and/or large arms). this is super lightweight; feels "slinky" for lack of a better word. essentially, it's rayon-gauze- but it is double-layered, so it is not sheer at all (no need for a cami, although in the lighter version i c
other Really cute skirt. found it to be too much material on my frame - 5'4. would look really great on someone taller. the tie in the front was pretty, but a bit bulky on me and ultimately i want a skirt i can wear both ways - with shirts tucked in or out. this one is tuck in only so sending back. will look really great on someone else though! nice knee length skirt.
other This dress was a disappointment. not black, but brown. and it was very oddly made, with a weird, seam right across the belly. on its way back...
other I almost walked past this until i saw it on the display mannequin. the shimmer is very subtle, but there, the picture here makes hte shirt look more like a grey shirt, but it is more "sophisticated" in person. very soft fabric, fitted on the "wasit", but romier on top, cowl is super flattering. usual sizze fit very nicely. highly recommend, i won't hev to tuck it in everytime i wear it :-# i think it can be dressed up #skirt# or down #jeans#, almost a basic t!
other Like the other reviewer said this top is extremely wide and boxy. it must be pinned in the picture online. it's very frustrating when they do that. thank goodness i didn't pay for shipping! for reference, i'm 5'other and 13other pounds and bought the xxs, it's going back for sure. i'm trying to lose baby weight, not trying to look pregnant!
other Absolutely gorgeous skirt! so feminine and curve hugging. wish i hadn't found this so late! want it in every imaginable color, but i will settle for the off white.please bring this style back!
other This beauty arrived in my store today...and despite all my gals telling me that i own too many vests, i just had to have this one. i've always wanted a cozy fur or sherpa vest...but i'm curvy and always feel like those add bulk. this one only has sherpa on one side (the softest most cozy sherpa ever) and its not too bulky! the print is even better than it appears online...in fact, the vest almost appears pink online, and its not in person. there is much more variation in color in person! i adore
other Love the fit of pilcro jeans. it's always a struggle to find a white jean that is flattering around the thighs and doesn't show off lumps and bumps! these are terrific quality indeed.
other This top is exactly as pictured and the fit is perfect. the knit is a nice quality and the embroidery is striking. i can't wait to wear it. it will look great with skinny jeans.
other Love the length and long sleeves. so comfy to sleep in! great purchase, i ordered the navy one too!!
3 I need t-shirts, these seem cute. a small runs loose, but it's comfortable and it does fit. i am turned off by the little side slits on all of this brand's printed tees. if i want to do a partial tuck to give myself a waist, because these shirts are cut generously, the little slits just throw the whole look off. i tried a few in the store, but left them all there.
other This vest is beautiful and exactly as shown in the model shot. it is soft, warm, and drapes beautifully...perfect length on my 5'7" frame. the leather detail along the edge is a nice high-quality touch. i will say that it is pretty itchy especially around the neck, but wearing a shirt with a collar like it is shown seems to help that issue. the dark color is navy in the print (not black)...overall i think this is gorgeous, but the full price feels a little ludicrous...i think i may wait until sa
other This is my new favorite dress! my only complaint is the slip is too small and the dress cannot be worn without it. i can't order a size up as the dress would then be huge. not sure what the solution is but the dress itself is stunning.
other This is a steal at the sale price. medium is large on me and i'm generally a large at retailer. so soft.
other Another beautiful retailer top.  i ordered a small (5.4, 11other lbs, broad shoulders, athletic build) and it looked really large when i pulled it out of the package.  it's a bit large, but i wouldn't want it tighter through the bust (34c).  the colors are vibrant and the print is really beautiful.  although it can be hand-washed, i will be taking this to the cleaners to preserve the color! i love retailer because their clothing is so often  unique.
other Loved this online, but the xs was too big and the material was too bulky.
other I absolutely love this skirt! i purchased both a medium and a large. i found that it ran big. i typically wear a size 10-12. i ended up keeping the medium and it was perfect!
other Based on other reviews i was hesitant to order, but i loved the colors and design in the blouse. it was on major sale so i took a chance and could not be more pleased. it is very sheer as other reviewers have noted so i was expecting that. i wear a cami under nearly everything so no problem for me. the colors are tdf and i can wear well into fall down here in south ms. there were a few strands of thread hanging from various seams but i gently clipped with scissors. if you are attracted to the to
other Really interesting, beautiful colors. i found it to be short, even in the regular size (and i'm 5'other with a short torso). wish the fit was slimmer, but i could see it working with jeans, or being stunning with a black ball skirt.
other Love these pants. they look great with a pair of mid calf boots and a loose t-shirt. i usually wear a size 26 or 27 but went with a 27 on these. they are very flattering and edgy. love them!
other This fits tts.  it is body-hugging as shown on the model.  the knit is thin, soft with tons of stretch.  i bought the "navy" which is the color shown in the photo.  as you can see, it's not really navy.  it's a strange blue that's more like a faded dark mallard blue.  but, it's still blue.the sleeves are long on me. so you taller girls won't have issues.  the ruffles move and are so fun.  the fabric, however, is not finished off.  it's raw cut material, which is why i gave it other stars.
other I was looking for a stylish spring/fall jacket and this one seemed to fit the bill. i was shocked by the quality and softness of the material and construction of this jacket. i could honestly not believe how comfortable and cute this felt and looked on me. i can't wear it enough! i am a short 5'2" but 36d and have 31" waist so i ordered a size m and l to see which would work best. as it turned out the m fit with plenty of room! i am normally a 12/1other so i was surprised by this. if you are on the
other Cute and very soft, but the elastic wasn't sewn in right. i took them out of the wash and the waistband was a twisted mess. disappointing for more expensive loungewear.
other Make sure to get the whole outfit. the skirt sits high enough so that it avoids the muffin look.
other This skirt fits my curves so well. the adjustable waist is so helpful for getting the perfect fit. it sits high on me, but i have a very long torso so that didn't bother me and actually made the length more flattering for my shorter legs. the colors are vibrant and versatile.
other This top is absolutely gorgeous in person. i am usually a size 1other in everything..pants and tops but this one i ended up getting a size 10. definitely size down otherwise the top will slide back on you and the arm holes will be crazy big. but it's a great top for summer. very cool and light. and the v-neck back and front is just so pretty. great buy!
other Cute enough, but i couldn't figure out what to do with the tie that didn't make it look like an extra set of sleeves, oddly placed.
other I tried this on in the store and immediately loved it!  it is "diaphanous," but that is the intended look.  the dress is meant to be a cool, breezy, cover-up.  the design would have been slightly improved with slight tapering at the waist and sleeves, but not everyone can carry a fuller dress to begin with.  anyway, i purchased so many things that day that i had to narrow my picks down a bit.  i left this dress behind, but kept thinking about how very pretty it was.  when retailer offered an addit
other You want to buy this! it's so comfy and stylish, yet casual. the sale price is amazing. if anything, the arms of the coat are a bit thin compared to the body of the coat. overall, it fits well though. i ordered an xs. i almost want to order the other color i love it so much. i will probably wear this year round but it will be especially cute in autumn!
other Very comfortable and attractive pullover. not too long or bulky, although i find myself rolling the sleeves up to keep them out of the way!but it's a keeper
other This is all around, a pretty feminine take on the white shirt- very cute! the dot pattern adds some drama without it being too over-board. this fit of this top is fairly generous (on me at least), but it doesn't have a lot of stretch. i could probably be either a s or xs, but took the xs to get more of a silhouette.
other I am 5'8", 140lbs, pear-shaped. i ordered the s and it fit perfectly, just skimming the floor. the material is a beautiful gauzy metallic material that is lightweight with a beautiful drape and wonderful sorbet-inspired colors. the waistband is elasticized but not elastic, and there is no unflattering poofing, which can happen with skirts like this. the flaw, however, is in the decision to only half-line this skirt with an off-white jersey material. the half-lining isn't horrible but i found it
other Saw these in the store and had to have them. i wear them rolled up. they are lightweight. whenever i wear them i want to smile. the birds with hats are so funny. i wear them to run errands, have worn them when flying, etc. can't say enough good things about these pants. they wash well, no ironing needed.
other I already knew that it's not the lightest summer dress by reading previous reviews.yes, it is fully lined with stretchy fabric which is kind of thick and heavy for skinny straps. i still love this dress it's very beautiful and versatile. it's perfect for san francisco summer it never gets too hot anyway. the color is also beautiful but it's little pink side of red.i am 5'other size 0 it fits perfect just like the picture.
other Lovely color and really nice fabric. not much form to the dress but will be lovely with a belt or jacket.
3 I tried this on in the store in the xs size. the pattern is striking and really makes you think of all the things you love about fall. having said that i did not buy it and probably won't unless i find it on the sale rack later. it is really more of a poncho than a sweater. the fit is very oversize through the body and i tried the xs size. it is also fairly cropped on me as i am tall. i would only wear it with a shirt underneath. the sleeves and not attached to the shoulder, but start further do
other I love retailer sweaters, in fact, i believe all my sweaters are from retailer! this cardigan is really nice and i'm so glad i bought it. it will work well with skirts, dresses, pants... it's well made and soft and comfy. highly recommended!
other Purchased this in the burnt orange color - very nice!will be lightweight for our hot, humid summers but has a bit of pizazz with the lace up front.the slip is nicely made with strap attachments in the shoulders so they do not slip.i wear a ton of dresses in the summer so this will definitely be a go to item for all the horse races we attend. looking forward to snagging a nice derby style hat to match!
other This cut and shape of this skirt is very flattering. i am normally a medium but the small fit and looked much better- less bulky. the material is nice almost sweater like but not so heavy. it's a very versatile skirt. highly recommend.
other I ordered the top from a store to have it shipped. it is very pretty but once on, it fit the wrong way. i got a small because i know that this designer tends to run tight across the bust. the shoulder was too rounded for this neck line. sleeves should have been either longer or sleeveless. the empire waist even on a smaller busted woman like myself was cut too high.
other I ordered the sweater in a medium but it was too large - so reordered it in the small and it fits perfectly. love the length- it hits mid hip. it is more of an a-line than straight as show in the picture. the detail is fun and the sweater is well made. highly recommend it- i have received lots of compliments on this sweater.
3 I have a few pairs of the stevie ankle, so i thought i try these. they have very little stretch and feel tight in the waist. the distressing near the front pockets is really apparent...like white stripes. they make the jean look overall cheap. not worth $198, in my opinion.
other Rompers are usually tough for me. i am petite, especially on top (5'2", 110 lbs, 34a), but have a healthy butt and hips, which can make sizing difficult. in this romper, i tried a regular xs, and found the fit very flattering. the top was blouse-y on me, but not overly so, and the arm holes didn't gape, which is usually an issue for me with non-petite sizing. the elastic waistband is also great, as you can adjust it to hit you in a flattering spot and keep the shorts from being too short (which
other I wanted to love this dress but sadly returned it.  i think it would be more appropriate for someone younger.  it runs very large but its not clingy so forgiving of anyone with chunkiness (such as myself).  i guess i just thought the blue was a little too unexciting (for me).
other Saturday/sunday never disappoints! love this black cardigan. runs a tad large i noticed in the arm length for me. not a problem anywhere else though. good medium weight to the fabric. durable quality and waist flattering once tied. great for throwing on over a dress, wearing with a t-shirt
other I ordered the taupe version of this tee, which was a medium brown with black stripes. the fabric felt itchy and rough, and was pretty sheer for not being light colored. i didn't care for the fit, which was extremely boxy and wide; from the picture, i expected an a-line fit, but not a wide drop with webbed underarms. i ordered other sizes, and could have worn the smaller if i'd kept this tee. it runs on the larger side. what astounded me most was that both tees i ordered were sewn with completely cro
other Love embroidery!
other I tried this on, the fit was true to size, as far as no cup size goes (32dd, got xs, was ok). the pattern i like, and was totally fine on my pale skin, but think of it, i would not likely wear this without a tank or shirt... support seemed ok too, i do like the criss-cross detail in the abck. thinking about keeping it, but i jsut don't "need" it right this second... dilemma.caveat: not been tested in a workout, obviously, since i am not sure i will keep it (may chance it on sale).
other This is a lovely sweater--unique, nicely made, though i found that it ran large for me. i was between a size xs and small, and neither one seemed just right so i ended up returning it. the small had the right length in the arms and torso, but was too wide in the torso and shoulders, and the xs was too short. bummer! also found that every single ivory one had stains or spots on them in my local store, not sure why. if i had been able to settle on the right size i probably would've kept it!
other I've been looking for the perfect white eyelet maxi, feels like a perfect summer staple...but sadly this was not it. quality isn't great which is surprise on a $168 price tag. top of dress is lined but cheaply so it's somewhat see through. the dress was returned.
other This is a beautiful sweater with deep rich colors. i purchased the blue motif. the problem is that the model(s) are small busted, which allows the side panels and front panel to lay nicely and swing in a flattering manner. i am 5'6'', 13other pounds and a 36d. i usually wear a small in antro tops. i purchased this online, and was excited upon it's arrival. when i tried it on, i was horrified. it looked like a babydoll maternity sweater on me. the front did not lay well (flat) at all from the chest d
other This dress is very versatile and flattering on-- i've already worn it out to casual cocktails with friends twice since i've gotten it. i'm 5'3 and 12other lbs and the other petite worked perfectly on me.
other I love everything about this dress, but the bust area. the bottom is so light and flowey with the pleating. makes you want to twirl. the color is light but not as light as the photo. it does not wash me out. the problem is the bust. it has pleats that billow out near the armpit area, making you look top heavy. the bottom is slimming, the top make you look buxom. the v neck is also higher than i would like, which again adds to the fullness of the chest area. i am still debating keeping this or re
other I really love these pants. just the right fabric, not too thick. so comfy. i do feel they run a bit big. they stretch out quickly so if you are in between sized, choose the smaller one.
other Love this little "throw on and feel comfortable all day" tee shirt
other Perfect denim top! the fabric/material is great and of good quality. there is a structure to the top, but it really makes the looks. the quality is amazing and the top can be styled in so many ways. for the quality, a definite must buy!
3 These are absolutely beautiful pants. soft and wearable right away, but the other reviewer is right. if you are average or short, these will be way too long. they won't even look like cropped pants, just regular wide leg jeans. i am keeping them b/c i love the look and i will also have them altered to be shorter. it's disappointing that these were designed for the statuesque instead of the other 90% of us, especially considering the amazingly high price for a pair of jeans. so... i guess i am di
other I ordered the petite size 27 and the fit is just like on the model...not tight at all and very flattering. even the petite length is long on me and i will need to wear wedges or something with a heel but honestly that makes them even more flattering...makes my legs look long! i am 5'4" and about 118#. the material is so soft and substantial...the color is very accurately portrayed online. i can't wait to wear this fall!
other It's thin, very. but i were a cute scrappy athletic type bra underneath and it's so cute!it's a stink top, i pick a spot to tuck in around the from and let the rest flow.aside from being a swing top, it runs large. i have other in xs and i'm a 34dd and i still have room.i have it in faded red/pink and white and am buying blue too, love it!
other This is very practical. it goes with many things and is very comfortable....it can be worn with different leggings or with jeans! and it is well made! thanks retailer!
other I love the layered look of this jacket. i got it in navy which matches everything. i think it's a little on the large side for me. i ordered a small. i'm 5'2" 130 lbs. super comfortable. the inner layer is very soft. once you wash it, the outside is soft too. i've already worn mine several times. happy.
other I pretty much love any sweater by moth. this one is no exception. soft, lofty, and a pretty shade (i bought in pink), this will be a cold weather staple.
other I've been on the lookout for a great quality basic black and white stripe shirt. it's easy to find the super cheap ones that last you maybe four wears. this one is great quality, extremely soft, and comfortable. i'm usually a small in tops, but got this in a medium so that it would fit like the model, slightly loose, i didn't want it body hugging. so, if you're looking for that fit, go up a size, it doesn't stretch out much.
other I initially bought this in the stone color and loved it so much the first time i wore it that i went back for the red. without a doubt my favorite purchases of the season. have gotten so many compliments on both and despite the fact that the style isn't form fitting, it is still somehow very flattering. would highly recommend this sweater to anyone!
other This is a beautiful dress! i love the patterns, the beading and the texture. however, i have returned it (size medium - my usual size) and asked for an exchange up to a large (fingers crossed it will be available!) because the shoulders are very narrow. i am fairly tall (5'8") with an athletic build. the body fit was a bit tighter than i expected also but not really an issue. however, the shoulders were obviously tight making it look too small and uncomfortable. yikes! i sooooo love this dress a
other I bought this dress in green and i really like it. the bodice is a substantial knit - light enough for summer but thicker and sturdier than the typical jersey tee - and the skirt is a lightweight woven fabric with good drape. true to size and extremely comfortable. it's a great work dress. the striped colorblocking is not very flattering on my frame (broad shoulders, larger chest) but it's not bad. you'll probably want to try it on in person.
other I was a bit unsure when ordering because of the cut of this blouse. i have a lean athletic torso but i am a 32dd. sometimes tops like this can make me look heavy or pregnant. love the fit though. it fits lovely and comfy. it goes well with jeans or cream colored pants and will be a nice addition to my spring wardrobe.
other I'm 5'2.5" and petite and had originally ordered s but decide that it was a bit large for me so i returned it and ordered the xs and it fit like a glove with breathing space. i love the conservative style. i can easily move around in it when i'm in the water with my baby. i don't have a large chest but i imagine this would great for big busted girls. it's lightly padded around the bust area. the skirt detail is very cute and the print is unique. i've already gotten compliments on it.
other Love, love this clever eyeglass print. i bought the black background with bright sunglass print - perfect for pairing with jeans, shorts or a slender skirt.
other It's a beautiful top but not for bigger busts. ordered an xl and the top part would not button. i recommend for those with smaller busts.
other I ordered this in both an extra small and a small... i found that there was a very big difference in the two sizes- the extra small was true to size and had a great width, but was shorter in length than i would've liked (if it shrunk at all, it would've been unwearable). the small was quite a jump in size and was a little wider than i liked, but i decided to keep that one. the top was very cute and comfortable when i wore it, however i just washed it once on delicate in cold water and when i
other The torso runs a bit long, but this is otherwise a comfortable, and cute dress.
other Love the fit ! perfect for accomplishing the "dressy jean" look. i always take the same size in pilcro and this is true to size, but not stretchy as in some of the other pilco styles.
other I love this vest-it is a work of art in its design and construction but extremely wearable, absolutely gorgeous on, and perfectly warm and functional. my favorite thing i've ever bought at retailer.
other In both senses, it is pretty and big and pretty big. i ordered the xs as the xxs and xs petite were both out, and it is to big on me. i am usually xs petite or xs, if shorter. i definitely need xxs (petite or not).(11other lbs, 30 dd, 26-27 inch waist)that being said, it is really cute and fun and flirt, but not romantic flirty, just girl next door flirty.the navy and white stripes are classic, so will last over the seasons. the cut is flattering, i really love it, just not on me being that
other If you know one.september and you know what's good for you, then size the heck down. maybe even two sizes if your particularly slim or want the dress to fit tighter. any way, this dress is simply scrumptious! the embroidery at the bodice is so detailed and pretty. the layers are light and soft like silk (but it's rayon/poly) and the sleeves are sheer and voluminous. i actually prefer the sleeves rolled up because they are too long. neckline features a slit-v with two hooks to close if wanted. co
other These pants are so soft and comfortable!! the colors are great too. can't wait to buy more in other colors!
other I was hesitant to buy this, but i'm so glad i did. this is a beautiful poncho. i am petite and usually ponchos overwhelm me, but this fits just right. it is extremely soft, not itchy at all. the color along the bottom of the poncho is actually a bright pink color, it looks a little more red in the photo to me. i'm still happy with this. it will be a wonderful addition to my fall/winter wardrobe. great product!
other Reference: 100#, 5'1, 32a... ordered size xs.  the suit is pretty.  under the neckline, where the two orange panels meet the white center panel, that corner puckers a bit.  this will not happen if you have a larger chest than my 32a or have a longer/broader torso so that the fabric can stretch out, thus pulling that merging area flat.  the sides (cut out) lays flat when you stand up straight and gapes when your turn/bend to the side.  i think this is expected.  the bottom section, on the back, c
other I tried these on in my local store and immediately loved them! they are so flattering on my hourglass shape. the flare leg balances out the hips. great quality and very comfortable. i know i will get so much wear out of these. i bought a size up from my usual size and they fit perfectly.
other This layered top fits true to size. the style is trendy and cute. the type of fabric is nice. i love the design of the back. i would definitely recommend it. it's worth the money.
other Love the shirt and style. shirt looks better in person than online picture. i would get a size down because it runs a little big.
other This is the one. the faux fur i have been looking for. it is plush and heavy so that it should keep me warm and toasty during the dreaded new england winter. i love the richly saturated jewel tones over a base of black . there are only two snaps to close the front but there is enough fabric to overlap to keep the cold away. maybe winter won't be so bad after all....one caveat is that the item description is not truly accurate.i initially ordered a petite since the length stated was almost 37 i
other Material is strange. triangle top is funky. this is just not awesome in any way.
other Love this swing dress. i purchased it for work. it is light and comfy. i wear it with tights and boots. i even purchased it in another color.
other The pics online for this dress are horrible in comparison how stunning this dress is in person.just received it and far exceeded my wildest expectations!it is elegant, classy, and an understated sexy!the colors are rich and vibrant.......gorgeous shades of plum and blue....a unique color combination that is gorgeous!the open mess dress with the solid under layer is a wow!beautiful and flattering fit.it is a 10 !!!!i ordered my usual size and i would say it is true to size, but slig
3 This is absolutely huge.  it felt like it was at least other sizes too big - the empire waist wasn't even semi- fit.  36d chest and size small was like a tent.  however, the embroidery was beautiful
other As others stated, it was a tad bizarre to have a mock neck on the spring dress, however, i would wear this in the fall with boots and a nice moto jacket. another "but" is i wasn't sure about the color. i am very pale and the pale color is pretty much my skin color... however, the blue flowers and black lace make up for it as far as colors, and everyone liked it on me. lastly, cut: wow, this was just really nice on, very flattering,. i usually try on regular size in store and order petite, but th
other I added this to a stack of try-ons on my trip to retailer today not expecting to be impressed by this number but was blown away when i tried it on. 148 dollars is a little pricey but didn't hesitate it was so beautiful, i am a 32b and normally wear a size 6 and the small fit perfectly. can't wait to wear it on vacation in new orleans in a couple of weeks!
other Great coastal sweater. color in my opinion is a perfect rendition of coral. the sleeves hit just right for me to wear long or bunch them up. i can see this sweater paired with shorts or skinny jeans.
other I saw these in the store and was smitten. ordered online and have not been disappointed. love the pattern, the feel, and the fit. comfortable, fun and interesting. the regular length ones are definitely full-length on me but not too long. i might have gone with the petite length except that they didn't seem available, but am perfectly happy with the regular length.
other I love this top! i just bought it on sale so the price was great but it would have been totally worth it paying full price! great quality, unique, and great fit. i look forward to wearing it all year!
other Love these funky jeans. they are a little baggy, like boyfriend jeans. i wore them with a linen white tee and wore them dressed up with a silk top and boots for "casual" friday. they are versatile. love these jeans!
other The colors are vivid and perfectly autumnal but the fit is a mess. it was overall too large, the waistline curves up in the front and then falls into small pleats which was maternityish, the waistband was thicker than the dress and sat away from my body and the material was a cheapish poly. had the outer dress been made from the same material as the lining, i would have liked it better. the modesty closure was a plus but the dress was already unraveling when i took it out. #returned
other I tried a size x small on in the store and i am 5'4" 120 lbs. i had trouble getting my head through the dress, and once i did it felt so tight at the neck, as if it was chocking me. the dress color is very nice but the tight neck and odd arm holes were a no. i would not recommend this dress for those reasons.
other Love, love, love this top. i want to wear it every day! not only is it striped, which is super chic, but also, the peplum hits lower so it really accentuates your waistline (in a good way!). plus, its soft, like so many wonderul bordeaux tops are. i wish they had this is solid colors because i'd buy them all. for reference, i bounce between an xs and s at retailer, more along the lines of s...and i got the xs in this and it still has room (5'7, 13other lbs, 34a/b chest).
other So i fell in love with the print without even noticing that it had horses on it until after it arrived! i was sooo excited! but really the length and fit are the best part about this shirt. with my long torso things are generally too short on me. i'm a sucker for spending money on clothes but still i wish retailer could make cute tees for under 40 bucks:/ i say that, yet i'm not sending it back:)
3 This is indeed a very flattering dress and looks great - unless you move in it. the fabric shows every little lump and bump on your body as you move and clings to tights (only a little but just enough to make it annoying). if you have any jiggle at all, i'd steer clear. would have definitely kept it if the fabric were different because the cut is amazing but alas.
other As other reviews noted, this runs large--huge is more like it. it's great quality, but i'm wondering now if the s/m would take me through the third trimester of pregnancy (which is why i ordered a m/l). i'm 5'7", and if i were any less, i don't think this would work for me at all.
other I ordered these in my typical size, 26, and they fit everywhere perfectly except the butt. for me, i found them to be too tight in that area. i went to the store and tried on the 27 and they were too big in the waist. i do recommend them though. they are well made, i loved the wash and the length was perfect. being 5'3" they came to the lower ankle and that was fine with me. give them a try, hopefully they work better for you.
other Loved the look, fit and styling of this turtleneck. but dry clean only, you have to be kidding?
other Love the length, cut, & placement of pockets. the stretch has positive & negative consequences, though. minuses: easily wrinkled, grow other sizes within the day. pluses: comfy, bendy, they're designed to be more of an active short, so the wrinkles & give are quite fine (they only stretch in unnoticeable areas). if we're to repurchase, i'd size down--but i love the bright color  & comfort so much i'm keeping these as is. (i'm a 6-8, should have purchased the 27's.)
other Super cute dress online on the model. what you can't tell from the picture is the slip underneath is not true to size of the dress and the outside layer of the dress is more sheer than the picture shows so you can tell the slip underneath is very tight. it might be my body type. otherwise, it's super cute in person and i wish it would've fit better!
other I love this blouse because it's great for work with cardigan over it, and great for going out with skirt, pants or jeans. it is tts and very flattering, light weight, and comfortable.
other I did the happy dance when the dress arrived, but the very sad dance when i tried it on. unfortunately, instead of following my instincts, i took the review here (and reviews from some other sites) to heart and ordered a size bigger than usual . huge mistake, as in this dress was huge -- much too big to alter and keep the integrity of design. for reference i'm 5'7, 130lbs, 34c. i usually wear an 8 dress (due to a very large rib cage). i ordered the 10 but was literally swimming. i think a 6 woul
other Really adorable and very retro looking.. fits true to size but i got it a size larger because i wanted to tie up the bottom.. have had it 3 days & have worn it twice already!!!
3 I had tried this on in the beige & loved it but could not find it in my size so i got it in the pink.did not look at good as the beige.
other This is a great transition piece. wear with jeans or dress it up with a cute skirt.
other This skirt is worth every penny! it appears slightly different than pictured in terms of color -- it is a cream/blue gray making it very versatile. the crochet work is beautiful and cream. it is not too bright to show every dirt mark; the cream coordinates perfectly with the leather color. it is a classic, elegant design and could be paired with a silk type or even a cashmere sweater in the cooler months to come. for me, it is tts mostly (i am usually a 4-6) and the six fits perfectly. it has an
other The softest tank i own. even though it's a soft burnout fabric it's still not too sheer. great quality
other The linen- cotton blend breathes so well for a hot summer day! the design on the waistline is super cute and yes they are a little long in the leg but that can be a plus+ for vertically challenged girls like me. wedges and platforms are perfect to show off the soft drape of the pant legs. now that they're on sale, i'm snatching up other colors, like white and light khaki- already have the seersucker blue pair!
other I ordered these without reading the previous reviews and i would have to agree with everything everyone has already said. these are the cutest cords i've seen in a long time! they're definitely skinny, bridging on way too skinny through the calves but i'm willing to stick it out. the thing that bugs me about them is how stinking short they are?? the description doesn't really mention that they're crops but at this length any ankle bootie is going to be too short. also, they aren't navy. they're
other I've been hesitant with crushed velvet comeback...but this dress is adorable! first, it is not a tent; on me it's the perfect fit for the style - not too swingy but definitely not fitted. this is the dress you can grab on a day you don't feel like sucking it in, throw a blazer over it if you need you look professional, wear to a girls brunch with booties or a night out with the hubs. the little extra detail i didn't see online that was a pleasant style surprise is the almost strap-looking piece
3 I looked like i was going to work on a farm. well made, but seemed fit big. i like and have owned wide leg pants/capris, these were cartoonishly wide.needless to say, they were returned.
3 I like the colors, material and style of this sweater but not a fan of the sizing.  the xs/s was far too short for me and the m/l was great in length but had a tremendous amount of extra volume.  i am 5'/6" size 8.
3 Cute stripes and soft, but very pajama top like in feel/look... like if you wear it out, people will assume you've got the matching bottoms stuck under your pillow at home.
3 The colors on this top are beautiful, even more vibrant than the online picture. i was so excited to try it on. the problem is with the fitting. it's too short and too loose. you can see in the picture that the shirt isn't even tucked in and it barely hits the hips. as much as i wanted it to work, back it goes.
other I love this dress. i bought it other weeks ago and have already worn it 3 times, each time receiving multiple compliments. it is easy, comfortable and cute. also love that you can tie it in the back or the front. great dress!
other Super flattering cut and the material is like buttah! no seriously, it's like a 10-yr old tee soft! the colors aren't even close compared to online, though. the green is a brighter almost grass green and the pink is more like a salmon color. i didn't see the lilac in the store.
other I run between an xs and s in most retailer shirts. i went with the xs in this one and was glad i did. the fit is lovely and flattering. i loved this shirt the second i put it on -- then went to order it in another color.
other I am 5'3" and 11other lbs. i ordered other on a whim and i'm so happy i did because they're so flattering.
other It's pretty, floaty, feminine; the photos don't do justice to the prettiness. but the photos also don't show an asymmetrical hem. i understood it runs small so i got two sizes, to be safe, and even my larger size was strangely short-waisted, and i'm short-waisted to start with. maybe i could've lived with that, but both the dresses i received have an uneven hem unlike any i've ever worn or seen before. it's not longer on just the sides; the hem is longer in one spot on the front, and one in the
other If you like a slightly heavier, non/clingy basic tee, this is it. i wore the long sleeved version all fall and winter, rotating colors, and i've been wearing these with shorts and leggings since i got them. the colors are great, fabric is quality, and the ribbon detail in the back gives these a little flare.
other This dress embodies the retailer brand. the design is unique, and form fitting for just about any body type. beautiful saturated colors and a great cut make it an all around classic. i wish for more of these designs. i originally ordered my usual size 4, but went down to a 2. this dress runs large. looks great with heels or boots as pictured. i am 5'6" 13other lb. this dress has a timeless quality that you will wear for years to come. at my age, i try to buy things that i will wear for many sea
other I love this off the shoulder top. it is so flattering  and the  colors are gorgeous. i normally wear a small or medium in retailer tops, i am wearing an extra small in this one, and it fits great. i am only other 1" tall so the length hits me perfectly.
other I love the elbow patches on this shirt. i ordered the wine color, and it's dark enough to almost be a neutral. i've worn it with many things already. my only complaint is that the sleeves are super long. typically, long sleeved shirts are too short for me, so i'm guessing this one would be ridiculously long on someone with short arms.
other Fits like a glove and looks amazing on. it fits so many different body types but yet is flattering in all the right places! i got 00p and have a smaller chest and hip but it really gives a nice shape! got compliments all night when i wore this to a formal dance, but i could see myself wearing this again and again for holiday parties or other occasions!
other I tried on the petite size in my usual xs, adn i actually have to go down to xxs, i looked overtaken by the shirt. i'm 5'2" and 115lbs)cut is flowy and not close to the body, sleeves are narrower, but still ok with athletic built.color: light one is great for gals with darker complexion and hair, but for my pale self, the darker one was better... but can't go wrong, i ordered both colors and liked both of them.ruffle is a great addition too...
other This is a beautiful piece that looks even better in person - a nice mix of modern and artistic, with just enough color and a flattering fit. my only concern is that it may get itchy throughout the day, especially at the neckline. if you can handle a little wool blend next to your skin, i would recommend it for style and fit.
other Love these! they are thick and comfortable. they feel like sweat pants but are cute enough to wear out if you are running quick errands. definitely recommend!
other After a few months of coveting, i received this jumpsuit as a gift (apparently my longing wasn't too subtle!) and was delighted to find it didn't disappoint at all! the material has a nice weight and falls away from the body, but still is very swingy and light. it is great for our slightly chilly spring, yet i expect it will be fantastic as the weather warms up. i am 5'6" and usually a 26" or size other in bottoms and an xs or s on top. i got this jumpsuit in an xs and it fits very loosely (much lik
other Have to disagree with previous posters. i found just one of these on the sale rack in my local retailer (someone returned it from online) and it was adorable on. got many compliments in the dressing room area. other customers asked if there were more available but it's turns out it's an online exclusive. it does have a zipper. i recommend sizing up not because it runs small (i think it's pretty true to size) but i think it looks better a bit loose/drapery. fabric is soft and pretty. tailoring is f
other Really liked the color but the style was too cropped and boxy for me. this sweater was short, wide and unflattering. however, i like this designer so i ordered another style with a different silhouette.
3 I carefully read the reviews and decided to order a medium since that size works for me generally with floaty styles. the neck was a bit small but once over my head it fit and looked nice. the deal breaker for me is the huge droopy armholes that showed half my bra. the colors are deeper than shown. but the pattern and length overwhelmed my shape feeling a lot like a maternity top. i liked that the sides are shorter but overall it's just not my style. better suited i think for taller, slimmer bod
other This dress is quite lovely in person, but it runs very small, particularly in the bust. i'm usually okay with a large in retailer dresses (sometimes medium), but i had a hard time getting into this, and the top was literally about 10" from being able to zip up. granted, i have a larger than average bust, but that's still excessive, and the fabric has no give whatsoever.the online pictures are pretty accurate representations in terms of look and shape. i think it would probably be best for pear s
other Adorable dress, amazing fit!
other Dress is very flattering on, not tent-like at all!
other Be aware that this cardigan runs small- as you can see on the model, it's a form-fitting style. it's not the kind of cardigan you would unbutton and take on and off as a layering piece. i would wear it more like a top with a button-up front. it is nice and soft and the black and white scalloped design is attractive. i would recommend it if you are looking for a more fitted top with this design. i'm not wow-ed by it, but it's nice in a 50's kind of way.
other Love the asymmetrical zipper, style, fabric and color. so soft, comfy and warm. i got a size small and it fits perfectly and isn't tight or loose. the pockets are sewn shut but easily opened by cutting the thread with scissors. highly recommend this cute and functional jacket!
other The fox print is super cute and the reason i ordered the skirt.  sizing was true to me, i'm usually an 8 and the 8 fit fine.  the waist is high and if you try to wear it low the side zipper puckers  out in a weird way.  skirt length is above knee (i'm 5' 6").  skirt is lined but the lining is dark brown/black same as the waist band in the photo of the model wearing it.  the lining does not show at the hem, it's concealed.  overall a fun a-line swingy skirt for late summer that will go into fall
other Great top, for me it would be tuck in only as a little wide near waistline. i am 5'other so can do it with top length, but not sure someone taller could. so depends on wardrobe needs what you plan on wearing it with. would probably look cute with skinny jeans, but i bought it for skirts. adorable detailing around neckline and sleeves. really love it, but more sheer than i expected. great with a nude bra, but probably would see other colors through it.
other These joggers are soo cute. they fit great!!i seriously love them!! i have worn them so ofteni may have to ban myself from them for a week.i am 5'other and the length was perfect for a jogger pant.i got an xs because the small looked too baggy. the xs loosened up a little after wearing them and are perfect.
other Great pair of pants to wear to work, and interview or out to lunch. i got so many compliments the first time i wore these. i'm 5'2" i ordered the burgundy color in a size 0, regular which is what i normally wear and they fit fine. however they were just a tad big in the waist and a tad tight around my calves but other that they're a great pattern pant to have you wont be disappointed!
other Great fit, runs maybe a tad big but overall great fit/quality.
other These got me so excited for fall. the teal is a color i'm really into right now and was the real reason i decided to order these. when they arrived though, i was delighted to find that they are light weight and have the perfect amount of stretch. the fit is snug, but hugs all the right places and are so comfortable! these will be a staple in my wardrobe. i want to order more colors!
other I really wanted to like this dress, but where the skirt meets the top of the dress in the back creates sort of a hunchback effect in the back. will be returning.
other Great news if you missed out on this tank last year! this s the exact style and cut as last season's buttondown tank released by c&s. super flattering fit, not too poofy. it *is* semi-open in the back and the slit goes as high as the last button. super sweet for summer and goes with virtually everything. i reeeeally wish they had this one in more colorways. it's grrrrr8!for reference i'm 5'6" 103lbs 34a 2other in jeans and i tried on an xs. last year i purchased an xxs petite and it fits exa
other This cardigan is light weight and can be used for all seasons. additionally, you can wear it tied in the front or down for a cascade look. can be worn for the office or with jeans. love this little good for everything closet staple!
other I bought this in blue/black. it is so pretty. i get so many compliments. i'm a size 4/6 but large busted. i bought this in a medium & it's perfect. just the right amount of fullness. i'm 5'4" so the length for me is perfect w/leggings.
other I've been searching for a brown top/dress/tunic forever and i finally found the perfect one!! i stumbled across this adorable tunic while browsing the clearance room at my local retailer and you can imagine my excitement when it was my size (small). i tried it on and almost asked to wear it out of the store. it's sooo soft and has a beautiful rib-like pattern/texture to it. you could wear it as a top with pants or a dress with tights/leggings.
other This top is absolutely gorgeous! it fits true to size to slightly large. i'd say size down if you are between sizes. it has a nice weight to it - not too heavy, but for a winter season top - it is not too thin. colors are as pictured. i can pair this with black pants or with skinny jeans. it is a top that i will wear for years to come.
other This is so pretty for summer. it is very lightweight and flattering on. the color was a little brighter than i expected, but it is still beautiful!
other Saw this in the store, looked at the price tag and decided to wait for a sale. got it this weekend with the 20% off and love it! (thanks retailer) wore it for my birthday dinner and received a ton of compliments. as someone else noted, it does catch on itself so take care when wearing. also, the slits on the side are semi-high but as my husband noted, this makes it a touch sexy instead of just a tunic. i went with an 8 for this reason(you could also wear a tank underneath). and yes, even on sale,
other Love this top! tried it on in store...so glad i did since it runs large and i had to size down to a medium. the color is a beautiful camel and the material is soft...very grateful the fabric content did not contain dreaded wool, lol! therefore leaving it soft and comfortable to wear...the price tag was a bit much considering it is only a sweater vest but with retailer price equals quality so i don't mind spending the extra $!
other I saw this sweater at the store and instantly love it. it run large. i am 5'8 and 120 pounds and usually a size s in most retailer tops. i had to go with xxs on this one so def size down.
other This dress is beautiful, and the a line shape is very flattering. i'm 5'10" and it hits just above my knees. i'm small on top, so the keyhole slit isn't an issue for me, but it does gap more than it does on the model. this dress has lots of versatility.  like another reviewer said, you can dress it up with heels, or dress it down with boots.
other I coveted this blouse for weeks and finally pressed go during the recent sale. it is truly lovely - the textured silk and its lining combine to give this blouse the weight it needs to flow perfectly when untucked. it is a-shaped and fuller at the hem. when tucked, it is neat as a pin. the colors are almost metallic and it looks as if the flowers have been painted on. this is an elegant casual look with white jeans and heels, or i've dressed it up with a black pencil as well as a skirt almost ide
other I got this dress to wear for christmas and it is perfect. looks great and is very comfy. low cut in front and back that is not too revealing and allows for perfect bra coverages. i got it in a small small.
other This is a beautiful dress, considering it is made from polyester. that being said, the material has a nice finish and looks like it could be silk. it's a flattering cut (other than being a tad short-waisted) and hangs well. it was also a bit tight through the bust. unfortunately, if you are on the taller side, it tends to be high waisted and short in length.my daughter is 5'11" and a size 10. the medium fit best, although because of the length, she is reluctantly returning it. sad, because it ha
other Got this to wear on a beach vacation later in august. i was hesitant to purchase what is essentially a light weight cover up at this price, but is is really cute. the only problem i have with it is the slits on the sides are a bit high up. it is a good color and feels very nice. i will wear this on tropical vacations and running about since it is so hot! i bought the medium and it is a perfect fit and comes to my knee in the front. for reference i am 5'8' and 160#.
3 I really wanted this swimsuit to work and it looks really nice in person and good quality as well, but sadly the top is cut really strangely. in the photo shown of the model, it looks like a v-neck that kinda gives your boobs a little push to the middle for some slight cleavage. however, that's not how it fit for me. the cups have removable padding on this suit, and when left in, my boobs didn't even fit in the thing and it just looked really awkward in general. and with the padding taken out, m
other I bought this tee becasue of the color and brand (my favorite tees last summer were by bordeaux) and am so pleased. the color is great for a fall layering piece, and the fabric is so soft....amazing! it may be better for layering, the fabric is very thin.
other I just love this hoodie! it is so soft and comfortable. i am usually an extra small and that size fit me great. i wish it didn't have the brand on the back of it but i can get over that. this is a very cozy piece that i will wear many times.
other This is a lovely sweater that doesn't look much on me the way it does on the model in the picture. i actually like it better on me! it's got a good scoop neck and it gives me a shape. i tried it on in a small and i'm on the fence about whether to buy it or not. i don't really need it, but with the discount codes retailer is offering these days i feel like i should buy it anyway...
other I bought these in light grey and navy. they are both beautiful. high quality,very flattering, and so comfortable! i love them! they're a perfect long length. i have long legs and it can be challenging finding a good length in pants. the pockets are deep and functional, which is rare in women's pants. they are more than i like to spend, but i will get a lot of wear out of them. they look and feel fantastic. i highly recommend these!
other I saw this top in my local store and almost didn't try it on solely because i hate split-sleeve/cold-shoulder tops. but, the peplum style and pattern were so cute that i took it into the dressing room anyway. after trying on probably 6-8 items, i wound up buying this top and one other. i really like the fit, as i am high-waisted, and it defines my waist really well . the wide neck is also super flattering. and i love the pattern. i went ahead and purchased, despite the fact that i wasn't thrille
other This top completely fell short for me. i was so excited for it to arrive yesterday and upon opening the package i knew immediately that it was not what i was expecting. in the images online there seam up the middle of the shirt isn't even noticeable but in person it is very prominent...and not in a good way. the peplum is a lot fuller then pictured as well. did not work well with my large bust (34d). returned.
other I love how soft, and substantial the fabric is. the fabric has a nice weight and drapes beautifully. the ruffle detail is very flattering. i have broad shoulders and this top looks great.
other I loved this dress when i tried it on. the plaid is darling and the plunge is sexy. i so wish it would work for my body type. the waist came a bit too high on me (almost a line) and it made me look kind of frumpy in the midline.
other Love this quirky romper. i'm normally a m/l or 10/1other and took a large in this. as the other reviews stated, it's a bit of a contortion act to get into and out of this but when in it fits well, is flattering and oh so cute.
other 1. i've been waiting forever for these to finally arrive. i was a bit disappointed.2. i'm 5'5" tall, 14other lbs, and 38-32-40. my normal size 30's fit me perfectly, if a bit loose. they fit a lot like the hyphens.3. the legs are short and wide. they hit me at the ankle, which made them look like high waters on me.4. the legs are very, very wide, and i didn't think that was flattering on me.5. same comfy fabric and fit as the hyphens, except the front seemed to dip low at the waist i
other I had been eyeballing this for a very long time because i loved the look of the skirt and this top (of which i snagged the skirt when it went on sale). i was delighted to finally take a chance and buy this when it went on sale, too. thoughts below:______pros:- it is well made and on the thicker side. - for a peplum, it is actually slimming. i am an hourglass and with hips, which usually means such tops flare out so much making me look wider in all the wrong places. so i was skeptical abo
other Regarding the product, high quality materials and overall make. extremely comfortable and flattering cut. i'd love this in all the colors of the rainbow.
other The color and fabric are really soft and lovely. it runs big so you can get away with a size smaller of even other sizes smaller. it would look great paired with leggings and boots and a long sweater coat or with skinny jeans and sandals. this is going to be my new favorite.
other Loved the brushstroke design and simplicity of black on white; however, the tee was way too big. it looked boxy and sloppy.
3 I kept this top, only because i needed a plain black tank, but there is nothing special about it. i found it a bit large and thin cheap material.
other These are just perfect, exactly as pictured if not nicer. very soft and comfy with a big sweater on for winter months.
other I was interested in this sweater because i actually thought it was a tunic. the sweater is much shorter than i thought. i wish i could return it. i bought a size large which is my normal size.
other I went to my local retailer store in kansas city,mo at country club plaza and let me tell you when i saw this sweater i mediately fell in love with it. i bought mine in the red color in a size medium and it fit me perfectly. i would definitely recommend getting this sweater because it's so soft and very flattering on my body type. i also love the pattern and definitely worth the money!!
other I purchased this top (i thought of it as a sweater) to wear for a chilly holiday in mn. it's super flattering and i think it would be on anyone! my 28 year old daughter saw it on me and claimed at a christmas present so i just ordered another. we have very different body types but the neckline made us both look very elegant and it is super comfortable. i haven't seen how it cleans, yet. we both got the lighter colored one...love!
other I am a 5'10" size other (or 28 long - i need a 33-34" inseam) woman. i bought the s/m and they fit perfectly (with all the excess length bunching at my ankles, as designed)! i'm thrilled. i bought the light color. one thing, wear nude underwear and lighter (or just short) socks - these are definitely see-through! however, i only plan to wear these with long tunics and sweaters anyways - something always reaching down to my upper thighs, at least. so comfy and cozy!
other I agree with the other reviews - great dress. i got a ton of compliments on it, but i had to take it to a tailor to get it taken in. not a fan of belts with dresses, but definitely wanted it so had quite a bit taken in. not sure why this seems to be a reoccurring issue with retailer. i was bummed i had to spend money to get the dress to look even somewhat like the photo.
other I just want you guys to be aware that the red print is not short sleeved! we have this in store and both are 3/other length sleeves! great material and fit.
3 I ordered this sweater in green, and it was a lovely soft color. the style of the sweater was nice -- really deep side splits made it feel trendy. the sweater is a great length, nice fabric and the side splits are appealing. however, it was just so, so big that i couldn't pull it off -- i just swam in it. i am 5'8" and 118 lbs, fairly wiry?.even the xs didn't work for me. perhaps it would look more suitable on a curvier woman. i even considered having it tailored, since i've had a hard time find
other This very lightweight and semi-sheer dress fits like a midi dress on my height. the back hem ends low calf and the front hem is below knee. straps are adjustable and bodice edge is elasticized. the print is pretty and can pair with any sweater or jacket or jewelry or shoes that hits your fancy. my concern is regarding the 100% rayon fabric and how it will hold up after cleaning as all of my 100% rayon clothing from *random fast fashion retailer* does not last long. i'm 5'3" 140# 39-28-3other and hap
other I was looking for a cross between a light, fall-wool jacket and a cardigan and this is it! the red version looks festive in the winter, and the hood adds a bit of spunk. looks great both open and buttoned. i received many compliments on this the first time i wore it.
other These cropped pants are very light weight and super cute. they seem to run just a bit small (i sized up one size from my usual) and don't seem to stretch so a size larger than you generally take may be necessary. the thin pin stripe design is very light in color so they are quite versatile.
other This dress is very comfortable. i bought both the small & xsmall and ended up keeping the xsmall i am 5'4" 12other lbs. 34c
other Love this shirt so much. it is comfortable and a beautiful print. i sized down because it is very flowy! it is ivory instead of white, but still looks beautiful. one of my favorite tops.
3 It was way to heavy and big for someone with a petite frame like me.i really liked the design and thought since it came in petite, i'd try it.it would probably be better on someone much taller but the material is still too heavy.
other I saw this dress in the store and was drawn to the pattern as an alternative to my normal lbd. it looked okay on the hanger, but when i tried it on...wow! so pretty and chic. it actually hangs a little lower in the front on me than on the model pictured which adds to the chicness and makes it a sophisticated take on a kimono. (my husband's words) i wore it out that evening to dinner and received several compliments. i did not have any issues with fit. i am a size 6 and purchased a size 6. it fit
other The fabric is great. the design is fun. i thought the dress would be perfect for work and also wear for a fun night out. the fit was perfect up top but the bottom part was to full and a lot longer then i expected. so i had to return it.
other I had a hard time deciding to order red or turquoise, as both colors are really nice in person. the black, of course, is a classic. another reviewer found the top to be small, but i found it to be a little big on me in my usual size. not too bad, but a little bigger than expected.teh neck part is effortless as there is stiching to help the colw effect stay in place. the fabric is thin though, so may show things (thinking bra ripples, and perhaps some other ripples in front tummmy). keeping it
other The front material is soft and cozy, but i was surprised to find that the back and the arms were a waffle knit, like long john material, very thin and tight in the arms. cannot wear a shirt underneath it, only tank top. other than that, it's a great deal
other Great looking casual dress, but i'm not sure about the fit on me. the skirt drape may be a tad overwhelming on my short legs if i want to emulate the styling of the green model. bodice fabric is a nice, clingy but lined stretch material of medium thickness. the skirt is a thin crepe viscose/rayon without a lining and i think it really needs one. i was hoping the skirt was the same material mix like the elysian maxi. i picked the medium petite and sizing down would be appropriate for ladies with
3 Purchased this should in the blue motif in size small. i am usually between a small and medium in shirts, 36c broad shoulders. the fit was fine in the small. however, i had a few issues with the top: 1) the blue motif looked actually like a faded blue (as if it had been washed quite a few times and looked worn), 2) the front mid/bottom section laid strangely and gave me a maternity look, and 3) the back has alot of fabric (see back of tank in white motif) and was very voluminous. for me, it wasn
other I was excited to see this dress as i'd bought the sparrow boiled wool sheath dress in xs last year and loved the fit. however, this dress does not fit the same way. the top fits fine, but the waist and the bottom are way too big. i laid it over my sparrow dress from last year, and the bottom is at least an inch wider (two inches, if you go by the total circumference). i'm planning to exchange for an xxs and see if that one fits better.
other This is a very pretty blouse. the fabric is lightweight and very soft. i read the other reviews and this does run very small, i ordered two sizes larger than i normally would and it fits very nicely.
other Let me start off by saying how pretty this top is, and heavy,.and itchy!  you would have to stand like the model does in the first shot to wear the top (with your arms not touching any part of the top!  the sequins will itch if you put your arms down (underneath the armhole).  another reason i didn't like the top was because the should straps are unadjustable.  i would have to get mine tailored for my 5'2" frame.  i usually wear a medium or 6/8 in tops and ordered this in a medium, it was roomy.
other Nice top; the material is soft and drapey. i like to wear it layered under a shorter shirt or jacket.
other This really was nothing special. for $68 there are much cuter tops at retailer. it wasn't particularly flattering as it was very boxy, so it added volume. it was soft and felt like decent quality which was nice. i agree with another reviewer that the ruffles feel too big. overall, this was just a miss for me.
other Really cute dress -- the lace-up detail is distinctive, and i think this dress will be versatile. great for hot weather, but i tried it on with retailer skinny pants, and that looked cool too. the included slip (not a lining) is soft and not clingy. i'm on the petite size and often find that relaxed-fit dresses like this make me look like i'm wearing a sack, but this one is not too billowy or shapeless. i tried the mango color on in the store, and really wanted to buy it, but the color just is not
3 Love the detail of the white with yellow underneath but agree with the other reviewer that the material is very thin in the back. also, it is a flowly top so you will need to size down. however, because of the shape it will fit snuggly around the chest/arms. this didn't work for me as it accentuated my normal body type (as in not the model type). i am not overweight but it definitely didn't flatter my chest area. seems like the top worked for others so i suggest trying on first.
other I love cloth & stone clothes and have this version in a long sleeved shirt. it is a little boxy, but the weight of the fabric helps with hang of it. i love the feel of the fabric and the weight of it for a summer dress, yet it is too sheer for a summer dress. it needs a liner or little cami dress to wear under it to keep it from being see through, however, for a texas summer, that defeats the point of a loose, easy dress to throw on. i sadly sent mine back.
other I'll admit, it's been a few months since i've shopped at retailer. i feel like i have to try on just about everything because there doesn't seem to be much consistency between the brands. i'm so glad i wandered in our local store this week! this top is so beautiful in person and well-made. the embroidery is lovely and it's lined, so not too sheer. i'm tall and it was a good length, hitting just above the hip. i think it runs tts or maybe just a tad big. the s fit perfectly across the chest,
other I bought the holly color which appears almost granite/slate color in natural light. overall, great transitional sweater piece for fall. i'm considering exchanging it for an xs since the s seems a bit large. comfy/cozy yet breathable.
other Too small... too flare... nice thick fabric. not my favorite pant.
other I took a chance and tried on this jacket today at the store. at first i was worried that it might look boxy on me but as soon as i put it on, it was love at first sight! it's so cute and very comfy! the sleeves are slightly long on me but that's been a recurrent issue regarding all my jackets. i'm only 5'3" about 12other lbs. and it fit me very well. because it's a bit cropped, it makes me look taller. glad the weather is starting to warm up so i can find more excuses to wear it. i didn't need anoth
other Absolutely love everything about this dress. unlike many other dresses i've ordered from retailer it fits me in the chest (34c). it's very flattering. love the lace up front and the fabric is like a soft lined linen. can't wait to wear it. i got the s regular. if i was any bigger in the chest or through the ribs tho it would be too small. i almost ordered the medium and was certain i would end up needing a bigger size but the small turned out just right. like it was made for me
other This is great just to have and throw on.it is a everyday piece.
other This skirt is beautiful (especially the color) and looks well made. however, i am very pear shaped and this skirt is just too straight to be flattering on me. i agree that it runs small but even when i sized up it still wasn't flattering. i imagine that those who were not bestowed with massive hips will look lovely in this.
other This dress was very boxy and unflattering. i really wanted to like it because the blue and white details were so pretty but it had to go back.
other I love this dress so much...what an excellent purchase! i wear this with white leggins and love the look. this dress has a sheath underneath the flower pattern that is form fitting, which i think is way sexy from the back. the front part of the dress is very flowy and moves nicely. i love the high neck on this piece and the beautiful colors. a wonderful pick up from retailer.
other These are light and airy and pretty. they also tore the third time i wore them and not on a seam - a little above the knee while i was lying in my bed.they also do not slim the figure and the fabric is slightly see-through as it is so thin, therefore if you are looking for serious lounge pants - great - i would not leave the house in them... or turn over in bed in them.when i sit, the slits fall down around my thighs. my son complimented my dress the other day because the slits give way
other I had hoped this bulky knit would be cuddly and soft, with suri (a type of alpaca) in the title. i don't know if the blend (45% polyamide, 25% royal baby alpaca, 20% fine merino) threw it, but had i felt this in store, i would never have even picked it up. unimpressed.
other This is a comfortable cardigan in a versatile color palette. size small fits a little snug in the shoulder area but other wise true to size. fabric is soft. great quality for the price!
other Has it been other years already. i too bought this other years ago. it peels and doesn't close but the horses make up for that. very very warm.
other Intrepid soul that i am, i washed it in the machine in cold water on a 2other minute cycle, then put it in the dryer for 8 minutes, shook it out, hung it up, and it is just the same as when it went in. doesn't need to be ironed and didn't shrink. yes, the swing is vast, but that is part of its charm. pair it with a fitted piece on the bottom and no one will think that you are actually needing that much material to cover anything! i think it is fun, something i will use for years, wonderfully comfort
3 I thought this top was adorable in the store and online. it just didn't work for me. although it fit, it flares out too much in the front and just wasn't flattering on me. i am 5' 5" and 128 lbs. and ordered the small.
other Can be a bit itchy sometimes, i guess depending on your skin. haven't had a problem with the sweater up to now!
other I bought this yesterday in store - i agree it runs large and sizing down keeps it from swallowing you.  i typically wear a large and went with a medium.  love the grey color - it will make a nice neutral.  am looking forward to wearing this well into fall/winter as i'm in the south where it takes a while to get cold.
other This is cut very strangely, i'm short waisted and this barely covered my belly button. the material is rough and scratchy. did not like at all and will be returning.
other This color is really cool because it can go with black, grey, or tan shoes. the back pleats are unique and do not add bulk. the back is also lined, so you don't need a tank. fits tts and i thought it was fairly flattering. on sale, this is a great deal.
other Gorgeous lace detail on this classic swimsuit. absolutely love it! fits true to size.
other I love this shirt! it is so different from most things i get but such a fun change. the colors are bright and fun! you totally do not have to be western to enjoy this shirt and it's fun for a good country dancing/party/concert too. my roommate has already asked to borrow it (as in she's wearing it at a concert as i type this!). it is incredibly comfortable! i got the xs and was kind of surprised it still felt a little big. but i kept the size to wear it half tucked or even kind of oversized. i w
other I read the other reviews and from the picture it looked as though it may be a little short, so i ordered up to a large. the medium would have fit, but since i'm in my mid-40's i felt more comfortable with large. but if you are trim and young or young at heart your usual medium will be fine. live the material and the navy makes it classy and rich looking. can be dressed up or down. have worn it to a cocktail party fundraiser with blue crop pants and received many compliments. i'm always challenge
other I bought this shirt in a l, since i didn't want it to be too fitted and was concerned a m would be. it is so boxy! it's like a completely different shirt. i have no idea how it looks good on anyone, unless it is simply widened the larger the size. maybe a m wouldn't be as wide and therefore as boxy, but this shirt is just a bad mess. returning.
other I normally stay away from dresses like these because they have a tendency to make my tall, hourglass frame look like i had one too many burgers. however, i saw one left in the store and was drawn in by it's color and beautiful sequins. my thoughts below:________pros:- exactly as pictured. i got the purple option, but i did see another lady grab the green. both are beautiful in different ways.- like another mentioned, the sequins on the bottoms gives some weight to the dress, but in a g
other This top is lovely and so perfect for this time of year when you want to look fall-ish but when it's still too hot to wear long sleeves. but i'm pretty sure it's navy, not black. very dark navy, yes. still, not black. compared to every other black top in my closet it looks navy. so that was a little disappointing. but i'm keeping it because i'm a sucker for a flowy top, and i can wear it right now.
other Purchased this in the wine color and love it! the detail at the neck at the bottom hem gives it an extra flair. i went with a small so that it was more fitted. love that it is stylish and comfortable. paired with knee high boots given it length but could also work well with short boots, like the photo.
other I love this brand! they produced a number of incredibly cute blouses in 2006-2010 and i've missed their quirky designs. this shirt does not run small. i am usually a 6 and have a little extra room in the chest area, even though i'm a 34dd. the arms are the perfect length as well which is nice as i have long arms. the only reason i did not give it five stars is that i wish it was a bit more fitted through the stomach area. its very billowy. i may take it to the tailor... so cute though! on a side
other This is exactly what i was expecting. cute, comfortable and casual. there are some gold sequins in the scroll work that i didn't see online. they are super pretty in person.
other I love the idea of this top and ordered it in white. it is a great design and proportion is nice with jeans. the front is off white t shirt material with a pocket and the back is a light grey heathered panel. i am returning it as it is very thin and the quality is cheap looking. if the grade of material had been a bit thicker and better made, then it would have been a winner!
3 I instantly fell in love with the graphic pattern on this drapey layering piece, and i've received compliments every time i have worn it. however i seriously considered returning it because the way the garment is cut causes it to bunch awkwardly at the sides. maybe it's still just too big--even though medium or large is my size in tops, the medium in this sweater clearly looks baggier on me than it does on the model in the photo, for instance. it is definitely not slimming, but the striking patt
other Loved this online and even better in person. inner lining is like a cozy sweatshirt!
other I love this! it is comfortable, flowing and reminds me of glamorous women in 1970's movies. i especially love that is completely looks like a shirt (its pants) because i don't have to worry about my skirt flying up as i race around the city. bra// no bra doesn't matter, which i love. as someone with a larger bottom then top and am pretty tall, i usually have trouble finding one piece items that aren't too short in the crotch/waist zone. very roomy without looking like a sack.
other I love these pants. bought them in both black and burgundy. but the burgundy pair split in the butt before i even made it to work in the morning. they weren't even tight. so disappointing. i will be returning them.
other This shirt fits really well- i ordered a size small and it's definitely a bit form fitting. i was a little bit hesitant to purchase this at first- for a tshirt it's a pretty hefty price. but the quality and cut are really quite attractive and worth every penny.
other Horrible fit not true to size again aline outside of the dress and a very tight camisole underneath
other I saw this online and wasnt sure and actually walked right past it in the store. but my usual stylist walked around the store with me and insisted it was a goodone. she usually knows what she is talking about... super soft nd comfortable, love the long sleeves (it has hidden buttons), cut is flattering on everyone. i ended up ordering petite size. turtleneck is not too tight, and the dress can pretty mjuch be dressed up or down. my friend also bought it (huhm twinsies)!! my favorite design was t
other I really like the warmth and loose cut of this sweater. it is great for layering and looks nice dressed up or down. my only gripe is i would love for it to have a second fastening. if it had another snap a little further down the body you keep keep it more securely closed. other than that it was a really great purchase.
other I love an item of clothing that i am able to justify its purchase by knowing it is unlike any other piece in my closet. this skirt definitely fits that desire.the material looks almost like the colors were "felted" onto the dark background creating a wearable art piece! very vibrant colors. the material itself is somewhat stiff and maintains its structure when on. i needed to wear a size 6 (i'm sometimes a 4; sometimes a 6 with a waist measurement of 28") and the skirt sits at the smallest part
other I love this skirt... i have it in black, and when i saw this color i was so excited to add another one to my wardrobe. these skirts are made  well... it's not flimsy at a all. the actually color is more of a light aqua blue, so if you are wanting a baby blue might not be for you...
other I thought it would be heavier than it is. it's thin and more delicate than what i would expect for a winter sweater (it contains wool so not really suitable for spring/summer). it's also shorter than it appears on the model and a little wider/boxier too.
other Cute, comfortable, easy to wear, even on my hourglass figure. can't decide the best shoes to wear with this - so it doesn't look frumpy.
other I'll start this by saying i usually wear a m or l depending on the shirt. i'm 20 weeks pregnant and ordered a medium. it's huge! i was thinking i would be able to wear this for a bit while preggo and then would be able to wear it after baby with no problem. i'm going to order a small because the fabric is so soft and i love the design and color.
3 It's a t-shirt. a very cute print, nice cut, very soft--but a t-shirt. therefore, why is it almost $50???? tried it on in the store and loved it, but i just can't justify $50 for a t-shirt.for those who will not be deterred by the price: i normally wear about an 8-10 dress size at retailer, and the medium fit well.
other Love this romper! it is beautifully made and classy. the fabric flows and the construction is soft and solid. i'm 5'5" and 13other and the small is a little roomy but comfortably so. can't wait to where it.
other I'm in love with this print! the fabric is very soft too. as others have noted it is small in some odd spots and a little big in others, but overall my usual size worked out great. i wear it with a cute belt to enhance an hourglass look, because it's pretty drapey. really versatile, lovely tunic.
3 Gorgeous in every way except its length and how it hangs at the bottom. i prefer a shirt i can wear tucked in or out. this one will work well tucked in but not out so i am returning disappointed it was so well done in other particulars.
other I highly recommend this dress!!!!!! i was a little nervous about purchasing this dress online because previous reviewers were saying that it creates static, but nothing that a little static guard couldn't prevent! :) i purchased a medium petite and i am about other feet tall, usually a size 8 in dresses and it fit perfect! (wore for thanksgiving) the fabric and style are very forgiving and the dress sort of flows with you when you walk, which i love!!
other I love , love this top !! it looks just like the picture on model. the front is a soft t-shirt and the back is so cute and flattering . super unique and comfortable style.!! i am 5'other -10other and xs fits perfect.
other Like another reviewer, i recently had a baby and ordered this to hide my belly. the m fits perfectly without looking too large, and the sleeves fit me just fine. i love the thicker fabric, and his is he perfect length for leggings.
other I fell in love with this top when i first saw it in the store, and bought it during the 25% off sale. i'm petite, 32dd, usually a size 4. i tried the xs and s and while both fit, i like the roominess of the s so i got that size. i bought the regular size for a little extra length, but could have worn the petite. it's great for layering because of all the bright colors, and although the front is polyester, the back is knit so it's nice and cool. i personally love loose-fitting, shorter tops, so i
other I like this on the model so i ordered it. it is not quite as deep in color as online but still pretty. it fits well not too loose and not tight at all. i will get great use out of this all the way through spring!
other This is such a pretty dress. i was worried the arm holes would be too big since it was hard to see them in the pictures, but they are perfect! there is a built in red slip underneath. it is so cute on and really flattering by itself or even with some white skinny crop jeans underneath!
3 I bought this shirt in 3 colors. soft, comfortable fabric, as other reviewers have mentioned, and nice detailed sleeve. i am gravely disappointed in the fabric quality since after wearing this one time with a necklace (as shown in the picture) it developed tiny pulls. i should mention that it was a very plain necklace, nothing sharp, pointy etc. i will most likely return all 3 shirts.
other I really liked these pants! they are so audrey hepburn. i especially like how they come up high on my waist. i actually bought 3 different pairs of "essential" pants and kept all of them. (essential taper and essential slim). i stated that these run small but they just seem to run smaller than the other two. i'm 5'3" and they are a touch longer than i'd like but that is an easy fix. for reference, i'm 110 lbs and bought size other in these and 0 in the others
other The bright poppy red is gorgeous and the cut flattering and interesting. i'm usually between a m and l in tops but went with a s in this one because it looked too sloppy in my usual size. i'm a 32-3other d with arms that aren't tiny, and it's a bit tight across the shoulders when i reach forward but not enough to be a problem. in the smaller size it skims my hips nicely but isn't as long as pictured on the model. i would suggest pear-shaped girls size down if in-between. it is sheer but not so much
other This is a great t-shirt; i love it. it fits great, isn't too bulky and has a great length to go with anything. i love it.
other I like this dress because it has a 60's vibe. however, if this swing style is too long, it just looks dowdy. this dress was too long, so i shortened and redeemed mine. i am 5'3 1/2" and 120 lbs. this style looks best on me just above the kneecap. if you try it on and hate it, it's probably because it's too long. in the winter i wear this with a long sweater (knee length) with a waistband in it to give it shape and with boots. the dress is lined but it is very, very sheer and requires a slip. or,
other Perfect fit. this dress is super flattering, the criss-crossing fabric at the bust looks awesome on. the fabric is a little bit thicker through there which is nice for coverage. the skirt is light and airy and the pattern is so pretty! the perfect spring to summer dress!
other I got some nice things for christmas but this (along with the matching leggings) was hands down my absolute favorite gift! so stylish, so cozy, the perfect length to cover your bottom, the perfect fit (38dd and ordered an xl), love the pockets, i could go on and on. the perfect set to lounge around the house in. sleeves are a bit long so i had to fold them. when i say it is "the perfect fit" it is oversized (not huge) but it is roomy and that's how i like it as loungewear.
other I have been on the fence about this blouse until i went into the store and tried it on. instant love for me.the fabric is not sheer.....yeah! the shoulders are cut in, so you may need a halter bra. i typically go between a other or 6, but found the cut at a a line so there is a nice flow, but not overly so, so purchased the 4. the colors will go with anything, for many seasons. love the quality.
other This ia very pretty dress. however, it is a unique design. i like the design of the dress, but i can see where some may not. i can't see a younger person wearing this. it is more for an older woman. the dress is so soft, does wrinkle easily, but just a beautiful pattern and comfortable. i can see some of my friends thinking this is too much like a nightgown, but i really love this dress!
3 Material is nice. design would be so great if it didn't fit so large! i am 5'4" 118lbs, athletic build. the dress could be belted i think (a very slim girl at retailer did this), but it is not worth $158 in my opinion. if on sale i might keep it due to the hastle of returning it, however, it is not "flowy." it fits okay in the shoulders, almost too loose, and the rest looks like a potato sack. so disappointed!!
other I love how you can wear this with a t-shirt or blouse.
other These days i am more like a 6 after gaining some weight. when i was in my local retailer the other day i happened upon this dress only in a small/petite. i tried it on and it actually fit me very well. i am other foot 6 so i thought the petite might be too short or wouldn't work, but surprisingly it fit my body type. i think i'll like wearing it best with a pair of wedges or heels. like most other reviews i'm inclined to agree that the regular size has too much fabric going on and probably is s
other I remember the first time i walked into an retailer store: like walking into a dream of all my favorite things. i've finally found a store whose products help me to express myself. as a writer, i love whimsical & out of the ordinary. i have found my honey hole. every time one of the pastel bags w/ribbon handles is past over the counter or i push 'add to cart' on my computer, i do a little happy dance in my heart. my closet is like a candy store filled with sweets & treats. thank you retailerp
other I cannot give this dress enough praise!! i say it runs a little large because i'm normally an 8 but the 6 was just more flattering.  i wore it for a wedding and i was showered with compliment after compliment about the dress! i've never felt more beautiful, and wish i could have one in every color! and quality? absolutely amazing.
other This shirt is amazingly soft and has such a great cut, especially for me being curvy. i love to pair this with cute leggings or tight ankle jeans with my boots. recently wore on a casual date with the hubby and he loved it paired with my dark brown leather jacket and dark jeans. only reason i gave it other stars was that the shirt tends to stretch out a little at the bottom is seems as you wear it throughout the day - it is still a great shirt and if possible i would buy more. need to bring
other Really cute casual dress. wore it to a "girls night" out!! they all loved it. can't wait to wear it again with knee high boots!
other These are my favorite flare jeans! they have that lovely 70's style and go with everything and look great all year round. the fit is perfect. my all time favorite jeans.
other This dress is wonderful. fits perfect. very comfortable. wonderful colors.
other I ordered the navy/green combo in xl and it's prettier in person. the fit matches the model so it's true to size for me. it is loose through the body. it's not slimming but not widening either. if you like how it looks on the model, that's how it should be when you try it on.it's soft and flowy and perfect for feeling comfortable. i love how the arms and chest are more fitted. the material has give to it. the stitching everywhere was well-done, no loose strands. it's a great basic. i'm going t
other Disappointed :-(this top has a boxy shape and looked like a mini moo moo on me. i have a similar shape as the model and it looked nothing like that on me. bummer! i liked the quality and weight (not too heavy nor too light) but shape is unflattering. it's going back.
other Really like these -- they fit really well and look great with a pair of chucks and a sweater if i'm dressing down a bit, as well as with flats and a nicer blouse. really versatile. i'm kind of pear-shaped, and these seem to minimize my flaws a bit, too, so that never hurts!
other I bought this tunic is blue. it is now one of my favorite tops to wear with skinny jeans or even leggings. i have always love rayon. this top did not disappoint me. it feels very soft and silky which makes it perfect for warmer days. for reference i am 5"1' 12other lbs, the xs p fits me just like the model...lose and not too long. i love it so much that i am considering another in different color.
other This is one of the best things i've ever purchased at retailer. it's comfortable, stylish, and flattering. i ordered it in black, and i'm now ordering the green as well. i usually wear small in the dolan line, and this is no exception. i am 5'2", 13other lbs, athletic build, and the regular small fits perfectly.
other Love me some pilcro jeans! these fit like the stet jeans.i got my usual size 27p and the fit is good but not too tight. i am not crazy about the hem but they feel so good that they are worth it. they don't come above my ankle like on the model but come slightly below which i really like. i will say that if you want a true black, you may not like this color. they are more of a faded black.
other I love these pants! first, they are super flattering. for a new mom, the waist comes up high and tucks everything in without rolling over. second, they are versatile. you can pair them with pointed flats, boots or casual with sneakers. i am wearing mine with cream flats and the cream moth boucle colorblocked pullover sweater. also - normally i am an xl (especially for length!) but the large fit perfectly. i didn't want to say that they ran large, because they aren't too loose.
other I have to disagree with some previous reviews -- i think the buttons on these ankle jeans really set them apart. they look absolutely adorable with booties, flats, wedges, heels, anything! and they're extremely comfortable and flattering, as most pilcros tend to be. i got my usual size 26 and the rise and fit is great. i think maybe they stretch out a bit; i've only worn them a couple times and by the end of the day the waist seems a little loose. but overall, great and a good price (at least co
other This is a beautiful, flattering dress, however i can't decide whether to keep it or not! as a few other reviewers has mentioned, the transition between the "top" and the "skirt" is a bit off - it's like there is some extra fabric there, and the weight of the skirt pulls it down, making it a little awkward/bunchy. i thought it may have been showing up because i am larger chested (36d), but you can kind of see this on the teal dress image, under the chest where there is an extra fold. i ordered th
other I purchased this in the mauve color. beautiful color with tan skin for the summer, but also perfect for fall. the material is very thin but not sheer at all. has quite a bit of drape/swing to it so i sized up to make sure it was long enough. it fits me like it fits the model shown here. i am about 5'4" 115lbs and 32b and am keeping the small.
other I have purchased many dresses from retailer for weddings and events.  this is the first time i have been disappointed with the quality.  however, the sleeve on this dress ripped after lifting up my toddler son in the middle of a wedding.  the size other seemed to fit perfectly, but the fabric had no give.  it was not overly tight in the bust as i am bra size 34aa.  for the price, i expected better.  the color and style of the dress is gorgeous, so perhaps ordering one size up is the answer. . .
other These legging are adorable. i love that i was able to get them in a petite size and the detailing of these pants are awesome. the buttons at the ankle are cute. i truly feel these leggings are worth the price i paid for them because normally i don't like to spend so much on leggings.
other Great spring time dress that looks good with a thin top, a cardigan or by itself. the fit is a bit loose but not oversized in my usual size, so if you want a slimmer silhouette or you are not busty, i would size down. love the fabric as it has some give despite its thickness. i would have paid full price but i'm lucky to have purchased on sale.
3 This is a very cute designed shirt but it fits very boxy and runs large
other I very rarely buy at full price but had to have this on and it is worth it.  i sized down and fits great. tons of compliments!
other I bought the design which has now sold out, of the sailboats and waves along the top. the t-shirt is super soft and thin. but, it's not sheer or see-through. very light and cool for hot humid summer days. has some nice stretch as well. a really gentle cotton knit.this top does run large. maybe that's so it will be cool and not stick to you? thus, i didn't size down because i don't like clothes too form-fitting on super hot days.
other Great comfortable dress with style! this ran a little large, so i returned for a medium! so glad i did!!!! you can dress down with a pair of low sandals and sun hat or dress up with some heels and hair pulls back!
other This top is really pretty and i received a lot of compliments on it. i said it ran true to size, but really the torso part runs a little big. if i had sized down, i think it would have been too tight in the arms. the cami that came with it kept falling out, which is no big deal, but be aware that the strings might not hold the cami with the shirt. overall, it's a really pretty blue and the details make it worth it.
other After reading some reviews about it running small i decided to order the 8 instead of my regular size 6 and bingo! i'm 5"7' 14other lb. dress hits right above my knees. i'm between slender and curvy.
other These are beautiful and very comfy. they do run very large. i ordered the green in medium and deciding wether to exchange for a small. the washing instructions in the pants are to dry clean for best results. the description needs to be updated to reflect this.
other This top doesn't at all fit like it does on the model. the mid section is very wide and boxy and the material is thick and almost sweatshirt-like. i typically wear size small or 4, but perhaps an xs might've fit or looked better. sadly i must return this shirt.
3 I ordered this blouse as a gift for my mom. it is too pricey to live up to my expectations. it is quite sheer and the hem of the sleeves are unfinished which you can't see in the pictures. this makes a very expensive blouse look cheap. it is made of viscose and dry clean only. the material used is not on par with the price in my opinion. if it had been real silk or another natural fiber, ok. but for me this and the unfinished hem along with the price is a deal breaker for me.
other Love these lounge pants. i live in florida and was worried they might be too heavy. not the case at all. very soft and lightweight. so comfortable!!!
other I bought these about a month ago in the sky blue - gorgeous color! i was a little disappointed because they fit bigger than i normally wear my pants, but i decided to keep them anyway. they are the most comfortable pants i've ever worn - butter soft. i have dressed them up with a nice top and suede booties, and also worn casual with a baggy sweater and toms. i highly recommend these pants!
other This is not something i would normal wear but the beauty of the fabric made just give it a try. i am so glad i did. the fit is beautiful slimming feminine fit with just enough flow. i love it and bought it right away. you better get it before it's gone. also it is true to size, i have along torso so sometimes i have issues with jumpers but not this one.
other Yes! i am 5' 120 lbs and busty. this hugs in the right places. there is no extra fabric so it doesn't appear overwhelming on me as even some petite blazers do. i had purchased the same brand blazer but in the mustard color and it did not fit well. this fits beautifully. the denim color is just like the picture. the sleeves are a tad long. so i just rolled them up - no bulk. i ordered a size 6 petite.
other I'm so in love with these pants. they are so flattering and made of thick material. they do run a bit large though so i'd suggest you size down. i also like they they're high waisted. the gold button details are gorgeous as well. great pair of pants.
other Such a cute skirt! the fabric is comfortable and light, and the the tie in the front helps conceal some of those "tummy issues" a lot of people want to hide. :)
other This top is lovely and flowy! it fits true to size, and the lace detail at the neck is perfect to make this top stand out. i felt like it was a little sheer, but it wasn't problematic enough for me to take away a star :-)
other This is a great "go to" top. it isn't too low, too tight, too dressy or too casual. i'm 5'other and ordered a small petite. it fits perfectly, especially under the arms, (where tops always show my bra) & it doesn't go "too" low. i have to admit, i purchased the dusty rose color, i'm not sure how great it complements my olive skin, but i love it anyway.
other This dress is easy to dress up or down, and is very comfortable.
other Great hopes but a sorry disappointment. at this price, one should be able to expect better pattern alignment as shown on model. the pattern in the garment i received was poorly matched on either side of the button placket. i am 5'6" and ordered xxs. garment was significantly over-sized. i would have had to order one and probably two sizes smaller to achieve a decent fit. because of the oversizing, the shape is more boxy than it appears in the catalog photo. sadly, this buttondown has to be retur
other Really well made. beautiful. sadly it is very short. not a tunic at all.
other This dress is made of a wonderful, thick material that is flattering. i think the photo doesn't really bring it to life- it's a great dress that can dressed up and is at least a 3 season dress thanks to the colors. the v-neck is a little deep if you are bustier but not inappropriate for a slightly more casual office. it runs a bit large and the fabric has some give so i would potentially size down. i also think if you are more narrow shouldered it might not be the best fit without a nip and tuck
3 I guess i am in a comfort clothing mood these days since i have been looking at a lot of them lately! this one is a nice thicker material and i like that the sleeves go all the way down, but i am not a fan of the design. i felt the color scheme was very plain. the neckline comes up higher on me than i would have expected and makes me feel like i am choking. it is not a flattering cut on me and does not accentuate anything i would want it to, nor does it hide imperfections. it truly is comfort we
other This dress is loose, unique, and super cute! you'll get noticed in this dress! i ordered down a size.
other Love the fabric and design of this dress, very unique and comfortable. it is not lined, which explains the lower price when compared to other well fashioned dresses. i wore it successfully with stockings and no slip and it did not ride up or cling strangely. the fabric is stretchy and form fitting without feeling tight. the ribbons that define the detail around the waist were a bit snug but we're not uncomfortable. they define the waist very well. i am 5'7'',127lbs, athletic build and the other fit
other Love this sweater so much that i'm going to order another when it goes on sale! the material is not thick but it's a nice thin weight that i still feel cozy in. i love that it's not long in the back too. so cute and soft.
other I tried this on in the store, and i found my regular medium to be a bit too boxy. i ended up going with the petite large because i found it just fit better. it wasn't too wide and fit just right.it is very soft, not itchy at all. it says dry clean only but it did great on my hand wash setting with cold water. laid it out to dry. great purchase.
other Love this coat - great fall piece! i bought the green color and it looks as shown in the picture. great retailer purchase!
other I really love this shirt! i ordered the orange and am considering getting the other color too. it's very comfortable and cute. i got a lot of compliments when i wore it. this shirt definitely runs large and i had to exchange the medium for a small. the looser cut makes it very easy for this to look like a maternity shirt, so i'd advise everyone to size down.
other Paige jeans are obviously known for their luxurious feel and amazing fit. these jeans are the best new addition to your collection. the perfect high rise and not as extreme flair, these might beat out your skinny jeans for your nights out. they do come extremely long, so they will most likely need to be hemmed. i get huge compliements when i wear them and told how they compliement my legs in the best way. if you're debating on whether to jump onto the flair trend, i'd go with these!
other Love this cardigan. the quality is beautiful and and comfortable. i think the cable stitching and pockets add such a unique touch.
3 The design of these is adorable with the lace up ties however they are a dingy looking off white color. they are also pretty see through. returned.
other I was so bummed to see how quickly this top sold out online in the black. however, to my delight, i happened to stumble upon the shirt in my size in my local store recently. knowing it was sold out online, i immediately grabbed it to try on. big mistake: i instantly fell in love. i'm a curvy woman (34d chest, wide hips, small waist and a slight tummy) and this shirt fits beautifully in my usual size (which is a medium in deletta). hugs my figure without making me look big. i work in an office wh
other This is the mid-weight fall/spring jacket i had designed for myself in my head! someone got into my head and made it! really - i could not have dreamed up a lovelier jacket. it fits like a glove, it's absolutely the softest thing ever, and the (removable) lining is far warmer and plusher than i expected (i wore it out tonight on a a clear, cold night - i felt like i was wearing a hug). nice, feminine waistline and pockets in all the right places round it all out. i look forward to unbuttoning th
other Love this dress! the material has a softness to it - just love it! can't wait to wear it this summer. fits true to size.
other I loved the look of this dress online, so i was excited to order it, but when it arrived i found it was not at all how i expected it to be. i thought the material would be more lacy, but it seemed pretty cheap. there was also some boning at the waist which is nice in theory, but it made the material poof out just under the waist, making me look like i had a belly. no matter what i did i could not get it to lay flat. returned to the store and bought the embroidered perennial dress instead, which
other I bought this for a swim suit cover up and i'm very happy with it. the fabric is thin and rather sheer, i wouldn't buy it to wear it outside as a regular dress. i'm 5'6" and the front of the dress hits me above the knees. the fabric is soft and comfy. the blue with white piping is pretty and the fit is flattering. i'm really happy with this dress.
other This is a great top. soft and cozy fabric, nice and sturdy feeling. it's heavier than i though it'd be so its perfect for the cooler days of spring, and even a chilly summer night. i love that it's long enough in the front for me to feel comfortable wearing leggings. the body is nice and roomy but the arms are a little snug, however, i like that because i think it makes it look less like a slubby sweatshirt. the best part... it can be cleaned in the washer and drier! thrilled with this purchase!
other Love this sweater for so many reasons; fits true to size, unique in design, versatile, soft and so easy to wear. i've worn it tied in the back and front. it goes great with a skirt or dress pants for work, date night and elevates the look with any of my jeans. i love haying clothes i can get the most out of. highly recommend this sweater!
3 Two strikes against this top, and its going back. first, the white top is a light weight cotton... and it does not come with a lining or shell underneath. just know you will need one. i would have been able to get over that fact, since i have tanks i could have worn, but second strike is that it wrinkles. alot. it came out of the shipping box with the type of wrinkles that i know will get way worse after washing. i am not interested in ironing anything. for this price, i wouldn't have expected b
other I ordered the xxs p as this dress is not a fitted dress, and that was the right size for me. only thing is the length is a bit linger still 9lower on calf for me), the straps are almost tight, so i would say the dress is a reversed taper shape. color is beautiful, i ordered green as the other color (plum) doesn't have petite available. green is rich, and classy, the fabric is surprisingly soft. i love the little details in the velvet. definitely need a strapless bra for this one.11other lbsm 30d
other Tried them on in store. they were actually kind of sexy on. i have an hourglass figure and the way that these fit, felt sort of like a 50's/60's fit, accentuating and flattering my shape. on my to get list.
other I love these shorts, the subtle floral pattern is even prettier in person. the drawstring waist allows me to customize the fit for my newly pregnant belly.
other Really cute tee... charcoal is deep and great all seasons. cut high on sides... may need to size up to accommodate - depends on body shape. tried the white, didn't buy--- too lightweight, but could work layered.
3 I loved almost everything about this skirt. thick and lined and love the buttons. comfortable. the only problem was that the two sides flared out at the bottom, presumably from the buttons. i was torn, but in the end it just looked too silly and it was sent back.
other This. jumpsuit. is. amazing.i ordered the small, and it fits perfectly - loose and flowy, with room for boobs (i'm a 32d) and hips. perfect for humid summers when you'd rather your clothing hang a bit away from your body. the fabric is deceptively light for how it hangs (in a very flattering way) when i have it on. i would say that if you're shorter than 5'4", the petite is the way to go. however, i am 5'4" and the length hit me almost exactly where it is on the model. i lifted the leg a
other I was excited when i saw these shorts in my local retailer store. i wear a 2other sometimes 26 and i grabbed an xs. however, when i tried these shorts on i was sad to see that they run big and looked baggy on me. they fit, but are really loose. i am probably going to have to return these because they don't come in an xxs. they are great shorts and a perfect length, but make sure you size down.
other Fit is "breezy" which is what i expected. a little on the loose side but comfortable and still cute. the slip that accompanies the dress is of decent quality as well.  the back of the dress is not that much longer than the front, as in the picture, but i still liked the dress enough to keep it.
other The small, zipped and laid flat, measures 16" across at the bottom of the armholes, 11" at the waist and 18" from shoulder seam to bottom edge. it's too small for a size 0, and not by just a little! too bad, because it really is very pretty.
other I ordered ths thinking it was likea blazer, but it is soft and not structured, like a t-shirt. however, it is rather flattering on. i had a har dtime deciding whether to keep it. the regular size was fine on me, i usually require peites, but this doesn't come in petites, and it was really nice with the fitted cowl shirt i was wearing. i am definitely putting it back in my wish list (as i did end up returning).
other Timeless skirt. just don't like the placement of the slit, so maybe i'll sew it up.
3 I love the relaxed flattering fit of these pants but the navy die runs..a lot. the first time i washed them t did so per instructions on the label. i did my next load of laundry and everything turned blue/ grey! i tried washing them again with vinegar to set the color and hopefully that will help. lots of color running still though, so to be safe wash and then run washer with nothing in it to clean it before doing more laundry. i'm keeping them because i like the pants, but wanted to let you kno
other I love this dress because it is everything i have been looking for. it is flattering because of the details and it gives the illusion of an hourglass figure if you don't have one. i love that it has sleeves because sometimes i just don't feel like finding a shawl or bolero or whatever in case i get suddenly anxious about my arms. the green is dark and shimmering almost like lace over jewel tone emerald. love.
other I just got this in xs/s at my store and i love it. i have a petite frame (5'3", +/- 10other lbs) so it's much longer on me than on the models. and the one i got is much more saturated with dye on the front than what's shown in retailer's pics, so that may vary a bit. however, the back of mine looks exactly like what's shown above. i love the drape and the way it falls on me; super casual-chic in my opinion. i'd say the color is deep teal. wish it wasn't hand wash, but sometimes that's worth it.
other As per usual bordeaux is perfect with this cardigan. very soft, washes well. love it.
other I find it very hard to find a dress. never like the way they look on me..this one???? fits like a glove, flatters my silhouette (which is difficult because even though i am at a good weight my waist is never small). looks like million bucks on me....i love it!!!
3 The fit was fine, but the fabric (the beige option) was bland. it washed me out. granted, i'm fair skinned, but it reminded me of sour milk. it's getting returned.
3 I'm 5'9" and these run true to size for the fit but having long legs by the end of the day they start to sag down in the crotch and hit me about mid calf straight out is the package. they wash up perfectly and are cozy. if you're of average height these will probably be your favorite.
other This is a charming sweatshirt top with extra details to make it stand out! the front panel has lovely art nouveau style embroidery and cut outs. i'm going to enjoy wearing this with jeans - it looks great with gray or black denim. the colors are fabulous for someone with "spring" coloring - the front panel is a very pale peach / peche. i'm 5'4", 128lbs, with small shoulders and 32c chest, i'm typically a size 2-other or size xs-s, and ordered an xs. it fits well, a little tighter than on the model -
other Based on the mixed reviews about fit, i waited to purchase until i could try it on in the store and was not disappointed. i'm wondering if there are different batches of this dress? i'm 5'7 and the dress fit as in the photo. the side slits come above my knees but not too high. arm holes are a bit large so if you want more coverage this may not be for you. the material is cozy and soft. the cream color is gorgeous. size wise, it definitely looks boxy and marshmallow-like if too loose. i am usuall
3 Okay, so this top has its redeeming qualities, i promise! which is why i gave it 3 stars when i really wanted to give it two. but it's just not worth other because i'm sure it works for some people and the quality is just impeccable. for people who purchase this, it will last forever. it's sturdy cotton, not thin like many retailer tee materials. the lace detail and texture is on point and the neckline is very nice. it's a great looking top. my issue though, wasn't with the bust as other reviewers hav
3 This dress didn't work for me for several reasons, but i knew i wouldn't keep it as soon as i saw the ribbing on the neck and arms, which makes an otherwise flexibly styled dress (dress up/dress down) into super casual only (plus it looks cheap). it is also not for the long waisted or tall.on the plus side, the fabric feels great, and it hangs well.
other What a great fit! it is casual, but can be dressed up. i could have done the extra small, but the small isn't too big and is still flattering.
other This sweater is gorgeous - the colors are beautiful and the piece itself is soft. i do think it is a bit shorter than i would prefer, and i tend to wear petites. the sweater is nice enough that i do not mind!
other Just purchased this for a midsummer formal wedding. i am 5'6'' 12other lbs, ended up going with the size other for extra room, the 0 felt very snug thru the chest.
other Very pleasantly surprised by this top! it's looser, but in a flowy not baggy way. i ordered the m. thevee is just right on me, tasteful but just low enough. love the sleeve lengthordered thinking another black tee , but it's going to be well used,and great for evenings.
other Tried this on in the store and fell in love. it's such a simple shirt but the details are special. runs tts. will get a lot of use out of this.
other This top has slightly more of a burnout effect than i realized. i like it and its great for layering, but you must wear something underneath as it is quite sheer.
other I ordered the gray/plum colorway and while i'm disappointed in the large percent acrylic fabrication, the vest is very soft and warm. the unfinished raw seams add visual interest and i'm tempted to remove all the care tags and wear this inside out for a different look. i am worried that excess pilling will be an issue so i will update my review if the quality deteriorates beyond a simple lint shave.
other This trench coat is the best fit and feel-true to size and cozy! excellent material!
other This is a beautiful top! extremely classy. looks great with dressy trousers or jeans. drapes very nicely. the petite medium fits me perfectly (5'other 126 lb). love it! the embroidery ads so much. so pleased with this purchase!
other Ag jeans have become my favorite and these didn't disappoint. ridiculously comfortable! i think they run a tad big, but maybe not enough to size down. just enough to where i'll need to wash them more often, maybe.
other This dress has style and a delicate balance between design and the beauty of the material.
other Per the other reviews i sized up and got the medium. it was still tight around the girls (and i'm not that well endowed), but too big in the armholes. the fabric is a kind of thin tee shirt material. i kept it (because i'm lazy) but not sure how much i'll wear it given the strange fit.
other This twist front top fits true to size, it is perfect! i really love the ruched sides, i like a longer tankini but most of them the stomach area is too wide and flowy. this one is perfect, it hugs your sides and looks great to wear with my kids but still flirty with my husband! i got the navy top and the side tie bottoms in navy/periwinkle and they are so cute together, can't wait to hit the beach!!
other Absolutely love this piece! 5'6 and 120 lbs and ordered a small, fits perfectly. this jumpsuit has become a regular in my outfit rotation, i get compliments every time i wear it.
other This dress is a beautiful vibrant color and a classic fit and flare fit. it does seem to run a bit large, i am 5'0" and 120 lbs. and wore a other petite. it fit nicely and was flattering but still a little roomy. i added a beaded belt to dress it up for my maid of honor duties and despite all the running around, dancing, hugging, buckling the brides shoes and holding my children the lace did not fray and the shape held up beautifully.
other I like this top. it is a nice casual top. i think it looks better on the model because it looks a bit dressy. when i tried it on, it looked good but not as dressy. the embroidery on the side gives the top a nice look. i also like the tie-dye look. the price is high, i got it on sale price. the fabric is a simple t-shirt, the embroidery makes it stand out. i am keeping it.
other Nice thick fabric, lays well. sleeves three quarter but looks great on.
other Most beautiful dress i have ever seen or tried on. i read all of the reviews and it seemed ladies with hips stated the dress ran small. so, after over a year of watching this dress and waiting for it to go on sale, i order a size bigger than i normally wear. i was devastated that it was too large. all sizes except 0 and 00 were sold out, so now i am stuck returning my dress or paying a small fortune to have it altered.
other Unique, sophisticated and versatile summer dress that you will fall in love with. dress it up with heels for a night at the gallery or dress is down with a denim jacket for an easy day look. it needs no accessories. this silk dress is soft and it lays beautifully. you will want to wear it all summer long. fits tts. love it!
other Bought this dress as a winter dress. it looks amazing, and even more so with some boots. love it. also, its more gray than blue, although i like that.
other I've owned a number of pilcro denim jackets it in my day. not because they've ever needed to be replaced, but because i'm obsessed with the fit, the color and the style. when i saw this one i knew it would be no exception! this jacket is even cooler looking in person. the fade on the denim is totally perfect. not too dark, not too light...and not so distressed that it looks sloppy. the denim is soft just like all other pilcro, and the fit is a dream. what i love the most is the interest in the c
3 This top is beautiful in color and fabric. unfortunately just didn't work in the breast line. gapped and there was just nothing i could do to make it hang correctly. i'm not really large in the chest area (38b) but the large just didn't work. had to send it back.
other Great fit, can be dressy or casual, goes with everything, i adore tis jacket!
other Super cute. 5'9" 13other lbs and the medium was perfect to wear with a long sleeve shirt underneath. good quality and lined too. perfect for daytime when a leather moto might be a bit much.
other I tried this on in gray while in store, it was the cuff detailing that initially attracted me. once i tried it on there wasn't a lot i loved about it so it didn't leave with me but now that it's on sale, it's the perfect choice. i'm wearing a medium in the photo, and the only real downfall is how long the arms are on me and i have long arms. maybe sizing down would help but i fear i have too much winter weight to hide to take a small. for reference, i'm 5'6", 14other lbs curvy hourglass, generous hi
other These are form fitting and have a great wash. the size runs large so i would say consider to go down one size than you usually wear. the bottom tapers so they are great to wear wtih flats or can easily fit into boots.
other I ordered this dress and wow , this is one really pretty dress, my only drawback is that the dress is not fully lined. for this price i was expecting a full lined dress. the flower detail and beading is amazing, but this one is going back hopefully it will be on sale soon, i might reconsider
other So disappointed. i love retailer! this was a huge disappointment. i am 5'3" and 120 pounds. when i put it on, all i could think was that i looked just like a clown due to the big cowl neck and how large and round the dress made me look. if i wasn't so disappointed, i might have laughed. this had to have been a design mistake. i've truly never seen something so unflattering.
other I got the navy stripe version of this shirt and it has a very cute nautical vibe to it. i am either an xs or s in antho, and went with the xs for this shirt as i think the s would be too boxy. normally i would have overlooked this shirt as it's rather unimpressive on the hanger, but it was on sale so i tried it on. very cute when tried on! it fits well across the shoulders but isn't too clingy in the body, which i like. the fabric is very comfortable and the shoulder detail gives it a little mor
other The pattern is very adorable. unfortunately the design is flawed. sizing is great at the waist and hip, and the length is spot on, but the top is wide. it's strange because i don't think it would fit someone that was bustier than me either.will return. i'm considering buying again on sale and having a tailor correct it.
other Incredibly soft, great to dress up or dress down. i must have summer tee.
other I love these little socks ? and the dots sparkle. i wear them with my heels and leggings or jump suit pants when i don't want a higher sock or knee-high stockings.
other Love this chemise. perfect blend of comfort and sexy. i bought it in pink, size small. i'm a 32d about 11other lbs and if fit perfectly, i could even probably go to an xs, but i didn't want to wait. the fabric is super soft and the color is vibrant. looks exactly like the picture. decent price.
other I went to retailerplpogie today to try this piece on and it was adorable. i really liked the lace part that lightly shows off the legs. this does run true to size. i am 5'other and 116 pounds and wear a 34b and i was able to button up everything and be comfortable in a size 0. there is no stretch at all with the materials that they have used, so that might be an issue for some. the material was actually a bit thicker than what i would have thought for dress like this, but i really liked it overall and
other These shorts are wonderful! very stylish and easy to pair with my tops. they do run a bit large. i am normally a size 8 or 29. i ordered these in a medium and i definitely could have gone with small. they are machine washable though and i'm not sure if they will shrink at all so i'm keeping them. i would definitely recommend them.
other I ordered the navy in an xl although am generally a medium or large in tops. i sized up because it looked fitted and i think it was a good choice for me. it fits just like the model but the back droops a bit and the neck is wider. my bra is still covered in the back.  it fits perfectly in the waist and the elastic allows for some adjustment in placement. there's other layers of ruffles in the skirt portion. i'm 66 and was concerned it would be too young looking but i love the look. it hits about an
other I ordered this skirt because it looked cute and versatile. when it arrived the pleat in front (shown in the center) was far to the right so the overall look was crooked. not sure if it was a quality control issue or if that's the true design but it will have to go back. too bad because i had high hopes!
3 Well - i was disappointed in the fabric for this dress. it is a heavier material and i suspect will not be very cool / comfortable during warmer weather when i would normally wear a sleeveless dress.on the upside - the pattern is really pretty.
other I love this dress-i have it in the other color (black and white) but now i see this color scheme and i think i may actually like this one better. i love the wider stripes near the waistline which gives it a slimming appearance. the knotted look gives this dress a beachy feel which gets me in the mood for summertime. i love that the pattern is bold, but the color scheme allows this dress to still stay in the casual category and still be insanely flattering. i love that i could wear this dress eve
other I am very happy about the jacket. i like the material and the cut. i was able to wear the jacket for a walk on a rather windy day, about 60 f, with a thin sweater underneath, and it felt comfortable. the fit is very flattering. i would prefer the sleeves to be a little longer (5'7", 12other lb, got size s). also, i wish the lining was full, not just the front detail - it would allow more versatility. but that's just me...overall, i like it :))
other I bought this dress to wear to a wedding and it is a stunner! really one of the most gorgeous dresses i've ever owned. it is very very fancy and really i'd say most appropriate for a black tie event, an evening wedding or a mother of the bride or groom. superb quality... just amazing! i have a few bryon lars dresses and this one seems to run about true to size. the others i own seem to run a little large.
other I love the cut of this dress. i can see how some would not like the way the arms are cut. i love the pockets and the way this dress flows when you walk it it. it's very fun to wear. i am wearing it to an awards show and was a little worried it may be too casual but the texture and weight of the fabric make it look more dressy. i will be getting a lot of mileage out of this dress.
other This is an adorable top. sweet back detail, thin material but soft. the top is two sizes too big, i'm normally a large and a small fits. i know it is supposed to be baggy but the large was inches too big under each arm. size down and petite ladies will be sized out. love this though.
other I tried this dress in store and was in love immediately! i had to special order a petite size, but fits wonderfully. for me, ran a little large. i'm 5'2" and 10other and ended up with a petite xxs and it fits great!
other Shorts don't fit me like they did the first time and i've only worn them twice! the material isn't what is use to be. it stretches out to fast. i don't think i will be buying these again. wish i could take them back.
other I bought one pair last year and two more this year! i love them! they fit tts and the "red" ones look exactly like the picture.....more of a pink color. super cute color! buy these shorts!!!
other I am on an retailer diet but i can't stop thinking about this top! tried it on with my sister when shopping and if only they'd had my size in stock i'd have been a goner for sure. it is super comfy -- the fabric is somehow both lightweight and structured. while i'm kind of sick of high/low, this one manages to execute in a really subtle way that just manages to hide the bum without being in your face. love the sparkle -- you could wear this to work then out on a date or all weekend long. so versat
3 I was so excited when this dress went on sale.  it is very soft and the print is so distinctive.  it is super comfy but not slimming or flattering at all.  i am a curvy girl,  wear a medium 8/10 and this made me look so wide!  the skirt is quit full,  a small would have fit but the top was tight.  so disappointing.
other I was worried the green might be on the shiny side, but it's not. it's a really nice color for fall and the stitching is gorgeous. like in other tiny tops, this top runs small, so order up a size. in most of retailer tops, i'm a small or medium, but in this, i take a large --- a perfect fit. i'm a 36c. is a little on the pricey side, but got on sale, so all smiles here.
other The fit of these jeans are so great! they look syllish and feel great at the same time. this brand does a fabulous job of creating a jean that feels like you can wear them dressed up and casual. a+
other Bought this shirt on sale. it was super cute in the dressing room, and for the first time i wore it. washed it per the instructions (wash delicate with cold water, lay flat to dry) and it shrunk so much i don't think i'm going to be able to wear it anymore. it was oversized and loose when i bought it, so it shrunk a lot. there is also a small hole all of the sudden, that i have no idea where it came from (wasn't there when i put it in the washer). very disappointed.
other I'm 10mths post partum so my belly is still flabby. the elastic is too tight on my waist. i wish this was looser with a drawstring to tighten. i have to return it.
other To my surprise this sweater is heavy, chic and stylish. its well made and fits tts. i'm looking forward to wearing it. i would recommend this tunic to everyone. it looks better on me than the model.....event though it doesn't look bad. you need curves to enhance the look of this tunic sweater. i really like all the different textures in this sweater.
other I saw this dress in the store, there are actually two different colors for this dress: one is blue/purple/silver, the other one is orange/tan/gold. both of them look very nice in person, especially with the shimmery thread. i tried on the blue/purple/silver one and i found it runs large. for reference, i am 5'2", 34b, 120 lbs, usually wearing a size s or sp in retailer dresses, i found size xs fits me better in this design. the material of this dress drapes nicely, but it is kind of itchy,
other I was a bit nervous ordering this dress because it had so much going on, but i have to say, it's beautiful on! it's stretchy and super comfortable as well. i usually struggle with tight pencil like dresses, but this is stretchy and super comfy! no riding up on me! i cannot say enough good things about this dress, it's just so flattering and i get so many compliments when i wear it.
other Saw this online and went in to try on. fit great and is true to size, but i should have known there would be issues as three out of six on the rack had the sewn in tags were all but hanging by a thread. i bought this for my bachelorette weekend in napa and when i put this on i noticed the straps had a few threads coming out and i thought, better get this to the seamstress as soon as i get home to secure the straps. well, literally five minutes into the car ride to the wineries i noticed the seam
other I debated between the xs and the small..and ended up with the small because it's 100% cotton i probably couldn't probably gotten the xs one. we will see if it shrinks. i hope it does a little. i do wish the retailer sizing was a little more consistent because sometimes the xs is fine.
other Bought this top in black and i love it! fits true to size with arms a little snug but because of the stretch in the fabric it is fine. the top is very flattering and looked like the model. the front is shorter but very flattering! love it.
other The only problem with this top is that it only comes in two colors.  this is a lightweight easy to wear top that surprises you with the cute design details.  it will be easy to wear in the heat of my hometown.  i don't think it is too thin and i won't need to add a camisole.  i am 5'2" and weigh 120 and i got a small.  perfect.
other Not a summer dress even though the photos make it seem like it's for hot weather. the weight and layers and synthetic fabric is very substantial. it is a bit scratchy where there is maroon fabric, but not intolerable. i love this dress but it's beyond a-line, it's a tent. i'm keeping and will wear for fall with a long sweater to flatten the fullness that's seen in profile. for my body type (top heavy, thick shoulders/back/upper arms), i chose the smaller of my size range. definitely size down if
other I hoped i would hate these because i have a zillion pairs of jeans. as i suspected, they're amazing and quickly became my favorite! they have just the right amount of stretch, so flattering.
other Fantastic signature retailer styling with this unique statement sweater. the pattern placement has a slimming look on the front and a rear enhancing look from behind. i've been using the super soft removable fur collar as a scarf and stole for my other outfits as well. the length is almost tunic on me, so it looks great with leggings and skinny jeans while buttoned up. if you choose to remove the fur collar the v-neck is very open, so i keep it unbuttoned when i style it that way. knit fabric is s
3 This was the dress i was most excited about in the new arrivals, but sadly it didn't live up to expectations. unlike the first two product photos, the dress is baggy and empire waisted, and the black trim is the thin one shown in the last two product photos. the dress is slip on with no zipper or tie, and on me there were about 4+ inches to spare at the waist. all in all it felt sloppy, such a shame as i would have loved the original design online.anyhow, i wanted to share photos of the real
other Unfortunately had to return this. i loved it but just doesn't work for my petite size.
3 The quality of the fabric is soft and thick and well made. loved everything about it but if you are ample in the chest, it is snug and does not hang and drape as well like on the model, so you may want to size up. i am sending it back as the fit is not flattering on me for the price. someone with a boyish no-curve figure would look dynamite in it!
other The fabric making this dress is great quality- heavyweight and so soft against the skin. the design is near perfect with an extraordinarily flattering silhouette that hangs just right from the hips with poof or flare. the fateful flaw is in the neckline; a broad boat shape that looks awkward couples with a corset-like torso that acts as a push up bra. not for larger busted woman (34d here) and certainly not suitable for work.
other I like this sweater. i bought it in small and medium because it was 25% off and i didn't want my size to sell out. im keeping the small. im 5'5" and 140 lbs and hourglass. the medium was way too much fabric. its still roomy in the small, but its lush looking and soft and will look pretty with jeans and high boots. i ordered the one in the beige as well but i think the lavender color is prettier in person. i think the beige may wash me out. hope this helps.
other Falls nicely. pretty peachy pink color. darker than pictured. bought sz l, 5'8" 175lbs, am busty. very nice fabric, prone to wrinkles.
other I saw this in the store a few weeks back and desperately wanted it. when it wet on sale, i grabbed it! i normally wear an xs or petite s, but with this one, the petite m was the winner! i am chesty and the top would not have zipped up had i gone any smaller. it is a bit wide on the bottom, and i agree with the reviewer who said it should be a bit more tailored on the bottom. still, with some awesome heels, this is a great summer piece! the lining is great quality. love it!
other These tights are light but at the same time super cozy. definitely cut and sewn as tights and not meant to be worn as leggings -- they're really sheer around your rump. i've worn them around the house with oversized t-shirts and long sweaters. would only wear out of the house with a dress or serious coverage, despite what i thought when i bought them. i wish they were available in a few more colors. worth the sale price.
other Once again, retailer delivers a beautiful, quality dress. i love it! it is comfortable and flattering. the material is light-weight enough that i will be able to wear into spring.
other I bought this in late august and have been wearing it ever since. i love that you can wear it either on or off-the-shoulder. the second option adds sexiness even though the top is flowy, comfortable, and easy to wear. on the shoulder i've even worn it to work on casual friday. the print is versatile, and i like that the fabric has a little heft while still being soft and drapey. i definitely recommend, especially since i notice it is now on sale!! it is generously sized, so i'd recommend erring
other I have been eyeing this dress online for a while but never could justify the price. well, when it went on sale, i couldn't pass up the opportunity. it arrived today and is even better than i expected. very flattering cut, long enough for tall people (i'm 5'10") and beautiful colors. i ordered s (my usual size in retailer dresses, i'm 14other lbs, 36c) and it fits perfectly. this will definitely be my go-to dress for the rest of the summer. i love all my retailer dresses but sometimes find them a tad
3 I really wanted to love this. i kept refreshing the page so that i could order it as soon as my size was in stock. i love the colors and struggle to find cute dresses in natural fabrics for the summer. unfortunately as another reviewer mentioned the cut of the arm holes is strange. it cut my off in the most unflattering spot.
3 These leggings were way longer and darker then appeared on model. they also were see through or beige color when stretched across hip.especially for the high cost, there are much better althleisure leggings on the market.
3 I'm 5'2", weigh 120 lb.. i ordered p6 and found the torso too short. if i bent forward or kneeled down that fabric would ride ride up into my butt big time. the top was a little loose too. i'm 35ab cup. i love the colors and geometric design. sadly i have to return.
other This blouse is so pretty! i love the neck tie which gives it interest and won't look boring on it's own. i'll wear this all-year round. i ordered an xxs which fits perfect.
other The quality and fabric of this dress are lovely, but unfortunately i found it to be very unflattering and shapeless. it fit me like a sack, i ordered the m and i suppose i should've sized down, but even in the s i'm afraid this would be far too large. for reference, i am 5'7 and 13other lbs. i have a curvy build so this shape dress just wasn't right on me. i imagine it will look cute on more of a boyish figure. returned.
other So soft and comfy.  fits great, love the length.  i am sure it will get much wear, great addition to my wardrobe.
other This kimono is beautiful! pictures definitely do not do it justice! i love the details of the beading and sequins throughout. the only downfall is that they can snag and get fall off quite easily. delicate but still my fav kimono ever.
other Love this dress so much! i bought the cranberry color first, and i loved it so much, that i also bought it in black. i think it runs fairly true to size. i am 5'3" and about 110, and the xs petite fit perfectly. i tried the xs, and it was pretty large on my frame. i love the fabric and flow of this dress, and i love the pockets.
other This dress is very cute and screams summer. the stripped skirt adds dimension. true maxi length. effortless and fun!
other Tried in store today and found to fit tts. images are accurate in terms of color and showing that there is a tiny bit of sheerness to this (as you can see near the bottom in each photo). i really loved everything about it except that it flared out a bit on the bottom in a way that i'd probably fuss with too much. id probably buy it on sale, but not before that.
other After reading the reviews, i ordered this dress in an xs and sp. i'm 5' 3" and 120 lbs. the xs was too long and too big on the bottom while being too tight in the chest. the sp fits perfectly. i'm wearing this to a wedding and know that i will get lots of use out of it for many different occasions.
other A great basic t, so very much cuter than most. i have black and white both and wish it came in more colors.
other I purchased this top in white. it is see through so i wear a tank or cami underneath. i usually wear xs or s in retailer tops and in this one, i purchased the xs, but wish i had bought a s. the problem is the top is just small enough to pull slightly between the top two buttons. for reference, i am 5'6, weigh 128 lbs, 34b bra size, 28 jean size, and small boned. i currently carry most of my weight in my hips and waist. my normal weight is 110-11other lbs and i add this to point out that i am out of sh
3 Runs really big. i usually wear small and this was falling off my shoulders. very comfortable and soft material. also looks brighter in pic than in person.
3 I was looking for a shirt of this style. i thought it was very cute, but it is not "red' as advertised. it is really a brick orange-y color, which is definitely not what i wanted. very disappointed. sent it right back.
other Classy tunic can be worn with jeans or leggings. neckline is small but stretches so it goes on easily. color is perfect for spring. my only word of caution.....the design can add a bit of bulk around the middle so probably not your best bet if you are tummy conscious.
other A lovely, soft material with a subtle aqua pattern. i'm very fussy about seams that fit my waist, and this one fit perfectly.
other I love this skirt!! i'm trying to find the perfect place to wear it :)
other This dress is like a piece of art. absolutely beautiful on. i wore it to a charity event and received several compliments. it's just so gorgeously different!
other Cute and great fitting pant. love the pattern and it fit tts for the brand. i normally wear a 10/1other and i took at 12. flattering.
other Lightweight, soft cotton top and shorts. i think it's meant to be a beach cover-up but i'm wearing it as a thin, light-weight summer outfit on these hot hot days. the top has a loose elastic around the bottom which i didn't realize when i ordered it, but i like it and it matches the look in the photos. and the shorts are very low-cut - don't expect them up around your waist. again, i like that. some might want to wear a cami underneath because it's a thin cotton but i'm fine as-is. i bought it i
other I'm 5'other and curvy body shape, bought size 6 because i want it to be a bit loose, turns out i could go with size other too, beautiful detail, and amazing fabric. this come with a crop tank top to go inside the lace blouse.
other Love the simple non-fussy style of this dress. note that the color is not ivory, as described and expected (not the first time retailer makes that mistake), however i still found the oatmealish-warm beige color to be flattering to my skin tone (warm tones look best on me). like that the shoulders are covered while still feeling sleeveless, gives it a dressier feel. the fine texture is lovely. this does drape up top, while the bottom clings a bit, but not overly much for me to feel immodest. i am 5
other Fabulous colors, great fabric, super comfy and extremely versatile. i love, love, love this skirt. although i'm only 5'1", the regular other was still above my knee so it might be a bit short for really tall gals. the waistband is a bit wide, but with a cropped top or tying a button down as shown, i found it very flattering. love the texture of the fabric and the slightly retro print and it doesn't seem to wrinkle (after getting out the original packaging creases). it honestly goes with everything a
other I chose to ignore the other reviews saying this shirt was too wide thinking that my wider shoulders would fill it out, but that's not the case. the shirt is adorable and soft and cute on, but just too wide around the armpit/chest area and with the horizontal stripes it just didn't look attractive. i would love to try the next size down to see if it works, but the black and white xxs is sold out so back it went. i am only 5'4" with a shorter torso so the length was fine for me.
other I saw this top at my local retailer and instantly fell in love. i didn't even try it on first because i just "knew". when i finally got home and tried it on, it didn't disappoint. ultra feminine and sexy at the same time. the delicate high neck, coupled with the exposed cut in shoulders really sold this for me. then, you come to appreciate the beautiful sewn in flowers. loved this one....so much prettier in person than online.
other Great shirt. i couldn't picture the material but it's washable and great for hot days when you want to look styling.
other I loved the design and look to this shirt, but it ran way big for me. i loved the forgiving fit, but it just wasn't flattering at all. i even went down one size and it still was huge. sad to send this one back.
other Comfortable, thick material ( think: structured sweatshirt material) easy to throw on and look as if effort was made - when it wasn't. sizing. i'm between a large and xl usually. large was perfect. i'm tall and curvy: ( 36g curvy) and this cardigan/ belted jacket/is very flattering.
other I purchased these in taupe, mint, and coral. they are extremely comfortable and soft. they can be rolled up to 3 different lengths. i stayed in my regular size and the fit is great. i can see why they sell out so quickly. a must for summer season.
other The top i received was large, really long in length, pockets in the front along the seam, and lots of volume in the back without any princess seams to give it shape. the id #'s matched, but that's about it. returned!
3 I tried this blouse on in the store and chose not to purchase it. i did not think the fabric or design warranted the price point as it felt a bit cheap and there's not much to the design. it is true to size - my usual size other fit well enough. i'm on the tall side with an average bust and i did not find it short. my friend was shopping with me and she thought it looked maternity on her as she is thin but very well endowed. she also thought it made her shoulders look broad. personally i liked it on
other I disagree with the other reviews...the colors on this dress are great. bright against the black and the studs are super cute. and the ties at the cuff are a cute touch. fun dress. i think it's as fitted or not as you want. drives me crazy when people get hung up on their "size" to judge clothes. go up or down if it doesn't fit the way you want. i like it to flow a little so i sized accordingly.
other I love the deep v - very flattering. bummed that it's made with polyester, but it's light and easy.
3 I loved these pants.they are so comfortable. however, after just wearing them twice, the threads of the leaves are fraying, and leaving lint on whatever i sit on. the leaves at the seat of the pants are now slowly disappearing. this after wearing twice to work! i imagine after a few more wears that the leaves at the seat of the pants will be close to gone, or at least much less "white" with threads then the rest of the places. this is super unfortunate and will be returning. too bad, they were l
other The tunic is very pretty! when i visited antho store, i was just fallen in love with it. i purchased purple one because the color is for fall. this is good for straight and slender body type.please purchase it before it is gone!
other I tried this in the store and i like it - nice and soft, good basic design that will pair with many pieces. but i decided to wait because of the price. i'm sure i would get a lot of use out of this top, but ultimately it didn't thrill me enough to make it my top priority purchase. i bought a sweater that was on sale instead. still, a very nice top. i may buy it eventually, especially if it goes on sale.
other I wanted to love this as i love holding horses but it fits weird, slender in arms but baggy in the torso. i will be returning
other Like other reviewers, i tried on a medium and a large as i usually take either size in retailer dresses. the large was huge on me - i had an extra 6 inches or so on each side. the next medium that i tried on could barely fit over my head! i looked at the tag to see if i had picked up an extra small but it stated medium. got another medium and it fit perfectly. however, the cami underneath one medium was again teeny tiny. the other medium was ok. you may have to try on a few dresses to get the righ
other I ordered this in the blue motif and the print is really fun. the orange is even brighter in person. at 5'8" 130 lbs the small has more than enough room and is a bit longer than some of the other offerings lately.
other I love this suit, and have gotten so many compliments on it. i weigh 106-108 lbs. and ordered a s. typically i order xs but am glad i went with the size up. the coloring is beautiful. the legs are high cut / flattering. the top has no padding, and shows a seamless result. highly recommend!
other I recently purchased this cardigan and got so many compliments the first day i wore it.  the detail is so exquisite, it will be worth every penny.
other This product is amazing. i love that it's comfortable and stylish at the same time. i love the unique color pattern and the length of this product. i also love that i can wear to any occasion and can dress it up or dress it down. it's very versatile and i love it.
3 I was so excited to try this on--but this was a big nope for me unfortunately. i ordered both an xs and s (i normally wear a s), both hung horribly on me, they were just too big. i love a boxy, oversized silhouette but this sadly didn't flatter me in the least.
3 The shade of orange was quite muddy and not vibrant like photos show. it's going back .
other Easy breezy top that goes with so many outfits. i am petite (5'0'', 115lb), but like the longer look of a top, so went with 4r, thought that the arm holes would be too small if went with 2r. there is a lot of excess material around the sides...and back. i was tempted to return, but the armhole issue prevented me and it was so cute, i kept it. i think it will go through the a few seasons (seattle is unpredictable weather-wise...) and can be easily layered. i like the blouse...but don't love.
3 This top may be right for some, but it did not work for me. i've been looking for a nice black top and loved the flutter sleeves on this one. however, it didn't do much to flatter my body. i ordered the xl, but it was huge. i'm not sure a l would have solved my problems if it had been available. i found it looked boxy and and agree that the arm holes are too big. the quality is great and style so pretty, though. i wish it had worked for me!
other Love the nautical vibe, perfect for summer wear. the knit top with cap sleeves is easy to wear and not clingy for those with limps and bumps. the asymmetrical skirt has a flare which again makes this dress easy and comfortable to wear.  i'm usually a size 8, 36-29-40 and the medium fit my hourglass shape perfectly.
other It is one of the best dress for the season. light, nice color, elegant, can not find more word of it. really great buy! this brand has very special design that really amazed me recently. just want to give a+ to the designer.
other This top is well made and fits me like a glove. i am only 5'1" but have a very muscular build. the xs fits perfectly--slimming around the torso but roomy enough in the shoulders and arms. the fabric is a nice upgrade from typical flannel.
other I don't have anything like these pants so was thrilled to purchase the coral. i found the pants ran slightly large, though i stuck with my regular 28" and they are very comfortable.
other Lovely drape and design. true to size. more of a muted crimson/brick color.
other These jeans are perfect in every way. the rise is perfect, the stretch is perfect. we need more washes in this exact fit. i wish there was more consistency between pilcro denim washes of the same style!
other This green dress seemed more fitted and tailored on the model. i ordered a small and medium in the green and mint (even though it says mint, it's a grayish blue). usually i'm a medium but even the small seems a bit big. it fits more like a loose boho dress rather than how the model wears it. the colors are vibrant and the embroidery is nice. i will be keeping both colors in small and just have to accept that the fit is similar to a looser casual summer dress. if you look at the pics that other c
other Very very boxy design/cut. try on first or buy knowing you are 90% likely to return. beautiful skirt but if you don't have the right body type/measurements, will not flatter you at all.
other I can tell this is will be a "go to" shirt this summer. simple lines, yet a little "different" style - soft stripes, slits on the side seams and short, but not too short that it bares the stomach. it will look great with jeans, dressier with slim white pants or skirt or a pair of nice shorts. i don't usually go for button-down shirts, but this one was a bit unusual and caught my eye immediately. the fabric is soft yet holds it's shape.
other I was nervous about this dress due to the reviews saying it was odd and the colors being different. but these weren't issues for me. the color is navy. it has the loops at the sides of the dress to hold the belt on, but it also has a loop in the front center of the dress, which i think is nice, no one likes a limp bow ;) the belt is nothing to write home about, but it ties the dress together nicely.the front pocket is different, but i really like it. i had a hard time conceptualizing it before
3 This top has gorgeous embroidery, very very nice, looks good in both wine and grey. it runs large. i kept it around not sure whether i should keep it. i usually wear xl, i ordered l and it still was loose at the bottom but fitted at the top. i have a big bust, and the embroidery ended at the top of my bust making the entire look unflattering, because the bust juts out in a strange way below the embroidery. the arms also tend to look wider due to the style. i don't like the fit at all.
other This is very cute and well-made, but unfortunately for my coloring and hair, washed me out a bit. the attention to detail is fabulous and it is a great layering piece for spring. tts but definitely longer as is shown in picture on model.
3 I am a true to size other and when this bathing suit arrived it looks like it's a kids 4. i will exchange for an 8 and hope for the best. the quality looks great and the styling is beautiful but i could barely get into the suit.
other I loved this the minute i saw it in the store but left without buying it.  i called the store an hour later and asked them to hold it for me so i could get it the next day. :)i love it.  it's still a little too warm to wear it in nyc yet but i will soon. i'm thinking 40-50's is the perfect temps for it.  i rarely say this but i don't think the photos of the coat above do it justice.
other This was such an adorable print that even though it was a bit pricey i decided to splurge! alas, the fit just wasn't good. it didn't look good on me and bunched up in all the wrong places. sadly, i had to return it. i've bought swimsuits from seafolly before and recommend the brand due to the high quality, unfortunately this particular style just didn't look that good on me.
other Perfect for when you're a guest at someone's home , having guests or just lounging !  prettiest set you'll ever own... you'll feel as if your on vacation even if you're not. i wouldn't travel without this set !! highly recommend. love.
other I just received this in the mail today! fabric and construction are beautiful and high quality. my only concern was that it ran short on me all around. i am 5'2, 100lbs, 32b, 2other waist, 33 hips. the dress was an appropriate length all around but ran very short in the arm holes, the back cut-out, and the waist. i felt like i was trying to wear a little-girl's dress (and i tend to be short waisted and long-legged as is). i may exchange it for a regular size because it is such a beautiful dress!
other This is simply a fabulous dress. i think the issue with the other reviewers is that they are too small (though there is nothing wrong with that). i am not. i am older and heavier, and the dress fits very well. i'm also rounder on the bottom so it is not baggy or tent-like. the material and texture of the yarn is soft and comfortable. you can wear it all day at the office and into the evening. it looks great with a jean jacket, for example, and booties. and it also looks terrific with flats. it d
other I got this for my daughter (teen) who had been wanting this plaid look but didn't want to look like a lumberjack! this is feminine and can be dressed up or down. it has the high low look that she loves and it is comfortable and machine washable! she will get a lot of use out of this purchase! new item but black friday discount! yay! purchased in red color.
other I almost never buy anything full price here and usually wait patiently for a sale + promotion :) however, this really struck me and i decided to buy it, telling myself it's an investment piece for years to come. it's just so unique and beautiful -- the things that makes retailer unique that aren't as common anymore.____________pros:- very comfortable. i was skeptical because it's all polyester, but it's light and thin and breathable. it feels wonderful on the skin. the lining inside is ver
other Really soft and roomy. very comfortable. just hope it washes well. nice alternative to the regular turtleneck. i wanted it in both colors neutral and green. unfortunately, the neutral did not work for me.
other I saw this skirt online and had to have it. as another reviewer mentioned, the color is more of a yellowy ivory. the skirt is very pretty, but also has a very thick/heavy satin polyester lining. i don't feel like i could wear it during the summer because the thick poly lining wouldn't breathe. that was the deciding factor and sadly i'll have to return it.
other Not tissue thin like most tees and easily can be dressed up to wear to work in a casual setting. i find myself reaching for this tee weekly! have every color! i usually avoid stripes however this tee seems to flatter and slim! love!
other This is a beautiful swim suit! the overall look is lovely; the ruffle is sweet and the low-cut front keeps it just the right amount of sexy for a one piece. i didn't keep it only because i would have preferred the leg opening to be cut a little higher. otherwise, it fit very well. i'm 5'10" and 150, with broad shoulders and a substantial rack (nursing a baby right now) and i didn't have any problems with support. great buy!
other I got this in the floral print before it sold out, and i have never received so many compliments on a dress! it hangs so nicely and is so flattering. the neckline doesn't bother me at all (i know some reviewers mentioned that), but i am a very small busted woman so maybe it has something to do with that? i find it super comfortable, like wearing a nightgown. i am so in love with this dress i just ordered it again in black. it will be a summer staple. i found it runs true to size (i'm 5'3", 11other p
3 I read the reviews and everyone loved them so ordered them online. for me, they are a no. i thought the fabric was cheap and the quality not so great compared to typical retailer items.
other Material is heavier so maybe not for summer months, but fit & feel great. love that they fall beyond the knee where other leggings can fall just below the knees and be uncomfortable and restricting which makes no sense for "active" wear.
other The print is awesome !
3 Super large and a very weird cut.  the sides were much shorter than the front and back and this just looked awful on me.
other I would not recommend these pants if you have a curvy or athletic figure. these pants seem to be cut straight up and down. the fabric is not soft, the color is slightly more muted in person, and they are not as relaxed as they appear to be on the model.
3 I love this top and the beading is beautiful, but just like everyone else, it was way too large. i normally wear a lg, but the large looks and feels like a 3xl. beautiful but large
other I wanted to buy my usual mp but was sold out and so was normal m. i got the regular l and it fits like a shift dress and does not enhance my curves. it looks like a luxurious knitted sack but i mean that in a good way. it is very comfortable, does not cling, and reaches just below my knees. i do worry about the stretch factor as other reviewers have noted but since i just received it we will see. i do not like the sheer sleeves. i wish i could take them off. i do not like the button loop at the
other I bought this top in two colors because i need more statement tops and thought the colors were different enough for a really great top. i have only worn the ivory so far and love it. comfortable, great style and solid quality so the fringe isn't fraying or falling out.if i could change one thing it would be the itchiness around the neck opening. it's not horrible but it can be distracting and mildly uncomfortable.i am really happy with the tops and can't wait to start wearing the black one t
other I tried this on in store after falling in love with it on the rack. the dress is beautifully designed and has elegant, subtle features. i am normally a 2-other in retailer dresses, but the 0 was the closest fit on me. unfortunately, this dress fit very strangely. the waist on the dress was way above my actual waist, which was unusual given i have a very short torso. it also had a strange fold right around my belly button, which was very distracting. i'll put this all down to my extremely straight and
3 This dress caught my eye online and i had to have it. when it arrived it was still just as pretty as i remembered. beautiful, vibrant colors and a unique oversized floral on a flirty, swishy fabric. unfortunately the cut was really strange. after reading several reviews i went with an xs, but i'm not sure a s would have solved all the fit problems i was having. while everything from the waist down fit perfectly, the arms were cut too tight, the chest was huge and yet i struggled to zip it up. an
other I really liked the dress on line, but, i didn't appreciate how lovely it was until i received it. it fit perfectly, and has a lovely flare at the hemline for a flirty feel. i wear it with taupe colored booties and it is perfect for work and afterwork.
other Great shirt, the material is lightweight without being see through. i didn't find the cut to be all that flattering, but it was a cute enough style and comfortable enough that i wanted to keep it. definitely see it becoming a staple in my closet.
other I bought this online so didn't realize that the fabric at the bottom is very, very stiff. i was expecting something silky, or at least on the softer and more moveable side. the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt. that being the case, it kind of juts out in weird places. the sweater part is very nice, but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture. the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o
3 As much as i had wanted this to work for me, it didn't. fabric is not as soft as i had expected and quality is just bad. i purchased this online (on sale at $29.95) and i had envisioned this to be comfy stretchy and swingy with a flow. i sent this back to the store as it didn't seem fit even at the low price.
other I tried this on in a m - it fit tts aside from the fact that there were super long. very form fitted and flattering.
other Great structure
other I really wanted to like this shirt the quality is amazing and much prettier in person but it is hard to take care of. if you wash it the wrinkles are horrible so it has to be dry clean only. also the back is ridiculously long it looks very odd from the side view.
other I was very excited about this product. when i saw it the pattern was beautiful in the romantic floral and the bottom band looked like the bathing suit was a little longer so i felt it would be good for a large chest. when i received the package i knew instantly it ran small. i tried it on and it barely covered half of my chest. also the band at the bottom is actually very small and not what i expected. the print is just as lovely in person as it is online. i don't even know if sizing up will mak
3 I am on the fence about this top. i like the color but i'm not sure what to make of the style. the top part of it, around the chest and straps is lovely and flattering, but the bottom flairs out way more than i like. the back is longer than the front and it's almost a pregnancy top in how much it flairs. it's also quite thin and flimsy material given how expensive it is, even with the tag sale. the color, pattern and the chest part of the top is nice enough that i may keep this one, but, as i sa
3 I couldn't believe how fast this dress sold out when they were having the fall promotion; they had just put it on the website and it sold out in my size in a matter of hours!  i just received the dress today and really like the practicality of it.  you can easily dress it up or down and it still looks sheek either way.  what i didn't like about the dress was that the material is a little flimsy compared to how it looks in the picture.  i am on the fence regarding if i will keep it.
other Bought this in white and the golden embroidery makes this piece very elegant looking. it is a bit sheer, but with a lace bra definitely very nice. that is the only con, i wish it would be not sheer at all. but it is too beautiful to send it back for that reason.
other Can't wait for the weather to get warmer so i can wear this one. as others have said the material is heavier but i think that's a positive as it is very structured and slimming. i'm a fan of maeve dresses and this is no different!
other I love this duster! i got my usual size and it fits exactly as pictured. the color of the fabric is a perfect neutral and will look good with anything. the knit is open and fairly see-through, this avoids the bathrobe look that a long length sweater can have. bought at full price and i'm not sorry because i bet it will be gone before long!
other This t shirt is very beautiful. i absolutely love it. it is soft and flattering and gorgeous - perfect for work or play. i washed it in gentle cycle cold water. i meant to hang to dry but somehow it got in the dryer with towels. i was heart sick when i saw it in a crumpled ball. but it did not shrink nor wrinkle. wow!
other I love the feel and quality of this sweatshirt. however, because of the embroidery/lace detail on the shoulders, it makes it a little stiff so the shoulders look slightly boxy.
other Saw this hanging in the store. it is cute front and back.  it is flattering as well. i plan to wear under a jacket for work and without a jacket at night.  looks amazing with a denim jacket
other This sweater is a nice addition to a fall or spring wardrobe. it must be layered as it is sheer. i read a review about snagging but i have not had this issue as of yet.
other I really wanted to like this top, just got it in mail today, but unfortunately it did not work well for me because i'm 6 ft tall and the blouse was too short. i like the look and how it feels and i haven't completely decided whether to return it, but here are the issues i have encountered with this top. the blouse is very pretty and has a nice refreshing style with good print and color, very soft too, unusual for rayon of this type, feels more like thin delicate cotton. i got my top in red, size
other This dress may not be worth the full price of $138 but on sale it is one huge bargain! so easy to wear and so incredibly flattering! seriously, i don't know why it's not sold out at this price! it hides all flaws without looking oversized or bulky. i totally disagree with the reviewer who called this dress "sack" like. found this tts. looks great with pumps or flats.
3 Looks great from the front, but from the side it looks like a maternity top.
3 This top is very cute, but i found it runs small in the bust, which is unusual for maeve. i will have to return it. you may want to size up, if you have a generous bust.
other I am obsessed with this shirt! it's sooooo comfy and soft, like wearing a blanket! perfect for throwing over yoga clothes. comfy yet adorable.
3 The picture of this top is misleading. it's more like a tent/ super short dress. i ordered my usual size (l) and could easily get away with a small in this top, if the arm holes were not too tight. i def. need to go down to a medium, and maybe even a petite medium since i'm 5/3. the top is 100% cotton, but there is so much fabric there is no way a little shrinkage would offset the amount of extra fabric. it looks like a tent on. plus, the picture and description make it seem like a normal top le
3 So, this is just the most lovely romper. beautifully made, flowey. very comfortable, until you have to take it off.this is the review i posted on facebook. so, no man i know has ever ever ever experienced the abject terror, or maybe has not shared with me, that moment when you cannot get out of, because it has turned into a straight jacket, that otherwise cute romper. and again, maybe a man invented it!
other These jeans are very comfortable. the distress look is enough but not too much, so it is a nice change to the traditional jeans without looking too worn down.
other My wardrobe craves lush detail-rich dresses like this beautiful maxi.  knowing that the dress is expensive and made of all synthetic fabric, i took the plunge and purchased the largest of my size range.  i've noticed that most indian labels commissioned by retailer fit tighter in my chest/shoulders, so i'm glad i trusted my instincts and bought the 12p as it fits perfectly on my 36dd chest and wide shoulders.  this is not a casual dress--there are sequins, beads and rosettes decorating the bodice.
other I recently bought this is a medium black and it is a perfect fit.  it's a beautiful top and the peplum portion is perfect and long enough for someone with a lon torso.  for reference, i'm 6ft 175lbs and usually wear a 10/1other or medium/large top.  i went with the medium based on other reviews. i  i was lucky to find this on sale.
other I really like this top. i am usually a medium in retailer clothing and so i ordered this in medium. it did not fit right across my chest, the empire part cut right across my breast and not underneath like it is supposed to. i returned the top for a large and it fits just right in that area. other than that this top is light and airy, flowy and pretty. i love it!
other I ordered the blue top. it's great for the hot summer we're having in the southeast this year.
other Love this top. it is a little big through the body/waist, i thought it would be a little more fitted but i still love it. the bow really makes the shirt
3 I ordered this in a medium and although the details/design of the shirt were cute, the "swing" did not work for me this time around. i typically like looser fitting tops, but with this shirt i felt like there was just too much material and made me feel like i was wearing a tent.
other I fell in love with this sweater as soon as i saw it. i was a little unsure what the quality would be like just from the photos, but i went ahead and ordered it and it is even more amazing in person. it's super soft and well made. it's also very warm even though it has such a large open weave. the price is definitely higher than i would normally pay, but this is a piece that will stay in your closet, and wardrobe rotation for years and years. definitely worth the investment. i agree with the pre
other I was happy to see this top come back after being sold out. the cream is a pretty color....not too warm toned. the cut is true to size, although very fitted in the arm hole area. the sleeves rather fitted. the fabric of the sleeves is fairly fragile but should be doable if not overly worn. the chest fitted with an aline cut. rather loser in the back. it is also somewhat see through, although not as bad as some i have tried. overall it's a really great top, but would need to be worn with care. gr
3 I bought the white tee. while the print is nice, the size is a bit too large with the xs looking relatively baggy (i am around medium weight and very short).
other Great, special cardigan. fits like a shrug and a little short but is perfect over a tight fitting sheath. great for broad shoulders.
other I don't know why i didn't pay much attention to this tee (the yellow), but i didn't. i saw it in the store, thought it was interesting and kept on going. then i really looked at it online and suddenly i had a bad case of the wants. so when i was in one of my local stores i asked about it, and no surprise, it was sold out. at the suggestion of my sales associate i tried on a solid one just for the size. although i'm small, i have several tla tees in medium, so i tried on a medium and a small. as
other I am tall (5'1other and 3/4) and mostly leg with a shorter torso so i am always looking for longer shirts to balance my leg to torso ratio. i ordered this in the tan and blue colors in a large and so far have loved both of them. i am typically a medium in tops but tend to get the large for the extra length and have the top altered to fit if need be. however there was no need to alter these tops (making me think the tops typically run small). both tops are sheer requiring a tank of some sort to b
other Lovely sweater that is good with jeans or a skirt. i ordered an xl and my only complaint is that i wish it were a bit longer in the front. i am heavy chested though so that's how most tops fit me. i ordered the gray/black and it's really nice. i receive lots of compliments.
other As in previous reviews, this top can be worn in many ways. it could even be used as a pretty bathing suit cover-up. i like it with my cropped cotton spandex leggings which i have in many solid colors. i plan to wear it unbuttoned with my classic style spandex tanks i have in various colors & prints. the complete look says 'summer' & feels cool & comfy in this warm weather. even hubby loves the look! 5'3", 117#. i bought my usual size small.
other Love it; the bit of stretch in the denim makes it less stiff than traditional denim.
other I love these pants. only wish they i was a little taller, i'm 5'4" and the small is a little long for me.
3 I wanted to love this. i have been looking for a poncho-type sweater for our cold midwestern winters. the cream colored one that i really wanted sold out instantly and i missed the window for the xxsp. i ordered this in the xs/sp (smallest size available). i am 5'1" and 108 lbs with small shoulders. the neck opening is huge. my collar bones and a seciton of my upper back were exposed. this would not keep me warm due to so much exposed skin on my neck, back, and shoulders. i suppose i could get a
other Nice fit and flare style, not clingy at all. i got the grey color, petite large, fits perfect. will wear with tights/boots or booties. lots of color options to accessorize with.
other This is so retailer - pretty in pink, unique design and print. i love origami and i love pink, and this blouse is a perfect combo. i ordered size petite s (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips) and it fits perfectly (the hem falls on the upper hips, just like shown on the model). the top has structure, not too soft and not too stiff. i think the sleeves are very unique and great for those gals who are conscious about their big arms, like me. this top has everything: flair, bright color, unique print, but al
other I love the fit of this dress! the fabric is thick and the shape of it is so adorable. i usually don't like bright colors, but i got it in red and it's just so charming. can't wait to wear it out!
other The embroidery and side zip were well constructed. the fabric holds onto wrinkles and creases, so after a period of sitting, there are several creases pointing to one's crotch area. this isn't too noticeable, but definitely makes this a more informal garment.
3 I wanted a casual but special summer dress and had high hopes for this one. i normally like to try things on as it is difficult to tell fit online. when it arrived i was disappointed with this dress. it is very full in the skirt, the top fit a bit odd, not a lot of shape and not especially flattering. the fabric wasn't very exciting either.  unfortunately this one went back.
other This floral tank looks so cute on. the layered cut is very flattering and i've received several compliments while wearing it. adorable
other This is great soft sweater that is not to bulky looking.sometimes when you have a design like this it looks good off but when you put it on it makes you look like a stuffed marshmallow. this sweater's knit is thin enough that when you add the accents it looks less bulky. wore it with winter white pants and received many compliments.
3 I purchased this shirt with the purple colored flowers. while the cut is fine, the quality of the fabric is not great so the shirt is very see-through. will be returning it.
other I completely agree with the other reviewers this top is easy to throw on with jeans or trousers and so comfy! i'm 5'3 with a 34ddd chest and i ordered in my normal medium which looks fantastic. and if i wanted to i think i could have sized down for a more form flattering look but i love the ease of this top.
other I bought this dress for my college graduation, and it's truly gorgeous! i love the loose, breezy fit, but it did feel just a little bit sack-like on me, definitely more-so than i expected from looking at the product picture, even after sizing down to a small (which was comfortable, and i'm usually a medium). i ended up pairing it with a small belt. really pretty dress, just be advised - leaves a *lot* of room around the waist!
3 I am usually a size other in tops. i am very, very rarely a size 0, so upon reading other reviews of this top i decided to order the other and assumed it would fit the way a other usually does. obviously this is designed to be a loose, flowing top. that's why i wanted to order it. however, the other is simply too loose in every direction. my primary gripe is that the arm holes are gaping and falling at the side in a way i don't think it intended.i do really like the styling and quality, so i am planning on
3 Though the quality is good and the fabric is both sturdy and soft, the cut of this top made this a no-go for me. it's a bit short in front and also boxy, which is emphasized by the dolman sleeves. i ordered the coral color and it was much brighter - almost neon-y - as opposed to the soft salmon color my screen shows. i regretfully returned it.
other I liked this top so much that i purchased it in two colors: green and wine. the top and colors are exactly as pictured online, the material feels great, and they fit nicely. the fit was true to size.
3 The purple/cobalt is a beautiful color. i feel the t shirt material is entirely too thin for the price.
other I love the desi blouse! i got it in white and it's a little more off white than pure white, but it is a great flowy top. the touch of lace across the bust is a nice accent. the only down fall is that the sleeves are a bit puffy, but the rest of the top makes up for that.
other The dress is true to fit and very soft. you can dress it up or be casual with a denim jacket.
other Ignore the nutty negative review because this sweater is beautiful and really looks like a hand knit sweater. the quality is excellent, with two side pockets that are lined. it's really soft and so comfy and thick. just perfect for my southern ca evenings all year long. so comfy you can wear it as a robe!looks just like the photo; i got the m/l and it fits like an extra large, which i like in a bulky cardi.super gorgeous! what a steal at the sale price.
other This is a wonderful layering piece for the office. the material is so soft, like a thick velvet, but not quite. it is cute with a sleeveless body skimming top underneath, b/c it fits loosely. not for 90 degree days, as it is a bit of a heavier summer material. the orange-peach-coral color is really unique!
other These run small in the thighs and behind just like most of the other cartonnier pants. i have four pair of cartonnier pants that are all size 10...which is a size or two up from my usual 6 or 8 in other styles. print is great! fabric is super lightweight and great for summer.
other Gorgeous dress with a slimming pattern and flattering waistband. i would say the bust cups are a little floppy on the medium petite and i have 36dds. like others, i wish the skirt was lined but it's not a deal breaker. tracy reese did a great job creating movement in the skirt and flounce without the bulk. i can wear a little heel but wearing flats makes the hem drag.
other I really wanted to like this dress on me, but it was not to be. the color is one of my favorites, but the dress accented all my problem areas. sadly, i returned it. i'm sure that someone with less substantial hips will look great in it.
other I found this to be a comfortable, stylish, no-fuss look. bought my normal size other (5'7", 128#) in the orange, and it fits like the model. it's a nice lightweight linen and is machine washable, which is always a plus. you can't tell from the photo, but the lace-up portion actually has a bit of fabric in it, so you aren't revealed if it isn't tightly laced ;)
other I found this to fit tts. i sometimes wear petite, but found the petite sizing to be a little off. i have a pretty short torso, but found the petite to be too short. i opted for the regular sizing and got a 6; it fits great. this top is great for work (styled with a cardigan or blazer) or for play. i can see it dressing up or down very easily.
other I have been on a search for a dress with sleeves that cute enough for date night. as a bigger girl than most retailer reviewers, i was happy to find this covered my ample chest and between the crosswrap and a little flare in the skirt it camoflauges my belly. it is a sweater dress, which is not easily noticable in the web photos, and can certainly be dressed up for a dinner or for the office.
other Out 6 items i purchased online, this is only one that made the cut. it's super soft and cute on. the only thing i didn't like was the cute lining is attached by buttons, but it needs more attachment points to keep it from showing. i'm going to fix that myself, but i hate sewing things that i purchase. so it lost a star for that.
other Super flattering fit. i am generally a large, large, and the medium of this shirt fit really well. the drape of the fabric was very forgiving of my tummy. great look. also my other year old son loves the colors and flowers!
3 I was hoping to love this tunic, but it isn't what i was hoping for. the material is cute, but the piece itself is a little too baggy and just doesn't do anything for my shape. just made me look boxy all around. it felt more like a poncho than a tailored tunic. unfortunately, it has to go back.
other This initially caught my eye online and then i immediately tried it on when our store received it. the dress is simple and well structured with a tight sweater weave that almost has a" hold u in" feel. therefore, it fits like a glove on!!
other I usually wear either an xs or a small and i went with the small because i wanted it flowy and long because i am 5'9. it is a great fit, but it is a little sheer. i will probably have to wear a cami underneath.
other I liked everything about this tunic except the way that it looked on me. the fabric was great - not too heavy, not too light. the design was cute and i loved the colors (i got the yellow). it was cut well, and a good length for me (i am 5'2"). that being said, i am curvy and i felt like i looked even rounder in this top. if i was 6-8" taller it probably would have been perfect.
other I wear this top all the time! perfect with jeans and can't wait to wear with a skirt in the summer.i am 5'other and have the xs which hits in a great length, just as pictured. i bought at full price, so for the sale price you are getting a great deal!
other I saw this in the store and purchased it right on the spot (didn't even see the reviews until now). i can wear either a small or x-small in retailer but for this top, the x-small was a better fit as it draped nicely and was still very loose on me (i'm 5'4, 12other lbs, 34b). i was worried that the opening was too wide but it was perfect. i like the elbow length sleeves and the fact that the blouse is lined which mean it's not sheer and don't have to wear a camisole. i usually stick with the classics i
other This swing dress is very cute and easy to wear. i ordered the orange print and the black because i couldn't decide. the orange looked washed out against my skin color but the black was a keeper. i am usually a small but ordered one in the small and one in the extra small since it is a swing dress and they usually run large. the top is mostly the same fit so i think i may keep the extra small. even still there is a lot of extra fabric. the rayon is a little on the cheap side but it is so comforta
other Great boyfriend style jeans. run large, though - i had to order a size down.
other This dress is gorgeous. it is somewhat fitted but i didn't find it to run small. i am top heavy 36d and usually wear a size 10, but i bought this in an 8 and it fits me great. i will say the zipper is a bit tricky. at first i thought the dress was too tight but it turned out the zipper was stuck. after fiddling with it, i realized the dress fit but the zipper was a bit tricky. i wore it to work and got so many compliments. also the picture makes the background look burgundy but it is mostly blac
other I found this dress to be very short waisted, much closer to an empire waist than shown in the picture. it was also an inch or two longer in the skirt than other maxi dresses i've gotten from retailer. it really could have used those inches above the waist. just a strange fit overall.
other I purchased an xl and am 5'8"tall. the pants fall near the ankle just like the pic. i plan to wash on my gentle washing machine cycle. the texture fabric print will pair well with any printed tops you choose. these lounge pants are great for everyday wear especially for errands in town. so much better a choice than yoga pants which to me look ridiculous when wore in public. so ladies, please leave your yoga pants for the gym and treat yourself to these casual, comfortable pants. i have two pairs
other I love this kimono, it's so soft, very beautiful and delicate. so flowy just like picture... gives your outfit such a beautiful addition!
other I love the way this loosley falls and is so light you barely feel it on you. it is very sheer to you need to wear another tank underneath.
other I'm not petite, but i am short at 5'3 and while these fit in all the right places, the leggings are about 5-6 inches too long. i'm still deciding whether to return or hem - but the hemming would have to be professionally done with this material. bummer.
other I love these pants! they are slimming, can be easily dressed up or down, and they are super soft and comfortable.
other This windowpane coat is so striking -- and it looks even better on than in the photos. i love it!! it has great styling, including the button placement & the beautiful fall brown lining. it is quite warm over a thin sweater, the fabric is amazingly soft. i get a lot of compliments on it! two friends have already purchased it. i normally might take a 12, but a 10 was just fine. this is a great coat!!
other I bought this in the sky color (and sized down from my normal medium) and absolutely love it. i don't think it's boxy at all. on the contrary, i love the way it hangs (i don't find it to be short either, though i do tend to layer with a longer cami underneath). p.s. the ruffle detail is precious!
other I love this dress but it definitely runs big. i bought a size small and i'm between a other and a 6 and will have to return for an xs. the top feels like it will fall down and i'm a size 34c
other Nice, thick material. cream has lining underneath which i appreciated so that it's not sheer in the light.  flattering design
other Fits well, super soft and very flattering. great for layering and for dressing up or down. highly recommend!
other I have a long list of criteria for this sort of a top. the lace can't be too fragile, the top can't be too see through, it can't bind my arms in an uncomfortable way and it can't be dry clean only. the stars have aligned on this one! i bought my usual size other and it fits tts. i only wish it was a little longer but i will probably wear it layered with a long cami. it certainly seems worth it for full price.
other These tights are so cute and can add some fun to any outfit. i paired with a mustard mini, denim shirt and desert boots! they do run small. i am a size other and had to get the m/l
other This lovely number met all my expectations. ordered an xl, and glad i did. the fabric and styling has flattering drape and it can be dressed up or worn for a casual night out. if it was available in another classic color, or a subtle neutral pattern i'd probably purchase a second one (hint hint retailer).
other This shirt is incredibly comfortable. the material is so soft, and it fits so well. i am 5'6" and 130 lbs with a 32b chest and i purchased a small - it is large on me, and i would have preferred an xs, but the small is just fine as well! it is a great shirt, especially for an oversized henley. 100% recommend. (one star off for the larger sizing.)
other I loved this dressy ruffle sweatshirt. i am long waisted and these often look too short on me but this one fit perfect and actually accentuated my curves in a good way as opposed to making me look "puffy!"
other Big bust, smallish waist... this top is so cute and flattering! absolutely love it
other I'm going through a blouse phase, and this was exactly what i wanted. i'm not svelte, and blouses rarely hang off my frame in a flowy flattering manner, but this one is perfect! it is just loose enough and just form accentuating enough that it looks amazing! i am petite with broad shoulders and a large ribcage/short torso, so flowy is a tough one for me.
other I originally bought this for myself but it was way too big on my backside since i don't have much "junk in the trunk." i decided to pass it on to my sister since it was just too pretty to return. it fits her much better and she's worn it on a few occasions. it does run larger and the pants are very long. definitely have to be either hemmed or always worn with heels.
other Got this other days ago and have worn it 3 of those days. it is a perfect, beautiful autumn dress. the fabric is textured and slightly color-varied in a way that gives the black a more charcoal depth. the fabric is a thin sweater knit -- because of the texture it looks thicker than it is and i had hoped it would be thicker but i actually think if it were thicker it would not have the movement it does, nor would it be as figure-flattering. despite its thinness, it is still warm. would buy this in oth
other This dress is unique and lovely! it is a one of a kind dress. i found it to be true to size. the only downside is the quality of the buttons.
other So cute, warm and fashionable. i ordered a size down and it fit like i was in a sausage casing. gave that size to my daughter and i will order my usual size. the arms are small and the rest is true to size. love the quality softness and style of this. with a hood, for the win!
other This is my third dress-the first one was the right size, but the plaid fell on the dress in an awkward way. the second one was a size too small, but this one is perfect! i am wearing it with a belt and loving it!
other I was really wanting a nice white summer blouse to pair with patterned skirts. unfortunately, this fell short as it was huge. not only was it big, it flared at the bottom. it would be perfect if i was sporting a baby bump, but not what i am going for right now. if the tank was a bit slimmer i would have kept it as a tunic.i'm sad that i'll have to return it.
3 I really wanted to love this dress! the quality is great, and the overall look is so lovely. however, i tried two different sizes (petite s and petite xs) and it still looked too baggy/big. the upper part is wider than it appears. also, the photos shows the bottom two buttons buttoned up. however, the dress doesn't actually have any loop holes or button holes, so it just hangs open. very sad to have to return both dresses.
other This was about to be my first retailer splurge item, but i think i'm not there yet. for the rich price tag, these pants weren't going to be versatile enough for me. they're very light weight and even translucent in sunlight. perfect for a small subset of my days but not going to make the cut for casual friday. that light patch near the r knee is also a pocket- tended to flap open and look about as nonsensical as it is. if you're already on this level good for you! i had to send these back.
other This dress is flattering, but size up. tight through chest in my normal size.
other I disagree with the other review. i purchased the xxsp in navy and i think the sweater fits true to what is shown on the retailer-model. the sweater knit is lighter weight, it is not heavy. it fits more tightly to the body, which i like. the material is soft to me and navy color has a gray-tone to it. i did not find it difficult to wear the sweater off of the shoulders at all. if you are looking for a heavier sweater this is not for you. if you do not want a body skimming sweater this is not for y
3 I wanted to love the stress so much i mean who doesn't love polkadots and a good maxi! unfortunately the fit was too awkward. the bust is saggy and the waist seems to poof out
other This dress is gorgeous!!! i love it! i bought it to wear to a july wedding. i got the navy and it is so fresh and crisp in color. the sizing is on spot! i slipped it on and it was comfortable, easy and stylish. i am 5'7" and typically xs. it falls exactly as portrayed in the online photos. it is lined in the skirt and the top is stretch jersey in the best weight! i am in love!
other Love this top! it is almost universally flattering, and washes beautifully. it is as easy as throwing on a sweatshirt with leggings, but soooo much better! if you are on the fence on this one, i highly recommend you give it a try.
other I love design of this top! it will look beautiful on many body types. the black material is thin, and for my personal level of comfort i will definitely wear a cami under. the details are gorgeous and the neutral colors easy to combine with casual or dressy bottoms. the top ran true to size for me.
other I wish these fit more like joggers, but they are slightly poofier. with the big buttons, i felt a bit too clownish. however, it's a great statement piece if you're up for it. the quality is good and the fabric has a nice texture. i think the problem was that since linen doesn't drape and scrunch like less structured fabrics, so it holds more volume instead of loose, semi-flowy menswear look. i
other Just tried 'layered sadie top' and it felt so nice on. good hand feel for both materials but note that the knit on top is a little too delicate for machine wash but can be hand washed. this item is definitely "vanity-sized". i'm 5'1, 113lbs and the xs looked nothing like how it does on the model. it was flowy as depicted but it came down much lower on me and looked a little maternity-esque. highly recommend because it's gorgeous and well made but i would definitely come in and try it out for you
3 I really liked these jeans initially, but by the end of the day the waist is really baggy. the fabric stretches with wear and takes a wash to get back to its original shape.
other Agree with other reviewers the jacket is better in person than on model very nice jacket model does it no justice
other I saw this top online and loved it. i wasn't sure about sizing and because i don't live near a store i decided to order two sizes. i'm 5'8" and typically wear an 8 or medium in tops. the 8 in this top though was much too tight in the shoulders. i sized up to a 10 and it fit beautifully!
other I normally am a xl or size 18 in fabric tops (if they're not knit and do not stretch.) but, this looked to be a bit boxy and so i bought the 16 and it fit fine. it fit like on the model....tailored, but loose and not really a lot of fabric or boxy.now, the fabric is stiff. and, it's sheer. but, the pockets land where your breasts are. so, i wore this with a nude bra and it's just like in the photo. there are peeks but you don't see anything. however, if this is for work, i'd put a cami under
other Great summer pants.....nice material, easy to take care of. i'm 5'6" and usually wear a size 29, which i purchased the neutral. they might be a little bit loose, but they fit great, and best of all, they truly are slimming. i love them so much that i just ordered the green.......hard to top the sale price
other Very lovely dress!!! perfect in all ways. although i do find it to run big. i ordered the small, and i usually wear a other to 6 in a dress. there is a lot of fabric, but it lays nicely. it's mostly just the arm hole. it's rather large showing the strapless bra. so, deciding if i should size down, if there isn't a huge change in sizing, or keep and have altered.if anyone has tried in both the xs and sm i will watch for comments overall size differences. i have the black and white, and wish now i wo
other I purchased the cedar one. not sure where they got color name from since i don't see any cedar in it. the picture of the model is accurate in coloring and fit. tts, the sleeves are a little wider and longer at bottom but in a good way (to me). the pockets and belt are a suede-like material which makes for a lovely detail. it's not a slender-izing piece but not a frumpy fit imo at all. soft material and nicely made, but for that price i would hope so.
3 The top is gorgeous and bohemian like with a loose fit. the top arrived with a small black stain and some of the lace already ripped. it might be too delicate for me to even exchange for another and wear. i am going to have to return it.
other This shirt is such a beautiful color! the lavender is a really lovely addition to spring wardrobe and goes with more than imagined. it has a bit of an oversized fit although it falls really nicely on slimmer silhouettes. it's also incredibly comfy and stylish with an updated look even to the most casual of attire.
3 The item i received was not distressed. i bought one size larger thinking they'd be super slouchy, but they just looked sloppy. also, the hips puffed out in a very strange way. i wanted to love since they are so cute and soft, but i look like a man with hips in these jeans. returning this weekend.
other This is a classic pencil dress that would be becoming on most straight figures. i always wear a 6 (or medium) in hd, and this dress is a little large everywhere. i love it so much, i paid full price and i will probably have it taken in on the sides if possible. the lacework is gorgeous and sturdy - it doesn't catch on stuff. there is a lot of give to sit and move in, unlike most pencil dresses, and i cannot say enough about the color. wow, heads turn when you walk into a room in this gorgeous de
other I sew and therefore i can tell when something is cut and designed well. this top hangs beautifully and the colors are very pretty. it's cotton.
other I purchased this top in the wine color and found it to be cute and comfortable. the sleeves are not tight which is nice, but it is very short and moving your arms away from our sides make this shirt look a little bit like a tent. the color is pretty and the button detail is nice.overall good purchase, but i'm glad i got it on sale!
other This top is my fun splurge for the summer. it's a little flowy but not over the top. and the quality is great. i'm 5"7, 120lb with really broad swimmer shoulders. i preferred the xs because it was a little bit less flowy on the sides than the s. but the length on the xs is dramatically shorter than s, so i went with the s.
other Looks great! it is more off white/tan then white though
3 I really love the look of this jumpsuit, casual but classy. shapely but comfortable. i'm 5'other and, similar to another reviewer, proportional torso to leg ratio. the legs were longer on me than the model in the picture, but no problem there because they're cuffed.however the arm holes are too big. my bra shows, and the particular one i got came damaged with some of the embroidery coming unraveled on the back. it's also supposed to be dry cleaned and that's annoying for casual wear. returning it.
other These leggings are so thick and soft! they feel like velvet on your skin. i am so, so happy with my purchase, and would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a unique, comfortable, and quality pair of leggings.
other These pants are beautiful and so comfortable. the liner is a nice surprise. they can be casual or dressed up with a jacket. i'm so pleased to have gotten them on sale!
other This dress is awesome - i actually first saw it on lucy lui on elementary and thought it had to be from retailer. sure enough it was and it was on sale. i got the blue and would have gotten both if they had my size. i am usually a m and found this fit true to size. i always love a wrap dress and this with the buttons keeps it from spilling open - love it!
other I wore this dress on thanksgiving with black tights and black flats and it looked great. the dress is forgiving if you're trying to hide a chunky waistline because the belt doesn't go all the way around. it's just in the front so it gives the illusion of a waistline and doesn't look like just a sack. if you have a great waistline, you may not like this! i wish it were a bit longer but with black tights, it looked fine. (i'm 5' 5", no where near as tall as the model, and it was about 2" above my
other The materical is wonderful and light and the color is gorgeous, but the large was absolute gigantic. i'm returning it and sizing down possible to a small, which is unreal, since i wear a size ten normally! i am petite, height-wise, but more than length, there was just so much room width-wise. it swallowed me! the dress itself is lovely, though, so i'm definitely exchanging for a more reasonable size. but definitely size down!
other This dress is perfection it is extremely comfortable and versatile. great for dressing up or down. i am large busted (36g) so was delighted that it stretches as this is a problem for me finding clothing to fit allover. i am petite 5"other with a curvy figure and a regular medium fit great!
other This is such a fun dress to pull out during the summer. it is beautiful and i receive numerous compliments whenever i wear it. also, it is pretty lightweight, so it stays cool.
3 Nice soft jeans, cute style, and i wish i could keep them...they just are too small on me. :/ not sure if i've gained weight (which i don't think i have because i had on a size 28 pair of pants today) but i ordered a size 29 in these jeans and they zipped but just too snug around the waist. i would honestly need a 30 or 31. looks like they are selling out quickly so i doubt i'll be able to get the size i need. if you have a small waist i think they would be fine but they don't fit my body type
other This dress is soft and comfortable. it's perfect for summer. i ordered my usual size other petite and it fits perfectly. 34" 26" 5'1"
other The colors in this cardigan are not what they look like on line. the top is navy and the lower arms are grey. the sweater overall has more punch than pictured. this is a cotton sweater and a great fall layering piece. it will look great with a tee shirt and jeans. it is a long sweater, but not too long as to swallow a smaller person up. i also really like that the front is not too flowy. i am looking forward to wearing this all fall.
other I wore this to an engagement party and got compliments all night. it is absolutely gorgeous and very slimming! i got a petite 4, and it fit perfectly. for reference. i am 5'other and 12other lbs. you ill not regret buying this dress!
other I love this top, it's not too fitted and falls in the right part of my waist giving me good movement. i wear it to work and everyone compliments how the back is longer the top doesn't ride up your back!
other Pretty! can't wait to wear this in the fall. design is understated yet pretty. nice poncho:swing style. haven't worn it yet so i can't rate the durability or wash experience yet. glad i got this on sale!
other These shorts are great! perfect length and this can be addicted based on how much you roll them up. i love all the colors. i've bought several pairs because of how comfortable and versatile they are!
other This tee is such a staple for me. i bought it in the green and it is such an elegant deep emerald. the perfect shade. the shirt has some detail that is not shown - there is stitching/seaming along the side in the front and back that give the shirt a good structure. the shirt also has a great weight to it. the knit is sort of a vertically ribbed knit but thicker than a classic ribbed tank top. the edges of the material are also open, almost-frayed edges. the additional detail on this shirt defini
other The colors are amazing. so vibrant and plentiful. the arm holes are fairly generous but not bad. i think it just adds to the loose fitting nature of the dress. i got a medium.. i'm 170 with a small chest. medium is my norm for maeve. the buttons in the back are difficult, you need help getting on, but getting off you can do solo. this dress makes your shoulders look really good!! it sits in a very flattering way.
other Super cute and flattering!
3 I so wanted to like these pants. i wear a lot of "genie" pants because they're comfortable. the problem with these is that they're too narrow towards the ankle, but the worst is the fabric. its "old lady" fabric. i was hoping for a pair of blousy joggers in a light denim, and this fabric was disgraceful. i knew the minute i saw them that they were going back. i'll keep looking and hoping.
other It stays on .... i mean off the shoulders. the price is shocking, love the low price, but by no means id cheap. really love this little beauty
other I loved this dress and i really loved it more after i bought it on sale. i am 5'3 100lbs and the only thing that bothers me is that the arm of it are somewhat tight when i reach out to get something. other wise the dress is great and get a lot of compliments on it. i paired it with black nylons and black plain leather booties and it looked great!
other I purchased this top in a great sale! fits great,true to size i am xsmall-small for reference, purchased small. i ended up putting a bandeau bra on with it to feel more comfortable. it would be great in the fall with a cardigan/ sweater, or a blazer. super cute to wear alone in summer with jeans!!
other First, this is thermal ,so naturally i didn't expect super sheer, but it is. really sheer light fabric. i like it, but be prepared for considering who you might run into if you walk around the house in it. second, it is large. i ordered the size 0 and it's a nice oversized fit for my 5'3" 12other pounds. i wouldn't want to go larger. along with being sheer, the fabric is easily stretched, which i don't mind in this case. finally, the color. it looks white on my monitor and shows a colorful blue dot
other I bought this dress in a sm for a cruise i'm taking soon. i don't have much of a waist, kind of straight like a board, and this dress is very flattering on my figure. the skirt fits snug and the top drapes nicely over my waist. very pretty and flowy. i bought the multi color stripe dress and the vertical stripes enhance the beauty of the dress.
other The collar from a distance looks like it has seen better days (very scruffy), but it is so silky soft. and the slight sheen to the jacket is a nice twist to an ordinary army type. the fabric is definitely thinner than i expected, but it&#39;s also softer and better for layering.
other This really is a lovely shirt . i like the long length of the sleeves as sleeves are often too short on me to wear cuffed at the wrist. i now have the option of long or rolled up sleeves. the fabric is the perfect weight for indoors. it is definitely a keeper.
3 While the fabric, embroidery and sizing are dead on, i just couldn't deal with the shiny little mirrors that the designer embellished this shirt with. that detail is not apparent in the photographs and i felt lessened the versatility of this blouse. so, it must go back to retailer.
other This top is beautiful. soft and silky and hangs in a very flattering manner. i am usually a 4, but sized up to an 8 to get a little more length. it drapes really nicely. i wear it with skinny jeans and a long necklaces for a casual, put-together look or it can be dressed up easily, too. i'm not sure what the previous reviewer meant about the neckline. it lays perfectly on me. highly recommend.
other This dress is as comfortable as it is adorable. i am 6'2" and usually wear 12/1other but the 10 fit me. love, love, love this dress!!
other The suit is lovely, but it is very long in the torso and gaps at the leg. i was told that it runs small and to size up to a 10. i did, but i do not think the smaller one would have done better. the bust is fake and it turns out when untied. worst of all it emphasizes the tummy. all in all not a good look for me. i am not heavy but i do need tummy support. normally i wear an 8 and in garnet hill a 6. sorry but it went back. i really wanted to like it.
other I love this top! i debated between an xs and a s, but i'm usually an xs in deletta so that's what i got. it fits perfectly and is beautiful.
3 Loved the idea of this top--but it just won't work for me. it's really big. i'm 5'3" and 12other lbs. a small should be fine, but i'm swimming in this. the back is pretty (i tried it on with a white cami), but it looks very maternity on me. tried to order the xs, but it's sold out. too bad. was a cute idea. not too thin for summer.
3 I received the moss skirt today. the material felt very soft and like good quality. i'm 5'4', 12other lbs and had ordered size other regular. unfortunately the skirt was huge and also very long, below the knees. the cut was not flattering for me as the material stuck out very wide on the sides. possibly a smaller size and petite would help but are sold out already in moss. plus i'm not sure the sticking out would be fixed, that might be the cut of the skirt. it didn't work for me and i will be returning
other I bought this sweater in the black. it is so flattering and feels great on. the sleeves are a bit long, but they are supposed to be. the material is not overly thick, yet it feels soft and well made. while the lace sleeves are the star of this show, the back is so flattering! it has a perfect cut that i don't think comes through in the picture. it fits true to size. love this one!!!!
other Just received this and absolutely love it! i tried the vienne cardigan in the store and i assumed this one would fit the same (since online exclusive), which it does. this one though has the whimsical left grey sleeve with trees, a fence and sheep on the sleeve - very cute. it's a traditional knit design with a twist of modern design being the cape style. it is a bit cropped but fits well and the hood lays nicely. there were a few too many stray threads when i received that i needed to cut off.
3 I really like the color and flow of this dress. the dress itself fit well however the slip was extremely tight through the bust. i have a large bust at 34d however most dresses are still wearable especially flowy dresses. unfortunately i had to return this one because of the slip.
other It is a perfect weight and length. it's a great dress. i did need to have the waist altered bc it is a straight fit.
other I really like the soft, flowy satin fabric and vibrant color of this dress! i am 5'5'' 125lbs, the s was too large, so i ordered the xs instead. things to note: pockets, elastic waistband with nice detailing on the sides, slip underneath, and large flutter sleeves. i think that women with smaller torsos should consider petite sizing.
other This is such a gorgeous and unique turtleneck from retailer. my favorite color is the nude and buttoned neck is really pretty. i'm 5'other and 10other pounds and i got the small since i liked the longer length and did not want it too clingy. it is a personal preference but you may want to go up a size. as for the dry cleaning, i washed this on delicate cycle without dryer and it came out perfect. love this!
other Ordered this in white. it is really nice and sexy but very body hugging and unforgiving. perhaps it is my large stomach, but it hugs a bit too much for my liking. yet i think overall the design is very nice so i am keeping it and hoping i can lose some weight in my tum.
other Love all the colors in this skirt and that i can wear it with a tee and flat sandals or a black jacket and heels. easy piece to wear many ways. great quality too.
other This sweater caught my eye while in the store shopping for a gift. i am on the shorter size so i was worried that it would drown me. it didn't! it hits me mid thigh. the sides are cut up high. i will wear a cami or shirt under it. super soft material. flattering fit. i have put on a little weight and this hides all the problem areas without looking frumpy. thanks
3 May look better on someone tall. thin, and straight.
other The sweater is comfortable and has a little 70s fabric flair...not quite as classically modern as it looks on the model. i am keeping it because it is a true fall/spring item. not a fabric weight for summer wear in california. the peach color is pretty muted, so it is not a show-stopping going-out piece.
other One in every fifteen items of retailer clothing fits. this jacket is one. easy to grab and keep chill away. hood snuggles up as cozy collar when not worn up. model in photo must have orangutan arms, sleeves hit at wrist on this wearer with shortish arms.boiled wool fabric is light, which is great for layering. lovely transition fall to winter transition piece. statement jacket that will live on next season and beyond.thank you, rosie neira.
3 I really wanted to love this sweater after reading all the reviews, but it just didn't work for me. the pattern is amazing (almost a little over powering, making it one of a kind and unique) but what i didn't like the color of the knit collar and front bands----it's an old looking mauve-tweed grandpa color. i probably would have kept it if that color was different. it was returned to find a different coat style sweater.
other My new favorite sweater for layering!! perfect color, length and fit. i am 5"4, 12other and purchased my usual small. if you're on the fence about this one i say try it on it's totally worth it!
other This skirt is hot. i love it and would marry it if possible. super pretty. the jewel hem looks awesome. buy it! we can be twins.
other I love this jacket. it has great structure and lays nicely, while still have knit arms and a lining. don't try this on if you aren't prepared to buy it because it's amazing. color is more of an olive than a khaki to me as it appears in this picture. i am 5'5", 135lbs, 34c, and the small fit perfectly. definitely consider this as an investment piece across many seasons.
other Really like this tunic a lot. it is comfortable and easy to throw on and look put together. i'm always a fan of pockets too! i ordered the xs -- i'm 5'4" about 118#. it fits loose but not in a bad way. the fabric allows it to fall well over the body. if you are tall it will probably be too short for you as it was a few inches above my knees. glad to have snagged this right away! more tunics like this please!
other How has nobody reviewed these pants yet?! love them! they're more like really nice, structured leggings, but thick enough to be substantial pants. they're stretchy, hold their shape, flattering on my big hips and thighs, and have no distracting elements like belt loops or protruding pockets like some of my other pants, which makes it hard to keep a smooth silhouette under a longer shirt. the only bad--and it wasn't even really that bad--is that these are longer than the 27" advertised. i'm 5'5",
other I had really high hopes for this dress based on the reviews. i'm on the curvier side, but was surprised to find that my usual size 1other was very loose and long - the hem hit just below my knee. instead of feeling sexy, the weird fit just made me feel matronly. i'm going to exchange for a 10 petite, which will hopefully be a little more figure-hugging and not as long. despite my fit issues, the design is stunning, intricate, and unusual. i'm hoping that the new size will do it more justice.
other I've been looking for a great long, loose, versatile vest for some time, and this is just about perfect. it's slightly heavier than i would have preferred (i'm in a warm climate), but it excels in every other way. it looks so much better on than it does on the hanger, and can be dressed up or down. definitely a steal on sale!
other Omg when i saw this coat in the baby blue i knew i had to have it. i tried it on and fell madly in love! i decided it was the only thing i needed in this world. it is soft and cozy. comfort with an old fashion hollywood glam. its almost sold out already, so grab it if you can cuz its divine! does run a little big, so i got a 0 instead of a other and its perfect.
other Maeve consistently nails pencil skirts - i always know exactly what fabric and fit to expect, and it is flawless! the fabric is soft, lined, and has stretch. it feels as close to wearing sweats as you can in a skirt! the colors are beautiful on this - i'd say in person the colors are a bit deeper and richer than they show in the model photo. length is about the same on me as it is on the model at 5'7" and got my usual s with no issue. this beauty will go with lots of different colored tops too,
3 I wanted to love this dress!! i eyed it for months before deciding to purchase, and when i hit submit, i purchased a size down, given the prior reviews. excitedly, i whiled away the moments until it appeared in my mailbox. as soon as this dress was delivered, i ripped it out of its packaging and ooohed and aaahed over the beautiful lace overlay and the halter cut. hurriedly, i pulled the dress over my head, allowing it to drape over my body. and drape it did, but not in a good way; rather, the d
other This top runs larger so size down. i love it besides that. it's adorable!
other This is a dress for a princess. i admire this dress so much, online and in person. i tried on this dress a few times every time i visited the store. the beads throughout the dress provide a low-key surprise sparkle, especially in the sun. the colors are much more vibrant in person, which is breathtaking against the light cream background. the fabric is soft and flowy. unfortunately for me, it doesn't fit right. size 6 fits well but the arm holes are too big and the midi part makes me look frumpy
other I skipped over these when they first cme in store, but it was reccomended to me to try them on. so i did, and i loved them, they look like a skirt which is amazing but you won't be worrying on those breezy days ;) they run very big!!!! i'm usually a 26/27 or 2/other in pants and i got the xs and feel like i could have even sized down but that's the smallest size carried in store. i got them in the green because i felt that the color went more with the casual feel of the pant. if you are interested i
other After trying several one piece options i decided to buy this gorgeous tankini. i love the fit - bottoms stay put while running around the beach with my girls, but still stylish. the top is a perfect fit- little lining and halter adjustable tie is flattering on a smaller chest. the material is high quality and i will be living in this all summer long. there is about a two inch gap between the top and bottom.
other This is a great top so beautiful with bright colors and sheen. my only complaint was i am dd and it was tight so i had to size up!  otherwise my brests would spill up and out!.
other So much prettier in person than online. the animal print isn't in your face, but subtle enough for almost any occasion. the button-up collar and slightly past knee length make it work for a casual work environment. the pleats and airiness of the dress remind me of kate middleton in anita dongre. fit: 5'4", 140 pounds - i bought a six, but the four would probably work as well. because of the lightness of the fabric, the extra fabric doesn't overwhelm my small frame. goes slightly past my knee
other I was out of town when my coat arrived, and was so excited to get home and try it on!!  i haven't worn it yet, but we've now got the weather for it...and i can't wait!  i'm 5'7" and heavier than i'd like, but the xl fit perfectly!
3 The material is beautiful and as others said its a bit fuller than one might think. i am returning because it's high waisted with a thick elastic waist band. not my style - i suppose it would work with a thick belt. as i said its beautiful - just not my style.
3 Great quality top. i do wish it fit me...i'm really long waisted and this top was too short. had to return
other I bought this tee for the cute print. otherwise, this tee is nothing special. i usually wear an xs, but bought an xxs, based on how loose the tee looks on the model. it's pretty thin and more like a slub cotton. i think i will hand wash it, just in case.
other I bought the xs in green and every time i wear it i get compliments all day. it's a more youthful style than i usually wear but i couldn't resist the dark green color. i wear this with black leggings and flats and it's a perfect dress for a school day.
other I love this top. the quality is excellent. the blouse is lined and falls nicely.. i like to wear it with a pair of dark gray jeans. the color is described as "orange", but it really has more of a bronze tone. looks very rich and exotic. it's perfect top when you want to wear jeans, but want to dress it up a bit.
other I just bought this shirt last week in stores and i love it! it looks different on me. i bought an xs, though i'm 5'8" 135lbs. not typically an xs( though i'm pretty small on top). it's 3/other sleeves on me and tight at my forarms. i love it! it so cute and you can't see in the picture but the design has a tiny bit of shimmer. the detail is cut out but not really see though so i don't feel like i have to wear a tank or anything under it as long as i wear a nude bra. did i mention i love it! i hope i
other I was so excited to receive this in the mail. it fits true to size and is extremely flattering. so glad that i made this purchase
other Wow! i had been looking at these shorts online...then found only one pair left at my store in a size four--a size i can sometimes squeeze into...luckily, these really do run a full size larger without being snug/too tight...$19.9other with 40% off!!!???? yes please,  cannot wait to wear them next summer! and p.s. per above reviewer, you do need need to cut the cross strings at the pleats--they are just meant to keep the shorts nicely pressed/flat in the store, then you are on your own!
other These are fantastic jeans. true to size but know that if you are average height, you'll need to wear heels with these. imo flare pants look much better with heels anyway.
other I've been shopping at retailer since 2007, and floreat used to be my favorite designer, but for the past year or more, floreat mostly misses the mark. this blouse looks nothing like it does on the model. 1. it is long on her, not so in real life. this is probably the worst part about this blouse. if it were not for this, i might try on a size m and give it another chance.2. it runs very large. i usually take a l or xl. i think i would need a m in this, as mentioned above.3. in the picture, t
other I initially saw this sweater in the store and it really stood out. the rose pink color is absolutely beautiful and i love the glimmer band. it adds a beautiful detail to the sweater. the fabric is very soft. the only downside i see, is that lint did get all over the tank top i was wearing underneath. though i think that will change over time as i wear it more. it wasn't a huge inconvenience, which is why i still give this other stars. i am always a small at retailer, which is what i ordered, so
other I really wanted this. they had two size small in my local retailer, both were damaged. so disappointing. i don't want to pay shipping for one that hopefully isn't damaged:( in the last year i've had multiple quality control issues with retailer. makes me gun shy. not sure i'm getting what i pay for anymore.
3 This dress is nice colors and well made but it's just not the style for me. it almost fits frumpy. i'm not sure that a belt would even make it look good. also being 5'8, it is shorter than i'd wear. i like at least touching top of the foot for a maxi.
other Great tank! i really like the black and white striped one! very versatile .
other I absolutely love this dress. i bought this right before traveling to italy for vacation. it was perfect for the hot weather, flows nicely and was comfortable for a whole day walking around. i am usually a small, but this just felt to loose on my chest. i went with an xs.
other Love! the detailing is so pretty! and finally!!! it's a top that's comfortably long. retailer has been making all of their tops so short lately! i'm 5'7" and a dd. i ordered a large simply because it's a cotton tee and i didn't want a fitted look, per se. my only criticism would be that the material is a little thin in the front. i just ordered it in black too!
other The picture of this dress does not do the colors justice. they are a very rich green and pink, which were a popular color combination in the 70's. (i was there!) it adds an authentic touch to this great peasant dress. the black and white embroidery on the bib gives it a modern flair. i am 5'6", 130 pounds, and usually wear a size six in a dress. the small fit perfect. while the dress is billowy, the square on the back pulls it in, so it doesn't fit like a tent. perfect for boots now, sandals lat
other This is a very cute top. i am 5'4'', 170lbs, 34dd, and a large fit great. it fit perfectly in the chest, but the top is meant to be baggy at the bottom and long (it covers my bum). looks very cute with skinny jeans. love it!
other I love this top. i'm not one to iron, so i wash (and hang dry) and wear it. great with skinny jeans.
other This top is very cute and is made out of soft material that isn't clingy at all. and you don't have to be stick thin for it to look good. i don't like to show my arms normally but this top is very flattering all around. i love it!
other I just received this and absolutely love it !!! i love cold shoulder designs and this one is unique and so well made. i am usually a size small and it fit perfectly. i would say it runs true to size and will look perfect with white or black pants and a cute sandal. i am so glad i got it. love the quality .
other Love this top! kept looking online, but really wanted to try on. so once i made it to a store, i was so happy they had my size! i'm 5'1", but prefer regular sizes in retailer for the length. i got the xs and it is a lovely fit, tts. love the colors in the pink top!
other I agree with the other reviewer who said there was too much hardware and such. this really does have a lot going on. i usually wear a other in skirts, and based on reviews, went up one size. it still saw way up near my chest - i think even an 8 would be too small! it's sooooo tiny at the waist. probably buy other sizes, other and 3 sizes up from your own. also, the skirt flares super wide at the sides, it doesn't sit the way in the photo or maybe the model is holding it down with her hand. it's like a skirt
other These jeans are so great, i'm thinking of getting a second pair for when the first wear out, despite the price. they hug my curves and make me feel like a bombshell. the fabric and stitching is all good quality and sturdy - these are comfy but they definitely are not thin like legging jeans. love them!
other This dress is just as it looks in the pictures. shapeless. the trick is to add some styling to it. add the pilcro dark denim jacket and the headwaters scarf, and your all set. i had on black seychelle loafers but would pair it with a black d'orsay flat. the top blue of the dress is a faded sun washed looking navy and it goes well with the black of the skirt. i usually wear a other in dresses and the xs in this dress fit well. i'm 5'3ish", 118#, 34d-dd. this is going to be a nice winter to spring dre
other I don't love this dress but i really like it a lot, hence the four stars. i opted for the light blue. the embroidery is a rich, vibrant blue and quite beautifully done. i am 5' 6" and 12other lbs. and the xs fits perfectly. it's intended to be a looser cut but it isn't at all frumpy and it hangs nicely. and it has pockets! all around a good summer staple.
3 I got this shirt in stores because it went on sale! i was excited to wear it, but it felt a little long on me. i decided that after a regular wash, it would help it. after washing, it shrunk way more than my other retailer clothes! now the arm straps feel really tight and the fabric lost its flowy-ness. it's a classic shirt, but it may not be worth the price for the quality of the fabric. be careful when washing.
other This skirt is a great staple. i somewhat agree with the first reviewer that it is a little big but not huge. i bought a m which is my regular size and i have to have it shorten the length, but that is typical for me since i am very short, but i liked the waist and didn't feel like it was too big and i have a very small waist. i don't like tight elastic at the waist and this sat very comfortably on me. nice heavy material for the winter.
3 If you can get over the fact that this skirt feels (and looks awfully similar to) the exact same fabric your drugstore halloween costumes had when you were a little kid... then, it's surprisingly fun to wear.
other Very pretty top! the fabric is super soft. i ended up sizing up from my regular xs to a s because the chest area was just a bit snug.
other I generally wear a 27. jeans fit perfectly. skinny, but not too skinny.
other I&#39;ve been eyeing this dress for weeks. finally i took the plunge and bought it! the velvet is gorgeous and the style is fun and playful. i know many of the reviewers said it was running large, but i had to order an xl because i nearly got stuck in the l (no stretch). im normally a size 16 and carry most of my weight in my stomach butt and hips. definitely more of a shift than a swing. however its still just lovely. looking forward to paring it with a kimono for a wedding tomorrow!
other This sweater is super cute and i so wish it worked for me. i am but i must like sweaters a little longer than everyone else because this just hit me at the wrong place. if you're still trying to work off that last little bit of your baby bump, even other years removed, this hits right there and emphasizes your waist, at least on me and i'm 5'5". it's so cute that i might have kept it to see if i could get it to work for me but it still has the ink tag on it so it has to be returned no matter what an
other Love this dress.  i like that it is somewhat form fitting but also has a nice swing to it.  green color is nice for summer.bought a similar maeve dress last year and it was all cotton like and soft, this one has a soft top but a different material on the bottom.  a little scratchy and crinkly.  wish the entire thing was as soft as the top
other Soft! sleeve is cuffed! different. called moonscape. cool vibe. tiny threads on front of moon.
3 I knew there was a problem when my dress arrived and the small fit perfectly when i was 9 months pregnant...i even bought a small even though i normally wear mediumi bought it for family pictures once my daughter was born but it made me look like i was still pregnant even though i had already lost all the baby weight in 3 weeks.it is a beautiful dress though and may try to get it altered to see if that works
other This is an adorable dress that just didn't work for me! so sad! i wanted to love it because the pattern is super cute. i gave it other stars because it is very pretty and i can see it working on others!
other I ordered my usual size small and it was very large on my 5'5", 112# frame.  my daughter loved it so she scored.  i ordered another one in xs, perfect though the sleeves run long! i have long arms.  can be dressy or casual.
3 I was very excited about this dress but when it came i saw it had too much going on. it either needs the ruffle taken away ( my first choice) or the halter part taken away. in the end i think it needs to go back.
other The material is very soft and the lace has a beautiful design. it looks very elegant and romantic. you will need a racer back bra to wear with it though, because of the design of the straps. it is very flowing and i think the cut is flattering. the material in the back is slightly transparent so you might want to wear a tank underneath. overall, very pretty and i would highly recommend. (i purchased the white and yellow version.)
other This cardigan is oh, so pretty! it does have a cropped length; it fall exactly at my waist.
other I don't normally write reviews, but i purchased this dress in white in 3 different sizes and each dress had the same flaw. the hems were very uneven on all three. this dress was poorly sewn. it's a shame because it looked awesome online. i was very disappointed!!!!!
other Since the reviews are quite polarized for this dress, i thought i'd throw in my $0.02...first, to clarify, there is indeed a zipper. it's well-hidden under the l arm (i didn't think there was one based on the reviews and got it on zipped fine; once it was on, i could feel the zipper [not uncomfortably, i just realized there was one]). dress does not have a lot of give, so i imagine that zipped, it would be difficult to get off. because no give, don't order down; that said, i found this dress to
other I love the navy blue color. they are a fun alternative to skinny jeans. the fit is great and they are super comfortable!
other This top is super cute and colorful. admittedly, i have not used it just as a pajama top because i think the world deserves to see this piece of art. super comfy and i recommend this for everyone in most shapes and sizes!
other I just received this coat and love it. the only downside is that online the color looks like a royal blue (which i wanted) but in truth the coat is a basic navy. this was not a deal breaker for me. i love the details. it is not lined as someone mentioned earlier but it's not meant to be a heavy winter coat. i can't wait to wear it with jeans, boots and a striped or plaid tunic.
other This top looks just as it does on the model and it fit just as they said it would. i needed a nice shirt to wear with jeans and camouflage my new-mommy tummy and this was perfect! it's really comfortable and fun, too!
other Purchased as a gift, but needed to return due to recipient weight challenged in past 6 months. heavier material of neutral tone ( with detailing of epaulets) pairs well with dresses, skirts, jeans, jeggings and whatever style of boots. veratile garment and will re-purchase for self in future.
other Beautiful sweater but the material is a bit thinner than i was expecting. but it hangs nicely and the sleeves are nice and long!
other This dress just feels and looks amazing. i love how it isn't too short like a lot of new styles. i think it will be wonderful with leggings or tights in the winter. i also love the plaid cuff detail. the only drawback is the buttons need to be reinforced. i got home and realized one button was missing. i went to the store to swap for a new one and when i went to cuff the arms, other buttons popped off!
other I got these in gray. like other reviewers mentioned, the waist is a little higher (not 70s though) but the jean had great control so it "holds" everything in instead of creating a muffin top which many shorter waisted jeans do. contours to the leg. love it!
other These are the best fitting jeans i've ever owned! no puckering near the crotch, and i don't need to have the waistband taken in. they probably run small.
other Great jeans!!! i'm over 60 & it's difficult finding jeans. these fit like a glove, with just enough stretch & the twisted hem adds a bit of unexpected style. i liked them so much, i ordered another pair!
other I love this shirt because it's casual yet fun! the first time i wore it i received several compliments because of the fun tassels.
other I love this vest and could not leave without it. the color and lining just make it perfect, so stylish and comfy! i'm always a 8/10 and a m in this was perfect. the color is so beautiful and its so easy to dress up and down. i am big on the bottom, the tie in the back adds a nice shape to your whole profile and makes it a less boxy vest! love love...
other I spotted this pj pants in the store, tried it on, and love it! the material is very soft and comfortable. the fabric is on the thin side, thus, one star off the quality. the pattern/color varies, the one i got has more pinkish flowers. i am 5'2", 120lbs, and size s fits nice. i could probably go down to a size xs, but i like my pj pants to fit a bit roomy, therefore size s fits better. the length is more like ankle length on me since i am petite. it is very cute on and perfect for a chill summe
3 I ordered this dress after seeing it styled with a beautiful cape.  when it arrived, it was incredibly soft and the color was a pretty, muted pink.  however, once i put it on, it clinged to all the wrong places.  having a larger chest made it show a lot of cleavage and if i can't wear a standard bra with it, it's too complicated.  in a regular tank dress, it would have been a yes. overall a great dress, but probably for another body type.
other I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable, the fabric contains acrylic and the knitted fairisle part started pilling within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes, it looks horrible, and the fleece part is looking a little grungy as well. so so disappointed. the top is intentionally oversized and comes down to my crotch, i could have easily sized down.
other I tried these on in the store and they are super cozy. at 5'1", they hit me just above the ankle in the regular length. i came to the website to get the petite length, hoping for a better fit in the rise as well as a slightly shorter leg length. these pants are comfortable without looking sloppy.
other I so wanted to keep this, but the xs was even too big. i usually take an xs/s petite and thought i could get away with the xs of this. it is just too big. so sad to be returning it, wish it came in an xxs or petite.
3 I ordered this dress when it was briefly on sale with an extra percent off. i was very excited to receive it in my usual size large, and wear with a jean jacket and cowboy boots. when i took it out of the package, i could tell it looked really small. i didn't even try it on. i had my daughter who wears a size small try it on, and she couldn't even get it over her hips. if you are tall and thin like the model, it will work for you. it is made of cupro, looks exactly like the photo, the color is g
3 I was really excited to get this top but unfortunately its going to have to go back. i am 5'6 120 and usually a s fits. however, this was really tight. also, the material is really really thin for the $90 price-tag. save yourself some money and avoid this one.
other I purchased the orange tiger print and absolutely love it! the colors and pattern are rich and vibrant and can easily be dressed up to be worn for work or a night out!
other Love this top. i'm athletic, it's a little tight around the arms. but it's a really nice looking blouse off and on!
other First, i must agree with the other reviewers who said that this jacket is short, because, well, it is. that being said, it is a perfect length for someone who is petite, like me. i am not a fan of lengthy tops or jackets, which tend to make my short body look like a blob. i love the length (or shortness) of this jacket! aside from that it fits true to size, is wonderfully warm and cozy, and makes me feel fabulous when i'm wearing it. it is my new favorite jacket!! :)
other I took everyone's advice and purchased a size small instead if medium.  i wish i had gotten my usual size as the neckline and bodice is very tight.  i'm top heavy with a wide rib cage and 36dd's.   other than that, the skirt of this mango hued beauty is large loose and flowing which i can see why people suggest sizing down.  i think my fit problem would be solved if petite was available.
other I found this dress on a pretty good sale. i'd never pay full price. that said, it's very stylish. it reminds me of marni, mui mui or prada. as other posters have mentioned, it does run tight across the bust
other This dress makes my heart skip a beat. it's beautiful, soft and colorful. it's a lovely midi length which can be tricky for 5'5" lil ole me but it's perfect. it has slits up the side for an easy breezy look. the fabric is so silky & pretty form fitting if you buy the right size. i'm a solid 4. have bought heaps of dresses from retailer and i can't stop, won't stop.
other This blouse is beautiful and i saw someone wearing it and she looked great. i went and bought this to wear for a holiday party and it is not for people with any sort of chest! it looked ridiculous on me as the pleats started right at the bra line and caused the blouse to tent out in both directions! however - looks super cute on those more on the flat-chested side!
other This top is a mix of materials - a silk and more of a t shirt material. i purchased for dressier wear but the material makes it more casual. i like the sale price so i'm keeping!  size down, runs a tad loose.
other This dress is lovely. i'm tempted to buy it in all of the patterns that i like, but i'm forcing myself to be economical. (i check regularly to see if it's on sale, however! then they're all mine!)this dress is soft, comfortable, classy, and has the unique feature of having a low-cut back. my only complaint is that the holes for the arms droop sometimes so reveal my bra. this could be from my shape, however, because i am rather busty. the dress runs true to size and is easy to clean. it's one o
other Bought this to wear to desert trip this weekend when we see the stones, dylan, mccartney, who, roger walters and neil young. think its the perfect outfit as it definitely has an 80's feel, now if only i had a pair of brown or teal boots, it would be perfect. i'll keep hunting~
other I like this sweater for its classic shape and grosgrain ribbon finish on the placket. it does have buttons all the way down and they are a little hard to open but the style is fun and fresh. it will dress up or down as shown with jeans and tee shirt. fit is like on the model for me in a large as i usually wear a 10-1other on top. the arms are quite long even for me at 5'9".
other For my 5'9", 36 c bust, hourglass frame, and 170 lbs, i got the medium and found it fit well. a bit snug but i didn't want to go to large and have it too loose at the top. my thoughts below:__________pros:- lots of stretch and comfortable due to being part modal.- the pleating on either side on the shoulders just drapes so lovely with the cowlneck. it just gives it an edgy look that i really like.- this "grey" has actually a minuscule houndstooth-like or checkboard-like appearance that's ha
other I love this sweater dress and get compliments every time i wear it.. i bought the navy in size xs. the pattern and colors are just fun and youthful, although you don't have to be young to look good in this dress. the dress is fitted, but the skirt flares, making it flattering if you have hips like me. the material is not too heavy so you can wear this 3 seasons fall, winter, spring. as other reviews have mentioned the dress is short. i am 5'9" so it does hit well above my knees. this isn't an is
3 Tried this on and loved it except for one thing -- the sleeves are split, so any movement reveals most of your arm, shoulders. which also makes it fairly impractical for winter/the office (yes, i could wear a sweater or blazer with it, but that defeats the purpose of having an all-purpose cute top.) why, retailer? this is a perfectly cute top and looks great with jeans etc., but the split sleeves make it a no-go.
other This dress is so unique, and is high quality. it came nicely packaged, and unfolded with no wrinkles. i bought it as a cool summer dress for events, and it fits the bill. i wore it once, and received many compliments. the only issue, is that you cannot take even medium size steps wearing this dress. a side slit would have solved the problem, but that would not have deterred me from buying it. the straps for the slip underneath are great, so that i could adjust it so my bra would not show.
other I tell everyone i know to try these jeans, that they are so worth the price tag. i've been an ag super fan for years, but i fell in love with paige the moment i tried these on. (i still love ag for their colored and patterned ankle denim and cords.) i have worn these over 50 times without ever having to wash them. (i never understood the idea that you're not supposed to wash denim, but now i realize that it's feasible.) they don't stretch out and still hug me like a second skin - without feeling
other Outstanding dress. looks like a class that i will wear for many events to come. i couldn't decide which color way i liked in this dress----the red/white or the green, so i purchased both. i can see myself wearing the red into early fall and the green is a very springtime/summer dress. yes, the cut runs small but i don't think it is as small as some of the other reviews. i typically wear i size 6, and this one the 8 fit perfectly, so maybe one size up.
other The fabric is a nice weight jersey. i prefer to wear the dress backwards as the back of the dress has a moderate v and the round neck (which is actually the front of the dress) makes for a very flattering back. the skirt part of the dress is full but the jersey fabric falls in such a way that does not cause the silhouette to look "hippy". this is not a dress that fits close to the body through the torso, so if you're looking for that you might consider going down a size.
other I normally wear a large or extra-large; the medium is still very billowy on me. this blouse is ethereal and lovely, though - pretty and funky at the same time. it's sheer but somehow not revealing. perfect for when you want to look composed and cool on the hottest day of the summer.
other I hesitated to purchase this dress because of the color but it is a beautiful deep pink that i think would work with all skin tones. i ordered a size down as recommended by other reviewers and the dress fits perfectly. the feel is amazing - incredibly comfortable and not too short when you lean over!
3 I'll start by saying that i loved this dress. i tried it on in the dressing room and knew i had to have it. the colors and design are beautiful and the fabric is soft. i did have to size up but it fit me perfectly once i did. i'm 5'1" 130 lbs 3other d size 6 fit great. the first time i pulled it out at home, i was gently pulling up the zipper and once it hits those ribbon areas on the side, the zipper seam split. i tried for a half hour to get it to realign. i finally decided to go exchange it for
other What originally attracted me to this top was the rich floral print with the stunning and vibrant colors. however, the colors in this blouse are more vintage autumn than actually pictured on this model. although, the colors are darker, you can still wear many things with this blouse. the top is floaty but doesn't look like a tent! i feel ultra feminine and comfortable in it. definitely a top that you need for that "something special" but it is not too dressy or not too casual...just perfect! don'
other The top red is more like orange. was disappointed and returned it
other This is a delightfully soft and fluffy sweater. i might have bought it if my store had the petite size. the white was pretty and a good weight (not too light or heavy) and comfortable. it would be fun to layer over various outfits. it did not seem to shed.
other I love, love, love this top! it is beautiful and very unique. the first day i wore it i got so many compliments! highly recommend!
other Remarkable dress, so much so that people stop me to remark about it!
other An retailer associate gave me this to try on since i love white clothing and lace. i tried on a large for my 5'9", 36c. hourglass frame and found it to be a tad large and probably could go down a size. my thoughts are...._______________pros:- breathable and comfortable fabric due to cotton/linen blend.- lace detailing at the top is lovely.- runs tts except i found the arms ran a tad small (and i have smaller circumference). but there's enough stretch._______________cons:- extremely sheer!
other I wear med or large in most items. the medium was huge. fit like a moo moo. size down by at least two.
other I thought this suit would be the perfect solution of stylish but forgiving of my new mom bod. this one didn't work for me. i ordered the medium. the top is very small--i would recommend only for b cup or smaller. the full coverage bottoms did nothing for my shape. it seemed to make me seem rounder and shorter. sending this one back! i did find success same size in a faux wrap style retailer suit.
other The material is cheap and looks torn. not as nice as the picture.
other Normally i would not have bought this color and print, it is just not a color that i usually wear. but after reading reviews i ordered it online. i love love this top. it looks good, is flattering, and is a very nice and different color. i wore it with berry leggings and love it. the top is very comfortable, can be worn with pants and leggings. the only issue i have is that since the jersey fabric is only at the back and not in the front, it pulls at the tummy section in the front and shows an o
3 The fit is really flattering and cute but the fabric and finishings seem really cheap. it's a printed plaid - not woven.
3 I ordered the geranium and teal. geranium is an awkward pink, but i loved the teal. beautiful color. ordered large, hoping for some length. they're very lightweight and almost too short. if you hold this up its just a big rectangle, but it flows nicely over the body and has the appearance of being longer on the sides. unfortunately you can see all of my bra and to my stomach when my arms are even slightly raised. i decided to return both.
other This is a fantastic skirt and very flattering. i plan to wear this with boots as shown on the model as well as sandals when it gets warmer. i would say that it does run true to size.
other I love this top. i got it on sale and am so glad that i did. it is a short too but still super flattering. it isn't too boxy on me.
other I love love love this print and had to have it when retailer had their 25% off sale. i think regular price is way too much for this dress as the dress isn't even silk or a better material. but once i got this i was so disappointed, i ordered my usual size and it was just a balloon/tent on me. i felt like i was wearing a maternity dress. plus the ruffle at the top which i thought was a sweet feature felt really awkward and like it was grazing my neck and chin in an annoying way. i don't even want t
other I love this skirt! so soft and comfortable, i wore it casual with black nike sneakers, a black loose turtleneck top and a moto leather jacket. i tried on the m and l and went with the m, so i would say it is true to size because that is what i usually wear. i'm 5'9', 14other lbs,nice thick fabric, but not heavy, good for cool weather.
other I'm being eyeballing this dress for quite a while, finally i decided to jump on it and i was so ansy to receive it in the mail, finally arrived and some how wasn't what i was expecting, the front part has other pieces of fabric attached to the sides of the dress that wrap around your waist making that effect you see on the model. to be honest i didn't like that at all, i think they ruined the dress with that, the dress is very comfortable feeling, the fabric is super soft i can imagine wearing this
other Perfect fit, nice detailing best feature is that they do not bag outafter wearing for a short time. good lines in back so they are moredressy than a regular legging.
other I saw this in the store and decided to try it on. it is so pretty. the fit is perfect. i didn't think that i would like it due to the sequins on the front. when i put it on, i didn't mind them at all. it really is a beautiful dress with beautiful colors. dry clean only is the only drawback to this one.
other I am so glad i waited for this to go on sale! this shirt is incredibly soft, with great detail on the fading. i ordered a medium (5'10", 160 lbs) and it fits perfectly.
3 Super soft, super cute but too short for a dress, too long and too overwhelming for a shirt, and didn't like the look with leggings at all so sadly i'm returning. love the colors, feel and style but no way will sizing up or down fit in a way that was functional...having said that..fits tts i guess.
other Love the perfectly placed ruching. the red lace over black and elegant. fits like a glove. gives me great curves
other So pretty & comfortable! love it!
other I was skeptical about buying a romper. i was also unsure what size would fit me (i'm 5'5" and 150 lbs.)  to my delight, the romper fit perfectly! it's a gorgeous and flattering fit.  i love the design and fabric!  it's stunning!
other There were no reviews, it's an "online exclusive" and thought it might look good with a nice skirt at an upcoming wedding. the spandex jersey back looks like sweat shirt material. on the white version of this, it is mismatched with an oatmeal color and white that just looks awful. as a busty 36d i was stunned to find myself swimming in a medium. it does not look like the photograph and the sleeve billow out. i feel like this had to have been clipped and tucked in for this photograph. i'm an anth
other I tried this dress at a store today and ended up ordering it online. i tried the red which is a beautiful, vibrant color. i wasn't sure how it looked on my skin tone though (pale like death), so i ordered the black. i do believe it runs small in the chest and shoulders. i am normally a size other in shirts, but the buttons were straining over my chest and my shoulders felt constricted. i tried the 6 and it was plenty roomy. for reference, i am a 32c with athletic shoulders. overall...pros:-an
other The shirt brings back the '60s look of appliquã©d patches on shirts. it is a quality piece with a bit of humor. the length is shorter than usual for chambray shirts but also very comfortable . it could be left open as a light jacket over tees and tanks. fabric feels good on skin.
other I got the green motif color which is really multi color: blue, orange, purple, yellow, green and brown. the fabric is gauzy and sheer, nice and breezy for summer. there is a subtle stitching detail at the shoulders. i ordered my usual size, medium, and it fits well in the shoulders and arm holes, but it is extremely billowy in the body. i had to take it in a couple inches on each side to make it a little less full. it's still has some swing, but not quite as much as before.
other This is a great sweater. it's lightweight and very comfortable. i bought a medium but really could use a small. medium still worked well though.
other I saw this dress in the catalog and on-line and it looked so lovely on the models. i took a chance and ordered it in my normal size small. when it arrived i was a little disappointed with the weight of the fabric, it was a bit light in my opinion. it did have an interesting texture, (suede like) so i could overlook the weight of the fabric if the dress fit well. unfortunately it did not, it rather just hung there and was not flattering on me. it looked wonderful on the model but i keep forgettin
other This dress is very versatile and i plan to use in all year round with some tights and boots in the fall/winter and strappy sandals in spring/summer. i originally purchased this dress in a m but had to size down for a more snug and flattering fit. the navy is much darker than the picture.
other These are super cute and i love the ties on the legs. fit is true to size. i bought them on sale and they had some black marks on the front when received. i called retailer and their great customer service guaranteed that i could return them if the black did not come out when washed. it did, so i'm stoked.
other I've purchased pilcro jeans in the past and they've held up great. unfortunately, the material used for this particular jean is a far, far cry from what it used to be. the thighs of these jeans start pilling (yes pilling!) after just a few wears. i've never had jeans do this -- whatever denim blend they are using is a complete disaster.don't buy these -- you will be very disappointed.
other I've been looking for an off the should sweater like this for over a year! looks great on and doesn't itch! can't wait for fall so i can wear it!
3 I have been searching high and low for some good quality jeans. sadly i don't think these are it. i love the design and style of these jeans. great length, great cut, great color unfortunately in the 3 weeks that i have had them they are balling and looking like i've had them for 3 years. i'm so disappointed. and will have to continue on my search. apparently they don't make jeans like they used too?
3 Beautiful sweater coat! love that is easy to pop on & head out. i did have to go to a seamstress and have the button moved as it was to large and boxy around my waist area.
other I think this shirt would be really cute on the right body type, just not mine. i'm 5'5, 12other and a 34ddd a couple weeks post partum. thought this could be a good shirt while i'm nursing bc it's flowy but stylish. unfortunately it did nothing for me when i put it on. the cut drew all attention to my big chest---not in a good way--and distracted from my smaller lower half. made me look much bigger and heavier than i actually am. probably good for small chested girls, very tall girls or curvy on the
other Material is heavy enough to provide warmth on a crisp day or evening.  add poncho or large warm scarf to keep colder temps @ bay. sure wish this came in blk. i bought mauve & just love it!
other Very pretty top, comfortable and soft but looks nice enough for work!
other Very cute skort that fits tts. great length for us middle aged women as well! love the hidden front pockets and the modern color block design. my only issue is the side zipper gets stuck right where the waistband starts. i'm assuming this is because of the thicker fabric around the waistband. i usually try to wait for the sale prices, but i think this skort will sell out well before then.
other This was a really nice, soft lightweight sweater, perfect for transitioning into fall. i found it to be a tad boxy and while i love a high/lo hem, it was a little short in the front for my liking. i'm still debating if i'm keeping it since i bought it full price, but the color was really pretty and on sale, i would def. go for it. for reference, i got a large since i normally like my clothes more loose.
other Although $$$$$ i want to support usa products and am so glad retailer continues to add these options .i also decided to splurge with family coming home for the holidays, a way to stay in pajamas but still look dressed. i am only 5'2" and these were just longer than capri length, more like the close-up view online. to get them ankle length you would have to push them way down on your hips, not sure how the tall model did that! i am 106 lbs and considered exchanging the xs for an s, these run
other Really like the style/aesthetics of the top. it is very unique, and works with a variety of pants. the only downsides are that it flares out a bit more than it appears on the model, and it arrived somewhat wrinkled. i am 5' 6" 12other pounds and i got a size 4. looking forward to wearing this a lot in the fall.
other Very comfy and easily could dress down or up!
3 This sweater has a fun big bold flower and a nice blue color and is quite roomy. the fit is larger around the arms and chest, which might work well for people who are very curvy on top. it seems to taper a bit to the waist. the roomy fit to the arms gives it almost a bat wing shape. it was too overwhelming on my petite frame, what with the bold flower and the fit, so i passed. but if you like the big flower and color and want a roomy sweater, this could work well for you.
other Tried this romper on in store and wanted to love it but it just didn't fit me right. it'a great romper, cute design, super soft-light fabric and overall a great feel but it doesn't work to well for short girls with any types of hips. i have a very small waist and larger bottom and this romper just was very unflattering. i couldn't get the tie waist to sit anywhere that felt like my natural waist, instead it kept giving me a kangaroo pouch and hung on my upper thighs. sizing up didn't help becaus
other I am in love with this top. i was a little nervous because i'm on the bustier side (34d/dd) but it works for me so i say give it a shot--you never know. i'm hoping for more tops like this in the fall line.
other I'm a big fan of level 99 jeans and linen pants. these are great-- good quality, flattering fit, lovely color. i got the coral in size 26/petite, and that works for me. they do start out just a bit snug in the seat when i first put them on, but they'll pretty quickly stretch out just enough to maintain shape without becoming baggy, like my other level 99 linens-- something to keep in mind when trying to find your right fit. i was a little worried that the drawstring meant there wouldn't be much
other It does snag easily which stinks because it's darling and i love it to pieces.... i just hope it doesn't end up in pieces!
other Love the knit. contrast stitches add interest. quality is great and it is true to size. very happy i made this purchase, especially because i caught it on sale after eyeing it for months. great with denim or a black dress.
other I liked this bc it is long, ivory and thin. i think it will be a versatile piece to wear with tees & casual dresses. it has a little hook & button closure up on one shoulder if you wish to wear it more as a wrap. looks cute that way too.
other I have broader shoulders and thick arms, this dress does an amazing job slimming my arms and not making me appear top heavy!i'm 5'other 12other lbs, the xs fit perfectly
other I stalked this sold out product for weeks hoping my size would become available. when it did, i was very excited, in fact i ordered both a s and xs to be sure one sweater would fit me! unfortunately, neither did and i felt the actual sweater was not as pictured. the sweater has an overall baggy fit and the cutouts don't fall as neatly and as evenly on both shoulders as the picture shows, making the look a bit sloppy in my opinion. it is such a shame as this look is very of the moment and the mod
other I just received my back-ordered wildberry top in blue. it's not blue but instead a dull, mottled purplish hue. it looks like a well-worn, stretched out tee shirt with a tired ruffle along the bottom. so disappointing. it's going back for sure.
other This is a great sweater. i gave it four instead of five stars because it runs unusually wide and is a bit boxy. if you like your clothes a little big, this is the sweater for you!
other I bought this online in the grey and blue and had high hopes. it runs big so size down at least 1-other sizes. i didn't realize that the sweater looking part on the forearms was part of the coat. that part of the coat is really nice and comfy. unfortunately, the rest of the coat (the wool part) is very itchy. it would've been awesome if it was lined on the inside, but it's not...so i'm taking them back.
other Beautiful spring dress. perfect for luncheons or any occasion. so very pretty, lovely fabric and good fit. you will definitely feel pretty in this dress. y daughter is 5'3" and the length was perfect.
other I usually wear a 6 for skirts and dresses, but when i got this in the mail, it ended up fitting a bit snug on my hips. other than that its super cute and has a great liner underneath!
other Love the design and print. absolutely beautiful bathing suit. would size up on the bottoms. top is true to size.
other Ordered these in a size 3other and they fit perfectly!
other I bought this in both the navy (a more saturated blue in person - gorgeous!) and green, but both are going back. it fit everywhere but in the upper arms, even across my chest, and i usually encounter the opposite. i think it might just be the way it's cut across the shoulders that don't allow for much movement. so, while beautiful and so incredibly soft, it has to go back. (if you have slender arms, i think it would be a great fit.)
other I love this dress because it is amazingly feminine and easy to wear. i put this dress on and immediately felt elegant, sophisticated, and flirty all at the same time. a few tailoring uniquenesses i want to mention; stretchy, form fitting, sexy sheer upper and front back panel, you can wear a bra and not see it thru the sheer front and back portions of the dress, the waist is exactly tailored to show off back side. it is true to size.
3 I tried this sweater on in the store. i love the design and was hoping it would look as good on me as it does on the model. first off i should point out that the navy color in the featured photo looks much lighter than the sweater does in person. some of the photos accurately represent how dark the blue is (it almost looks black) but the featured photo shows it more like a medium navy. secondly, anyone looking to purchase should know it is very warm. if you are buying to wear mostly indoors you
other Love this top. purchased in a size medium, my typical retailer size and is very comfortable and lovely. wearing it under the pink peplum cardigan it was shown together with as well as wear it with jeans and other pants. i wish it came in different colors and other images as this a very well made top. purchased during the after christmas tag sale and love it even more. will be great in spring and summer, cooler days in summer.
other This dress is sweatshirt material and a lovely soft grey aqua color. i purchased a medium and it is an inch above my knee...ii am so tired of seeing woman my age and much younger in jeans...i am wearing this to a cooking class and it is perfect because it is so comfortable.....it is a great replacement for jeans!!!!!!!
other #childsize. not sure where this went wrong but it's going back immediately. always wear a 0-other in retailerpologist skirts, this size 0 runs at least two sizes too small. the material is beautiful, but if i got the size i needed i would be entirely swallowed by fabric. so disappointing.
other I love the print and design, the photo does not do it justice. i fell in love with it in the store but could not find my size. i ordered my size online but it was still small and short. it came up to my waist, and was tight in the shoulders and waist. i really wish it wasn't so small. i love love this top, the colors are vibrant and shiny, totally my style. i highly recommend it if it fits.
other Color (orange/red) and fabric nice and good qualityi ordered this since i live in astoria but am glad i did.
other Just received these and they fit perfectly, but the panels are different shades of gray. the color is not consistent and it make them look bad. they are perfect otherwise, but sadly they are not wearable. i will be returning
other Love this vest. it is super soft and cozy yet fits and lays well. not bulky, so it's a great piece to layer over flannels. it has a bit of stretch.
other Beautiful color and  soft material but runs a little big so size down. i loved that it was complementing to my figure without making me look larger
other True to size i found. got the medium and had a bit of room to spare. usually i'm a 6 on the lower half, (34-28-36).the upper portion is a very very light heathered grey, almost cream and yes, i found it to be see through.comfortable but either for lounging round the house only or wear a tunic to cya!
other I ordered this blouse after it went on sale - i'm not typically the blouse-y type, but i thought i'd try it. for me, and i'm a pretty consistent small across brands, it was quite flowing and a little long, but that may be what someone wants. it was a little light in color to look good on me, but i think this would be really cute with dark skinny jeans - easy to dress up or down :)
other Great layering top. so comfy, feels soft as my pjs. bought it in 3 colors.
other I love this skirt so much. it's so comfortable and flattering. the button design along the sides is adorable. it's got a liner inside the skirt that ensures that it's not see-through in anyway. it's a great buy.
3 This very lightweight cardigan looked like an eggplant color online. it's brown with a hint of burgandy. not bad, but unexpected. i am very short -waisted, and this lies very high on my torso. the seams are unfinished, and it looks cheaply made. glad i got this on sale.
other These jeans were so cute on- wore them a handful of times and they'd been washed twice. put them on and - rip! ripped right at the crotch in the front so not fixable- and on vacation no less when i had to scramble to find something else to wear. poor quality - disappointing and not what i expected from retailer. :-( they also run large even for a more relaxed fit- sized down for a good fit.
3 I found these to fit odd. i am also use to wearing the skinny jeans so trying a wide leg was a bit weird anyway. the placement of the pockets and the way it hit my waist was awkward and not flattering. i am usually a 8/10 and the 8 fit but just did not look good.
other I love the design of this top.  the pattern is beautiful and the back unique.   i am a mom of two so i really appreciate the extra front coverage.  i can run around at the beach with my kids and not be worried about overexposure.  i am a 34d on top and purchased the large and it fits well.
other This skirt caught my eye immediately. i love the beautiful patterns and colors. i'm currently pairing it with a charcoal grey top, which works well. the only slight concern is the material is a little poofy. i still love it, and definitely recommend this standout piece.
other These shorts were exactly as expected. they are nice thin shorts perfect for a hot summer in texas. i have just worn a few times out running errands in high 90 degree weather and they were perfect. i bought the grey and they are a nice change from jean shorts, but still match just about any top. i typically wear a size 0, but after reading the reviews purchased a size 2, so i would say they run a little small. they are slightly snug in the waist, but i ordered online and liked them enough to kee
other I saw this tee and was unsure about the print, but decided to give it a try. i'm glad i did, as it has become a weekend staple.
other This is a stylish blouse with classic features as well as quirky features such as pleats and gathers. very flattering fit!
other It just didn't work for me. i don't know if it is my fair complexion and untanned legs, but this dress was a strike out. the orange floral design and beading is beautiful and the fitting i would say is pretty tts. for reference, i am 5'7" and 145lbs with 36" 30" 40" measurements and i purchased a medium. the chest and arms were not too tight like other reviews stated. the length is about the length in the picture and a lot of fabric to make it very flowy. overall, very good quality and beautiful
other Beautiful suit. i had been eyeing this one for weeks and finally decided to just buy the darn thing. it is tiny, just beware. as in it doesn't cover much, especially on the booty. not a bad thing, but buyer beware :) if you are looking for more coverage, size up. i wear a 32d and ordered a medium top. good thing i didn't get a small. i have to get the band taken in a bit, but i need the coverage in the cup. for the bottoms i also got a medium and usually wear a small or medium in swimwear bo
other This great casual jacket has a confusing fit but if you know what you want and understand the style, you can be surely happy with this plush & smooth stadium coat. first, the neutral/beige fits a little easier but it is definitely larger in the body compared to the navy. for both colors the shoulders and sleeves are fitted (perhaps a little tight) while the body has an a-line flare and subtle hi-lo hem. the neutral really flares out a lot while the blue is a gentle flare. if you have narrow shou
other I love this suit! the fit is incredible. i'm unsure that the fabric will stand the test of time, but i got it on sale, and i don't know about you ladies but ill do anything for a great suit!
other Super cute in raspberry and very flattering! i paired it with the reversible tank in dark gray, skinny jeans and fringe boots.
other Love this top! however, i'm biased bc i love hd, such originality in their clothing, even in something as simple as a black tank top. also comes with the bra strap snaps, but i find my straps still show in the back, need to wear a strapless or criss cross. please note that the sides sort of rise up to meet the laces. so the more you tighten the laces, the more it comes up (hard to explain!). if you are at all even a little sensitive about a muffin top, again with low rise, it would show! still l
other I ordered this top in the pink in a medium (i usually wear a small or medium in retailer shirts). it fit tts with not being too short. the embrodiery is very pretty, better in person than online. my only complaint is it's a bit blousey, so you would need to either tuck it in or wear with skinny jeans/shorts. for reference, i am 5" 4.5"' 13other lbs and a 32c.
other I ordered this beautiful sweater skirt in petite because i'm too short (5'3") for the asymmetrical hemline. i love the geometric pattern on this skirt and the gold flecked waistband. and the light sweater material make this a perfect skirt for my california fall/winter.
other Very cute dress, but fabric is very flimsy and seams were very puckered which couldn't be pressed out.
other Gorgeous baby blue lace is a must see. i received many compliments. my only gripe is that i don't love when shirts have those connecting camisoles (which make it harder to put on) as i would much rather just have a sewn in lining, but it didn't deter me. i am 5'5", 135lbs, 34c, muscular/curvy frame and a size other fit perfectly.
other I ordered my usual size 6 in tops at retailer in both the orange/blue print & the pink color. fit is tts & looks pretty much on me as in the pic. lightweight & cool for these hot days. the 'pink' really is not pink - it's a true orange so i returned this one. i didn't really need an orange top. if it had been as in the pic which is a pink/coral-like color i wld have kept it. the orange/blue print is really appealing so that is a keeper. this top is a little flowy but not tent-like which is perfect
other While it hasn't been cold enough to wear this out, i really like this sweater. i love the pattern with the uneven hem and stripes or bands. it's also super soft and cozy feeling. it does run a little big, and while that is part of the aesthetic, i do wish it was a drop smaller. i ordered my normal top size, medium, and it's a little big/looser, which i don't mind except for the long sleeves. if you like things with a tighter fit i might order a size down.though it's cashmere, it still seems
other I saw the cream color in size regular small in the "only one left" section at my local store. i had my heart set on this dress all summer but it was sold out, so i was super excited to see it. the color is true cream, like linen color. i was surprised that the dress is very heavy, as heavy as a medium sized coat. i can't understand why it's so heavy because the top is sleeveless and the dress part is pretty sheer. the dress is about 2" pass my feet which i wouldn't mind having it hemmed, but the
other Beautiful skirt, love the colors. so glad i bought this. runs a little big
3 I really loved the color and fabric of this sweater. i liked everything about it except how wide it was at the bottom. i returned it for this reason.
3 I was really hoping that this dress would fit perfectly because it looks beautiful on the model! however, when i put the dress on, there is a seam where the top portion meets the bottom portion and it made the skirt stick out a ton. i ordered the 0p and i am 5'4" 110lbs. maybe ordering this dress in a larger size would prevent the skirt from looking so full at the top.
3 Received this and love the style, but it falls just a little below my waist and i like my tops to be longer.  it'll definitely fit a shorter torso.
other So sure from the online shop & images that i ordered two pairs. the package arrived in less than other days and immediately i could see how the cords were everything i expected them to be. so incredibly soft and body forming and has a classic cord texture only softer. i love them ! this look works both daytime as well as evening - it's geared to work with any casual to couture look. my 2other year old niece wanted to buy the second pair (sz 28) from me so i gave them to her. she's a nice niece : )
other I love this dress. the colors are eye catching. if flows nicely.
other Good quality and design. perfect for casual office. definitely recommend. i don't know why it's called a cardigan because it's more like a casual blazer. note there is no button- just the tie to close. runs big. i'm 5'8'' 130# ordered the xs and it's roomy.
other I love this dress it is a little sheer so nothing that spanx won't cover. i have worn it a couple of times and have gotten many compliments.
other I read the earlier reviews on this, and though i agree that the photo here does not show how wide and swingy the top is, i love it! it is so adorable and comfortable. i bought the petite s, and i am 5'2", 118 lbs. it fit true to size in the shoulders. the petite hits just a few inches below my waist, so you might want to keep that in mind if you do not want it to be this short. the sweater part is soft, not itchy, and the poplin sleeves and ruffle are crisp but soft as well. because this is very
other This dress intrigued me a bit online, but not enough to order it to try it. even on the rack, i wasn't so sure about it, but decided to try it this afternoon. i couldn't have been more pleased. it is fresh, flattering, flowy, light and beautiful. even though there is quite a bit of fabric, the vertical stripes and nipped in waist make it extremely flattering. i didn't realize this came in blue as well. i may add that one to my wishlist, but the red one is a definite winner. it will make a great
other I'm in love with this print! the fabric feels wonderful- this is such a perfect transition dress! the adjustable waist tie makes the dress fit great!
other Very soft for vegan leather. very stylish. i thought it ran slightly small for size indicated on jacket. daughter is 8-10 but medium was tight.
other I love the design and color of this jacket. when i saw it pictured, i thought it was a vest. the sleeves and collar are made of a contrasting type of fabric; the sleeves are a knit but fit in very well with the design of the jacket.i ordered a small because i had ordered a small in a vest made by the same manufacturer. this jacket runs smaller, the sleeves were very tight , and overall it was just too small. had to return it.
other This is a beautiful and fashionable blouse. it feels good on as it is made of viscose, it is pretty and feminine. color is great, of course it needs to be your color. i love it and recommend it!!
other I grabbed this during a 20% off sale so i will state first that i don't think this top is worth full price, and even at 20% off i wasn't wowed enough to pay that much for it. the colors are more saturated in person and very pretty. however, the cut- both the length and the width- just made it too overwhelming on my size 14/16 frame. i ordered the xl and it was wayyyy too big through the chest but sizing down to a large meant that it didn't flow over my hips as well because it's so long. i think
3 While i love the design, this sweater even in the small is too over-sized for me and was unflattering. it was returned.
other I am amazed this is still on sale. it's so comfortable and fabulous!!
other Very cute top. i ordered the white & it is thin so you might want to wear a cami with it. will look very cute with jeans, shorts or skirts. love the back! wish it came in more colors - would definitely order it in black.
other Very pretty blouse. it does run quite large, i am usually an xs-s or 0-other and purchased the 0. i could probably have gone to a 00. for reference i am 5'4" 118 lbs 34b/c. it says that it is dry clean only, however i washed in in delicate cycle with cold water and threw in the dryer for a little bit. it came out perfect! i was hoping to shrink it and it only shrunk a tiny bit. i was hoping for it to shrink more but it is fine. no need to even iron it! i was lucky enough to get it on sale, i don't t
other Love this top! i get compliments on it every time i put it on! it dresses up a pair of jeans perfectly!
other First off, i adore this jumpsuit.  i love the mixed stripes and i love that the fabric is structured, textured and substantial.  and for me, the xs fits perfectly, however the sizing is way off from standard sizing. i'm 5'2", 110, 24.other waist, 32.other hips, and usually 00p-0p, and this is fitted on me.  the wide legs aren't too wide like most wide legs (which wear me instead of vice versa) and the structure of the fabric make this piece so flattering for petite ladies.  if you are petite, this jumps
other Just got this shirt in the mail and i am absolutely in love! i paired it with jeans and brown boots and got so many compliments. the shirt is light and flowy. it very flattering for any body shape.
other Unfortunately this top is shirt-length, and i'm only 5'4". needs to be about 6" longer. made of sweatshirt material, which i wouldn't mind if it were longer. also runs very wide- ordered an xs and could have gone smaller.
other Love this top! i typically wear a 4-6 and went with the 6 on this one. the length was better and the the buttons were perfectly closed. i am a 34d. this top looks great with everything.
other I have this in darker blue and it is my favorite dress of the season. i didn't realize that there was one in turquoise until it was already sold out. please bring back or be so kind to contact me if an xs comes in as a return, etc. i love this so much!
other I tried this one on in the store and my typical xs fit perfect. it's not too boxy in the waist like every other sweater this season. also the mock neck is not to wide and is flattering. it sheds which i do not like but not as bad as some. the material is thin but warm i would layer it.
other Perfect length and colors. i get asked where i got it on the reg, every time i wear it. mostly a casual vibe with flat sandals...
3 The fabric is beautiful, even the lining is lovely. i ordered the green color in a large, as i'm curvy and have long arms. but it just doesn't lay correctly at all - the collar has no structure, even though it's a lapel, and the side vents just pop out - the jacket added about 10lbs, and just looked frumpy. it looks much more tailored on the model. too bad, as i have been looking for a velvet blazer in the color for a long time.
other This top can be dressed up or down, very good quality fabric and colors shown as the photo (blue). i usually wear petite sizes but chose the regular version because i wanted to be able to tuck it in. i think it might be too short otherwise.
other I stared at this dress for a long time online and finally went into the store and tried it on. it is a beautiful quality and material. note that it is ivory, not pure white, which is exactly what i was looking for. the fit is more of an a-line and it is slightly long which is part of the style of the dress. i am taking it with me to a beach vacation in mexico but i plan to wear to many more occasions because this could easily be dressed up or down. just don't wear it to a wedding since it is a w
other Love this dress. very comfortable and stylish. wanted my size. but they only had a size larger available. still bought it, but feel good in it. glad i purchased it.
other I ordered this because the reviews were outstanding. i am returning it. although the embroidery looks fine on screen, in person it looks cheap and tacky. moreover, the high ruffled neck goes a step too far -- into over-the-top victorian cutesy.overpriced, to boot.obviously, mine is a minority opinion.
other This dress is very well-made, fully-lined, and overall quite beautiful. however, i will have to agree with the other reviewers who say that it runs small. i am typically a solid medium in retailer clothes (5'9", 36b, 15other lbs., apple shaped, long torso), but the medium in this is skin. tight. not a good look. the large fit much better and i did not find the skirt to be like a pencil (the fit is like the picture) and the length is at the knee. anyway, interesting that there is a such a huge differen
other I love this coat. i would definitely recommend it. i normally wear a size 6 or a medium. i bought my normal size and had to return it for a small. customer service was great and made for an easy online exchange.
other I wanted to love this blouse so much. but try as i might, it just fit so oddly on me. i'm usually a petite s so i purchased the xs in brown. first. the color was more gray-brown but it was still ok. but second, the fit was off. maybe i just got a bad one, but the center of the blouse was so offset, that the slit in the front laid so far to the left and the v-neck was so low that you could see my bra - there was no adjusting i could do to fix it. the material has a lovely soft silky feel to it an
other I really wanted to love this top, but there is way too much fabric. it looks nothing like the pictures. it was more like a maternity top vs. a swingy top. i'll be returning this one.
other Tried both colors....gorgeous, but kept the white as it offers more versatility in my wardrobe. happened to have an retailer cami that follows the lines of this top exactly to help conceal how transparent it is. [the black color will also need a cami -- strong sunlight or a camera flash will be revealing.] a lovely layering piece under sweaters, vests, jackets. so pleased!
other Purchased today at the 30% off summer tag sale. 5'7 and bought the size 6 - fits perfectly. a lovely combination of feminine and boho. will wear with dark jeans a a white tank. fabulous light, pretty summer topper...
other I ordered an xxs and it fit perfectly. i love the simple, yet girly look of this top. the bottom material is delicate and adds a feminine touch. it looks even better in person than in the pictures. the material is very soft and comfortable. looks great with jeans and flats or boots!
other The moss color intrigued me so i ordered a medium instead of large because it looked oversized. i generally wear a large. medium is a good fit. probably could have ordered the small, but wanted to preserve the draping on the side. this top is very wide but it looks great on. so do size down. love the color variations. it's true to the pics and is a nice addition to my casual lifestyle.
other This dress is perfect for weekend errands or i could see dressing it up as well. the material is a heavier weight, will not wrinkle and the pockets are an added bonus. i purchased the small in this dress and it is perfect. for reference: 32d, 27, 35
other Love this top! tried on a small in the store as it was the only size the had. the sales person ordered me a medium on line. i am wearing it tomorrow for my birthday! the stretch fabric is very flattering.
other The pants are everything i expected and much more! the material is a delicious and light weight. the colors are beautiful-white base with jade green and black design. there is a very comfortable elastic band waist with tie. i am 5'9" and ordered the longer length and they are just to the ground. i weigh 140 and have a slim figure and the medium is a very comfortable fit. i would highly recommend these if you like looks that are up to date and comfy-these are a win-win!
other I got this vest for my birthday and it is my favorite. it has a very clean design, well structured and you can really tell the product is high quality from the look and touch. i would expect this to stay in my closet for years to come.
other I ordered my usual size small in this top (34c) and it just fits across the chest. very cute top.
other I ordered this in an xs and it fits well. however, if you have a bigger bust this top may be a problem. i wear a b cup and it fits me well.
other This jacket is so great! i've gone through a few seasons now trying to find that one perfect little olive green jacket. this one wins! the color is nice and saturated. the fabric is soft and drapey so it's still flattering to my shape. it's slightly relaxed and i think it creates an "easy" look. i've already worn this with a dress, and it will finish off many other looks in my closet! yea! i'm 5'6", 138 lbs and took a medium.
other This is the perfect fall/winter sweater. i bought it in red and i would get another one in the green color if it weren't sold out in my size. love it!
other I ordered two colors and was happy with them both.  i wear tanks under many tops in the warm weather as so many are sheer.  i like a layered look, and having layers to peel as needed.  these tops are great on their own as well!  i recommend them to anyone wanting swing and extra length.  really love the fabric too!
other Love this shirt. it's easy to throw on and makes a cute outfit with about any kind of bottoms. i've wore it with leggings and jeans.
other I bought both colors thinking i might like one since i wasn't totally sold on colors looking online. well the cut is sooo flattering that i was sold and had to keep both. this shirts are great.
3 This dress felt small in torso and waist and suffocating in sleeves ( i do have average athletic arms). but the shoulders were cut so wide that one side was falling off, as i fix, one shoulder, another will slide down.the material is nice but since it is not lined, it feels inexpensive, disposable.
other This vest is very warm and soft. it is actually a fleece that almost appears as wool. the plaid is beautiful-a pretty soft pink with the black and charcoal colors. i ordered a size large and the fit is okay. an xl would have been too big under the arms and in the bust area however, i would have liked it a little looser in the bottom half. i kept the large as there is no closure to the vest. it just hangs open.
other I loved this dress when i saw it online, perfect for a summer wedding, but when i tried it on i was very disappointed. the fabric and styling are gorgeous and very high quality but the sheer amount of fabric on this dress is just not as pictured. there is layer after layer of silk and ruffle and while lovely, it made me look very large. i tried tying the belt many ways to no avail. sadly, it will have to go back. it may look good on a very thin frame but didn't complement my average one.
other This shirt is so great! i fell in love with it once i saw the back. if you're looking for a classic looking shirt with a little pizzazz, this is it. i have wide hips, and this tank if great because it's a little boxy without making me look huge. it's excellent quality, and i look forward to wearing this tank all spring and summer!
other I bought this in the green plaid for travel since i don't wear long pants of this fabric weight here in honolulu. it is styled so that you can roll the bottoms up for a more casual look, showing some ankle and wearing dress flats . would be a perfect casual work look with a navy tee. since i'm only 5'3" and this is travel-wear, i got it in a regular rather than petite because i wanted to keep the cuffed-look but cover my ankles. i tend toward adventure travel and these held up well on a recent t
other This dress is more adorable on then sitting on the hanger. the material clings to all the right places and feels really good. i must say this is one of the most comfortable dresses i have ever put on. would never tell from the photo that this dress is so adorable. if you like a fitted dress in the waist and bust that subtly accentuates your curves - try it. adorable!
other I am obsessed with the off the shoulder trend this season. i were mind on the shoulders so its work appropriate, and you can still tuck it in. the length is perfect. the colors are awesome. t paired it with a pair of pilco cords. it easily work with a skirt or dress pants.i would highly recommend!!!
3 This dress is such a beautiful color and the fabric is super soft and lovely. it would be stunning on someone with a slim figure, but since i've got curves/an athletic build, it simply did not work. too bad, because it is such a pretty dress!
other I love this shirt! it is so feminine and comfortable! will be on repeat!
other I loved this dress on the hanger and loved it more when i tried it on. i am usually an 8, but purchased the 6 in this dress. i preferred the empire waist to be more fitted which the 6 provided. you can decide which look you prefer. both looked good. i just wanted a less baggy look. as one reviewer mentioned, the print is cut different on all of the dresses. i think the colors pictured online are accurate. regarding the snake on the fabric, i have several snakes on my dress, but not on the back a
other Love this top, the lace detailing on it is gorgeous and fits tts. however, the length does run a bit short, not crop top short, but it is shorter than i expected, and i'm s short person.the color is listed as white and as pictured, it also looks white, but it's not. it's definitely an ivory color. i bought a white camisole to wear under it and when the top arrived, the tank didn't match the top.
other I recommend this dress for women wth a small bust. this is an absolutely gorgeous dress, but it runs very small through the bodice and is almost empire waisted. if you remember the coral dress from spring by the same designer, it fits the same but this one has a tiered skirt. so sad- i love this dress-the colors and design are beautiful.
3 This top is much stiffer, more baby-doll and boxier than pictured. lining is stiff too, and colors more muddy than shown. i wear boho tops all the time and this looked terrible on me (i have broad-ish shoulders and a chest). i thought it would be a fun, drapey top for transition to fall but unfortunately it's going back.
other Most often complimented item of this spring's wardrobe
other This suit did nothing for me. the top has zero support. this would work for a younger woman who does not require any support and is smaller chested. also, the top gapped in the center. it just did not fit right. the top is very thin showing everything. a light padding would make a big difference in this suit. also i could not get a good fit. as i tightened the top, the back would ride up. the bottoms are ok. not renatkable
other I just got this dress in the beige color and i absolutely love it. the fit is perfect and i feel that it is just the right length. i got a small and i am 5'9''. the pockets are a great touch and really are the key for tunic style dresses for me. i love the soft material and could live in this dress. such a great staple for my closet!
other Too much fabric, not a flattering top. for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40.
other This skirt looks/lays exactly like the photo. i bought a size small and i usually wear a size 4. it was maybe a smidge big, but nothing that affected the look of the skirt. the material reminded me of felt/wool mixed together, almost like sunday school felt cut outs (but stiffer) (not a fan).. i was underwhelmed - it looked plain and simple, and the color washed me out. definitely not worth the price (for me anyways). good luck!
other I purchased this jacket and the levis sherpa denim jacket for comparison. i chose this one over the levi's jacket as this one had more shape/curve to the bodice, which i wanted. i am usually a small but needed a medium in this jacket-- i have wider shoulders, 34c chest, 28" waist, 38" hip, 5' 4" 120lbs.
other This dress is really good quality and the beading is adorable. but, the sleeves combined with the maxi skirt made me look like i was a sister wife and not in a $250 dress. i still gave it four stars though, because i am having it hemmed to above the knee because i like the top part so much. i ordered the 00p, am 5'other 110 lbs and the waist fit perfect, the skirt was about three inches above my ankles. perhaps someone with a more boho style might find the length of the skirt cute but i just found i
other I bought this dress online to wear to work and i did not expect anything too impressive based on the picture of the model. i am really surprised at how beautiful, well-fitting, and soft this dress is. i am in love. it fits snugly, but the fabric is so thick that it is still very office appropriate (i work at a law firm). i ordered the small petite and it comes to the top of my knees.
other I've always loved the idea of jumpsuits, but could never find one that worked -- either the print was too crazy, or the length was too long, or the waist line looked funky on me. this one worked perfectly. i'm 5'4" and the regular xs fit nicely. can't wait to wear this, especially in the spring/summer.
other The fit on these pants is just right for me. i have curvy hips and a slender waste and legs. these pants don't gap in the back, as fitted pants often can. easy to dress up or down. the color hasn't held up as well as i hoped, so take care when laundering.
other I bought this coat shortly after christmas and am in love. it is meant to fit oversize but runs true to your natural sizing. i am a m/l in most retailer clothing and that is what i bought. it is great for layering for a dressed up look with a skirt or dress for work and also dressed down with jeans a t-shirt. and, although the arms are 3/other length it is super warm! so happy i purchased!
other Like the previous review said, i was excited to receive this top. i had grand visions of all the ways i could wear it! to my chagrin, when i put it on, it just fell right down and pooled around my waist. i wish there were smaller sizes to order. sadly, this is going back.
other This is a lovely, romantic skirt that hangs nicely. it is lined except for the ruffle on the bottom. as others have said, the waistband is stretchy and molds to your shape. it is high waisted. i called the store to hold a size other and 6 for me to try. when i got there, i finally settled on a size 2, so it runs a bit large. i have a 2other inch waist and 36 inch hips. if this fits your style, give it a try, you won't be disappointed.
other This jumpsuit is great. i recently had a baby and am still trying to get the last 10 lbs of baby weight off and this jumpsuit is very forgiving and super comfortable. i'm usually a medium & i wasn't sure if i should size up. i ordered the medium and it was the right choice. great light material for summer and nice neckline.
other I bought a petite medium and the length was right, but it fit like a potato sack. it was quite comfortable, and didn't look completely terrible from the front, but from the side, it was terribly unflattering. when i tried it on my boyfriend saw it and said it looked like i was wearing a nightie. i don't do form-fitting clothing, but this was the exact opposite and flared out every which way. it's got to go back.
other The fabric on this dress is gorgeous. i wish it was tailored a bit more because as it is, it looks like a muumuu. i wish it would have fit better, but i returned it.
other I tried this on as it was on sale and my size was on the store. i didn't end up buying it as it felt jsut meh compared to so many cute cardigans. i do have a couple of grey ones and tried on grey, so perhaps i jsut dind't need it... pros: short so would work with dresses and high waist.
other This is the 4th pair of current/elliot jeans i've bought.  i'm 5'other so the length is perfect for flats.  they are so soft and cozy. wish they had a design on the pockets but love them none the less!
other This dress looked ok in the hanger, but oh my on was so much better. quality is great, i love the fabric and that it has pockets.i'm 5'8 and normally a ddd usually a large too...so i worried about the size - the medium fits great everywhere
other This is longer than i thought it would be- but again i'm petite! i ordered the grey and it's more of a grey green color that is absolutely beautiful. it is such a cute and easy top to wear!
other Very light weight and soft fabric. i bought the blue but did not try green or grey. i love blue with my skin tone and am afraid green may make my skin look yellow. did not see the green in my store though. very comfy and flattering dress. runs tts.
other I'm really looking forward to wearing this skort on vacation in hawaii. it's a great color, soft, flowy, fun, practical.
other Finding pants off the rack that fit me is always a challenge - i'm petite (5' 1'), a bit curvy and short-waisted, so many of today's low-rise styles just do not work for me. however, these pants are a better cut and come pretty close to a perfect fit - comfortable and flattering, too. i've actually had pretty good luck with pilcro pants. i always have some gapping in the waist, but it's not much of an issue with these. more than likely whatever top i wear will hide that part. i was advised by th
other This is the first romper i have have purchased and is so cute! i am in between a small and a medium usually (5'7, 13other lbs and athletic). the medium fit okay, but with some extra fabric--the small fit better and was much more flattering. the romper feel well-made. can't wait to wear it!
other These pants have a really cute design. however, they are a bit short (and i'm only 5'4"). i'm still happy i purchased them, but i thought i was purchasing full length pants (as shown on the model) and not capris.
other Beautiful white top. peplum never looged good on me until i found this one. i am 5.4, 3other dd and this peplum looked good on me. most white tops are see through int he front and this one isn't. but back is a little see through. for casual that much see though is good. not sure for office. but this is still a keeper for me :)
other This is adorable!  lots of compliments on color.  great fit!
other Versatile and fun dress. color is better in person than picture. looks great with jeans jacket for chilly moments. doesn't wrinkle on long airplane trip and rolls up teeny-tiny for packing!
other So glad i purchased this tunic! just lovely. can see myself reaching for it constantly this summer. necklace friendly too!
other I have been searching for a comfortable pair of flared jeans to wear with tennis shoes or flats. i have tried several different brands and these are amazing! they are super soft and comfortable with just the right amount of stretch. the coloring is excellent for the casual look i am going for. the pocket detailing is cute and helps to flatter your bottom. i am 5'2" so these were very long but nothing a good seamstress can't fix. i will note that cutting of that much of the bottom will reduce som
other This is the first hd in paris top i haven't loved. high hopes for this top since i love the brand and the color. this was an online only item so i guessed at the size, typically order a other petite. ordered the other regular since the length was already quite short in the regular length. it was oddly constructed, small in the arms but boxy and oddly bell shaped bottom. the lining was tough to keep straightened while trying to put iton. too bad, but it went back
other I'm 5'9 and 150 pounds and got a medium. the cut is very flattering on me and i have received many compliments when i wear it. it is lined, so no need to wear a cami underneath.
other This jacket is well-made and smart looking. it gave me just the boost i needed today at a difficult meeting. thank you retailer!
other This dress is not form fitting and some might consider it a little "shapeless". however, the color is stunning, the quality is great, and its a great dress for a wedding where you want to stand out but not have to worry about anything too constricting. great for dancing the night away - the under layer and frill at the bottom are perfect. i am very pleased with this purchase!
other This cover-up is perfect for the beach or the pool. it is see through.
other I ordered a medium in this and it definitely fits more like a large. i liked the color & the sleeves, but tying the tie at the neck looks silly on me and leaving it open shows too much cleavage. overall, it is just shapeless and too much fabric on me. i'm sending this one back.
other A really beautiful, well made dress. runs extremely big though! i'm not petite by any means and ordered a large but i'm positively swimming in it. an oversized look works for this particular dress, but i think it's supposed to be more fitted so i would recommend sizing down from what you might normally expect for a piece of this style.
other This hoodie was too thin. you can see right through it. i returned it.
other I am so in love with this top. can be worn on or off the shoulders. the color is amazing!
other I wasn't sure about this shirt at first glance, it's difficult to see in the picture but the top of the shirt and the peplum are two completely different fabrics, with the top having a much looser weave. however, it looks great on. the blue color is very saturated and pretty. the fit in the shoulders and arms is stretchy and comfortable. and it hangs in a really flattering and comfy way on my hourglass frame. i'm pretty busty, 36dd i think....i usually have to wear l in retailer tops unless they'r
other This dress is one of my new favorites. i usually wear a medium petite but had to size down in order to get it to fit properly. i was able to get the green one, while visiting in san francisco. i wish more stores had a petite section! it was great to be able to try things on!!!
other I love jumpsuits for their style and comfort. i loved the look of this blue silky piece, and the review that said it was like lounge wear you could wear out of the house. i agree that it is like lounge wear, but for me, there were a few challenges.first, the fit was small. i am usually anywhere between a other and a 6 depending on style, cut and brand. i tried the small in this and it was not a flowy look or feel. it was restrictive in the hip area in a way that would make me not want to wear th
other I love this shirt, love love love it. i am a curvy girl and it accents all the right features and hides the ones that need to be hidden.but i've owned it for 6 months and there are already other holes in the shirt. and not holes in the fabric but holes on the seam lines. the stitching is not sturdy enough for the shirt to not fall apart. the whole point is to be able to wear it. but now i have to bust out my sewing machine to reinforce the seams that split so that i can wear it again. :(
other This top runs huge. not only in the torso/chest area but the sleeves on this were enormous and the shoulder area was very puffy. i am normally between a m-l but would have to get a small or extra small to make it work.
other Love this top. yes it is a swing top so you have to be prepared for the extra fabric. fits true to size thru the shoulders and chest. body of the top then flares for the "swing" effect. great top. plan on ordering it in the other colors.
other Adorable peasant fitting top.  not too voluminous, just right for over jeans, and really cute with shorts.  the detail makes it wearable for dress up or down, and the cut is classic!
3 This blazer is a nice weight for summer. it is more terracotta than rose, but is still a nice color. the fit is tts and flattering. however, the buttons were almost falling off the one i received. i didn't take this as a sign of great quality and plan to return it.
other I bought the xs and love it. it looks better on than in the picture. it travels well (no wrinkles after being in the suitcase) and it is generous on the sides so you can actually eat a full lunch and not feel boxed in afterwards.
3 I love the material of this shirt and i love the design; however, there is just too much fabric. it felt very boxy and gave me no shape at all. for someone who is petite this just wasn't flattering. i love the design idea though!
other Super cute!! will be buying another color of this tee.
other The skirt is not as form fitting as i had hoped. it is a lot of material that is flowy and billowy, not straight and pencil-like as shown as in the pictures. the material and design is just okay- not super wowed by it. i did size down but feel like i might need to size down even more to get more of a fitted look.
other These culottes are comfortable and cool. i am a size 8-10 and am 5' 4" tall. i ordered the medium. the hemline hits me a little bit longer than the model. also they are more of a bell shape on me rather than kind of a straight pant as shown on the model. the pockets are great!
other This is a lovely dress. it is on the heavy side and lined, so i would not recommend for hot summer wear. but the material and style are adorable. the skirt is definitely a-line, not sheath, but i prefer that. it runs a tad too tight in the chest, so if you're between sizes in the bust, i'd order up. that said, a 6 would be too big for me. i'm 5'4, 120 lbs and 34c and usually wear a 4.
other The stone color was nice, but the material is heavy and doesn't breath. if you are partial to more natural fabrics i would go with a different item. upside would be that i imagine this shirt will last.
other Great fitted tee. nice styling. hard to find tees that are fitted-- they seem to make most of them these days like boxes i suppose because it's easier to make. this looks great and feels good. true to size. loving it!
other This definitely works for you - think fabric, great quality, and i'm 2other weeks and i think i'll be able to use this to the end. got my normal-ish size. would never have kept this if i wasn't pregnant, cause you can definitely accommodate a pregnancy (or maybe go down two sizes if not). this is not my first baby either! love for my pregnancy.
other I purchased this sweater in the grey and loved it.much prettier in person, the photos do not show the delicate details, which are lovely.i found that it fits true to size and has a very flattering fit.it is also a very versatile piece depending on what you pair it with.i love it so much that i purchased the peach and wine colors as well.i found all 3 colors beautiful and each gives this sweater a different look.the grey is sophisticated and works well with almost anything.the peach is del
other I loved this top when i first saw it online and it did not disappoint when i received it in the mail. it's very lightweight, perfect for spring, cool summer night, early fall. i really like the design and like that you can tuck it in. there is enough fabric in the front to give it a "flowy" look that i appreciate bc i will be giving birth soon and my post baby body will likely need some coverage! great top!
3 This sweater is great i bought the black version on sale. my complaint is the pulling factor though. you don't expect retailer sweaters to pill after a couple wears. overall i love the fit and look though so i continue to overlook it and use my sweater comb as needed!
other This is the 2nd time i've purchased a dolan top and returned it b/c it was dry clean only. both tops were what i consider to be casual tops to be worn with a pair of jeans, running errands, etc. i do not dry clean this kind of casual shirt. it is made out of rayon, and that's the problem i think.i purchased this in the wine color and it is a lovely color, hangs nicely, doesn't cling. the sleeves are a bit long but i could live with that -- i just pushed them up. as a turtleneck, it was a bit l
other I love a crisp white poplin blouse and this top is perfect in that role. i am between a small and medium in retailer tops. because this top looked a little bell in the model photos, i decided to order a 6. it was a bit snug across the chest. for reference, i am a 34c. i returned it for the 8 and it fit perfect. i'm not sure why this top was offered during the winter because it will likely hang in my closet until april. highly recommend this blouse for summer.
3 This is a beautiful dress. all that's missing is a bonnet!
other I decided to splurge. i would not normally spend $200 for a pair of jeans, but when they went on sale, i decided to go for it. i am so glad that i did. mother has a customer for life. these jeans are the best by far. i normally wear a size other (27) in most jeans, but wear a 28 in j brand and some others. so i was a little nervous by previous reviewers not just on this website. i decided to go with the 28 since in mother brand this is actually a 4/6. they fit great!
3 I think these jeans are good for people with long lean legs. i'm 5'7" 15other lbs and the wide cuff made my legs look short and stubby. the weight of the jeans is a little on the heavier side - i usually like soft denim. i usually wear a 3other and thought they were true to size.
other I was walking by my local retailer and saw this in the window and loved the colors. it's a great combination and looks good with white jeans, and regular denim. i like the cuffs on the sleeves and the textured material. it is a kimono - so in essence it is not form fitting. it's meant to flow over whatever else you have on. i purchased the xs/s and i am a normal size other and it looks cute. i got lots of compliments when i wore it! there are slits on either side at the bottom hem as well which allow
other So versatilei tried this on in my usual regular 0, but it was way too long at the shoulders, large in the bust(i am 32b), and a tad too long overall. i ordered the 0p and it fits perfectly! can wear this year round and looks great with or without a belt. pockets would have made it even better, but still love it.
other I tried this on in the store because i have had my eye on it for a while and i want to be sure i get the correct size. as other reviewers have said, it does run large. i normally wear a s and the xs was big on me. i could go with the xxs, but of course it appears to be sold out now. the lighter colors look like they would be slightly sheer, but the navy blue and red are not. i thought the material was good quality. not sure if it would shrink. top is rather long on the back, but the picture does
3 Beautifully made. beautiful drape. deep  blue. so long tho i have to role it up at the waist so nix on tucking a white blouse in. why is it so long???? in 5'6" and got a large. with other inch heels i still trip and not about to wear really high herls. ill keep it tho because its a nuce dressy skirt. may take it to be hemmed but the last item i got hemmed ended up an uneven mess
other This dress got my attention in the store due to the bright color. it's like a tangerine orange that absolutely shouts summer. loved the asymmetrical hem and another plus was the pockets! they look completely hidden so the dress does fall flat. i thought this ran a little big in the chest area, which doesn't happen often. a size 8 worked for me, can't wait to wear this!
other The dress is extremely high quality! i purchased the dress in black. the white collared shirt that the model is wearing under the dress is not part of the dress. the dress overall is like a balloon. unless you're extremely tall and skinny this dress makes you look bigger! i ordered the small petite and am 12other lbs and 5'4. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it's going back:( the petite hits 3 inches above the knee for reference.
other This dress fits perfectly and is travels wonderfully through the seasons! the color and cut is really flattering and flows nicely!
other My favorite jeans i have ever purchased! they fit just right. i wear them everywhere.
3 This is a heavy dress - it's surprising when you lift up the hanger how much it weighs because it looks like a light sundress. and on my frame, which is pretty thin, it hits my shoulders and then my hips and just falls... so the heft of it means there's no waistline... it's an odd fit. the color is gorgeous, but the lack of shape made this a no.
other I love this t-shirt! it is so soft, fits true to size and great with jeans or shorts. i purchased in yellow and plan to purchase other colors!
other The fabric and detailing of this dress is of superior quality, but unfortunately it runs huge-- you definitely need to wear a tank or cami underneath. i am 5'9 145lbs with massive shoulders/smaller bust and i got the xs petite!
other Love the shirt! fits great and is so cute! a must have for fall!
other Wonderful fabric. surprisingly great fit. super flattering. i'm so glad i bought it, despite jumpsuits being a bit of a risk online.
other This is a great top and it fit me very nicely but it's much longer than it appear to be in the picture. i'm 5'other and it was more like a tunic than a tank on me. if it were shorter it would be one of my favorite staples i'm sure. if you're very tall i think you will love it.
other This is not a kimono. it's a cocoon. there's a huge difference.it's also not made very well.
other I love the neckline on this - sharp enough for work, but cute for a fun night out too. only complaint is it's soooo flowy on the bottom. i could hide a baby under here for sure. i got the medium thank goodness or it would have been ridiculous. i'm 5'8, 160lbs. great for fall.
other I promised myself only one pair of joggers this year, and these were the ones i went with (in the blue motif). for me the tipping point was the quality and fit of these were far superior than the others i tried, while still being machine washable. the fabric has aa little substance, yet is still lightweight and comfortable. the fit has a perfect bit of tailoring/tapering to be ultra-flattering while having the comfort of pajama pants. the blue motif is adorable too - love the geometric shapes. l
other I was expecting these to be the normal thickness of everyday leggings, plus fleece. instead, they're more like thicker-than-average tights. still warm, though there's a weird seam on the inside of the thighs that takes away from some of the comfort. not so bad that i want to return them, but not what i was hoping for, either.
other Love these leggings. great fit, great look. perfect with boots and oversized sweater. bought a couple of different fabrics. highly recommend.
other Fits great! love soft material. love with skinny jeans brown boots
other There's no doubt that this tee is sheer. i found that a nude bra is sufficient in overcoming the issue. the fit is true to size, with just enough room for drape without being too oversized. the beachy theme will be perfect come warm weather!
other I really loved this skirt on the model. i ordered it in my typical 0 and it fit well. the green was adorable, and the buttons are rose gold, which is quite pretty. i did exchange this skirt for a 2, only because the 0 was just too short for me. if the other is a bit longer but not terribly huge in the waist, i will probably keep it. i was surprised by how large the a line felt, but i think i can get used to it. it really is very fun, and very easy to dress up or down. i'm really hoping the bigger si
other When i first tried on this romper, i grabbed a 6 (my normal size) but because of my bust size, i could not even get the top half to cover me at all. i decided to give this romper another go a month later, and tried on the 8...it made all the difference! i love it, it fits amazing, and it is just too cool.
other I am very particular about jeans. it's not just the look; it;s the feel and the quality of the fabric that won me over. the mid-rise wide-leg crop is perfection. i'm 5'7" and a size 8. these are extremely flattering and versatile to go casual or incorporate into a more professional feel. great way to show off some of the fabulous fall footwear options as well. i highly recommend.
other I adore maeve tops, and this is no exception. i'm small on top (32a), ordered my usual maeve size 0. i'm 5'3, 10other lbs, ordered regular (not petite) because the front of this blouse is already short. fits appropriarely, but take note it is much more blousy than it appears in the photo. you have to try it on, either you'll love it or hate it. i do love it's slightly oversized blousy fit, so i was not hesitant to put it in the dryer on low for about 15-20 minutes. well... it shrunk up like nothing
other A must for every closet. very flattering fit - although i think the white is slightly boxier than the chambray.
other I'm very glad i snatched this up when i did. it is super soft and the perfect length. i love the slight peplum as it makes for a very flattering fit. i can tell this shirt will be a staple year round as it works great with shorts or jeans. for me, i think the large was a tiny bit big in the waist, but it might shrink in the wash. the armholes were nice too, and didn't gap.
3 I was excited to try something by this designer and decided to order size large. unfortunately, this top just looked very odd. cute from the front but it wings out in the back where the sleeves meet the arms. the fabric makes an odd poof in that area. i do have a large bust and it didn't pull anywhere in the front. i expected it to be soft and drapey but the cotton feels very coarse and doesn't drape well. it covered my behind in back. unfortunately it made me look wide from the side view. i hav
other This is probably a blouse for curvy women. with that i mean large breasted. i am a 40d and the xl fits well and the cleavage is in the limit of ok for the office. the bottom is a little too large but not too long. however, the fabric feels extremely comfortable and it stretches but it doesn't lose the shape. i am tempted to buy other more. if you are thin, you probably need to size down.
other I just purchased these pants in red on sale. i am 5/5", 143 pounds, and the 10 fit perfectly (i am either an 8 or a 10 in pants, depending upon brand). it is really hard for me to find pants that are cute, unique, work-appropriate, and flattering. these pants fit the bill in all aspects. i thought i would prefer the black, but am really glad i got the red.
other Just purchased this yesterday in the store and i can't wait to wear it! it is a perfect spring/summer top when you just want to wear something pretty and comfortable! i agree that it is big but that is the style of this shirt. so if you're ok with this look, you will love this shirt! i took my usual medium and the prints are adorable! a great addition to my wardrobe!
other This top is very cute, very flattering, and very unique! love the high/low back! also very comfy, would recommend to anyone!
3 Purchased these pants that i had quickly tried on. when i got home, i re-tried them and felt they were too snug and the material had an odd feel and did not lay right. i took them back and tried them in the next size. they fit much better but the material did not lay well on me. i think that they are a bit too stretchy and ended up not buying the larger ones either. i would definitely recommend trying these in a store rather then ordering online.
other Perfect crop jeans with just a tiny flare. i'm a size 8 and the 29s fit perfectly.
other There were only other pairs left in my store and they had my size! they are super comfortable and easy to wear with anything on top because of the navy embroidery being such a classic color. i would definitely recommend. i may buy the floral embroidery ones too.
3 The style of this dress is quite lovely, i immediately gravitated towards it when i saw in the store, however once i tried it on it looked like a sack of potatoes...unfortunately the loose silhouette did not do anything for my figure, i should mention that i am 5'9" and have an athletic figure but with hips. the design is very on trend and the dress does have some lovely details like the lace around the hip area and flowy fabric. but unfortunately it was not enough for me to purchase. also the
other Feels a bit more tunic than blouse but it's a lovely piece all the same.
other From the photos, i thought the design was embroidered. in reality, it is stamped on. there is a tiny bit of embroidery and a few sequins, but overall, the design is just printed on the fabric. i didn't feel it looked good, in fact it looked kind of cheap to me, so i returned it. the overall style of the jacket was great and it would have looked equally good for work or casual. i was disappointed it didn't work out.
other This robe is so pretty, i kind of feel like a movie star when i wear it! the embroidered flowers and trim are a very nice touch. the fabric is very light and soft, i'm sure it will feel nice and cool on those hot summer nights ahead. the fit is true to size and is actually a bit longer than what is shown on the model. i am extremely happy i decided to make this purchase.
other Lovely, flowing dress w a boho vibe. pretty design and fabric. agree w comments re stiff slip fabric but will keep it anyway. should be a great summer dress
other I bought this to wear in the warm climates, when you go indoors it is always freezing. i also travel a lot and wanted something light weight to wear on the plane and airport. wore it the first day all day with jeans and top. lots of compliments. i was worried that driving in the car, it would get torn or snagged. didn't! loved it so much, going to by another one similar and have on again!
other The larkspur tank is colorful and the embroidered bib is beautiful. the material is soft but not diaphanous. it can hide my little pouch without looking like maternity clothing. love it!
other Bought the red/white. normally a size small but they were out so tried a medium. it fit perfectly. and feels amazing. love how it hangs and know i will get lots of compliments on this! jeans, white linen pants, very versatile how this can be warn.
other This dress makes you feel like a little kid. it certainly helps that it is an excellent twirling dress, for sure. i wish it had a little more definition to the waist--it just barely works for larger chested women, definitely on the line from being a little too baby doll shapeless. the colors are so beautiful and the fabric so light that it's hard to pass this one up. it's just too beautiful. i recommend it, but it's probably not for everyone.
3 I didn't realize it had a tie around the waist. it seems too much material hanging in the front to tie at the waist. unfortunately the sash is attached and cannot be removed. it's very cute; just not for me.  i will have to return (but sure i can find something else)!
other I've been wearing this very comfortable and cute coat for other weeks. it is already tearing at the seams somehow. the quality of this is very poor.
other Didn't like the dress. look pregnant in it. this dress is going back.
3 This is a very light, flowy dress. the lining is very fitted, but the dress is actually not fitted. it has a nice flow, but hits right at the thigh area before flowing out. plan to wear it to work.the color is very bright and pretty.
other I tried this dress on on a whim and will definitely be getting it! the fit was perfect as it is not to structured so its really a more relaxed piece even though it doesnt look it... but the way you feel when you wear it is just magical!! i love this dress!!!
3 I wanted this dress to work so badly but if you have any chest or any hips this won't work for you. i tried in petites and regular and it just didn't work at all
other I loved this dress when it came out this summer but it quickly became impossible to get. i snagged up this one as quickly as i could when it came out. i don't really love any of the fall colors it was offered in, but for this one - i would say it is much more rust and less orange in person.
other I technically measure to a medium in both regular and petite sizing, but i took a chance an ordered the regular small in red. it is as depicted, and i agree that it is soft and can be clingy, but the regular size fits slightly too big on me. this is fine since it would show lumps otherwise. i bet this would be perfect had the petite size have been available. nonetheless, the fabric is substantial enough that it doesn't show the fact i carry weight in my upper body and stomach, so i'm keeping it.
other This sweater is far more slouchy and relaxed in fit than in it seems in the photograph. definitely size down. honestly, i kinda love it anyways! the inside is so very soft, and it's perfect for a sleek errand-running or hiking kind of day!
3 Very cute coat but could not keep it for the price...just not sure it is worth almost $200,00 (with tax added to cost). when it goes on sale, i will most likely buy it.
other I wanted to love this shirt. the fit was a little off and i wish it had come in a little at the waist to be more figure flattering before it flared out. the fabric is nice but wrinkles easily and in the white is see through.. sadly i will be returning.
other This is my go to, cool, summer dress. it's very light and airy and extremely comfortable. great for 90 degree days!highly recommend!
other I've worn this dress to work with a black corset belt and to disneyland as is. it's made of a medium weight knit that doesn't cling. the cut is flattering. i wish they had an option with no slits. though this alternate cut would be significantly less comfortable, it would create a sexier silhouette. i purchased this item on sale.i'm a little worried that it'll shrink in the wash. i've had varied luck with fabric containing modal.
other These pants are great, super cute and comfy. the price is too high but i do love them.
3 It's hard enough for women to find clothing that will make them look as beautiful as they feel but add a bigger bust size (i'm a 36dd) and it makes it this much harder. i ordered this top because of how beautiful it looked on the model and the price. when it arrived i was so excited! retailer does such a beautiful job with the way they handle their items! it was wrapped beautiful and no damage. i ordered a size 8 knowing that my chest could be a potential problem. the too itself is gorgeous! i did
other So comfortable and warm! so nice to lounge in a cold day and be cute!
other I thought from the picture this would be a light floaty top. when it arrived, the fabric was a heavy knit and the neckline sagged very low. on me (granted i'm a pear) the bottom layer hugged my tummy and rear in a very unflattering way. the only thing i liked was the color. back it went.
other This is one of my favorite recent retailer purchases. i wore it to work and a presentation. many people commented on how much they loved my top, and then turned back around to take a second glance to realize it wasn't paisley but leopards and tiger prints. it's really fun and fits well. great for work or dressed down with jeans.
other I bought this blouse at the store today and i love it! they stylist brought it for me to try on with the green chinos and it was perfect. it will go with jeans or dark pants as well. very unique and flattering! i got a size 2. i'm 5'7'" and 130 pounds.
other First, this picture does not do this shirt justice. in fact, the hanger does not do this shirt justice. you must try this shirt on! it drapes so well. not as soft as some cloth & stone tops, but it is still very soft. the slightly stiffer feel makes it easier to dress up. there's no pockets, which is nice in a button down. it drapes in a very flattering way. i've never been happier with a cloth&stone garment. i normally wear a small in this brand, and that is true for this top as well. however,
other This is a really pretty top. the beading/rivet detail is really cool and it feels comfortable on. i think the lining is really silky and the lace feels gentle, not stiff. the top is kind of like a swing top, there is a lot of fabric, but it is just right. the fabric looks rich and lovely. great top!
other I was nervous to order the pants because i didn't think they looked great on the model in the picture. they are by far, my new favorite pants. the fabric is so soft and stretchy, yet hugs my curves doesn't stretch out during the day. i was expecting the fabric to be thick or stiff, but it is very lightweight, yet professional for work. the cut is perfect--i wanted black culottes but i'm only 5'5" so a lot of them overwhelm me. these are fitted at the top and gradually looser through the thighs a
other I am 5'3", 28/38 and got the sp. had no issues whatsoever, and love the colors.
other It's a pretty dress, my only concern is the sleeve length. it's an awkward length and makes the dress look a little frumpy. i turned the sleeve up once and it looks so much better!. or, if you are a savvy sewer, you may want to tighten a little in the arms so the sleeve is a bit more fitted. overall quality and feel is very good. i usually fit into a 6, but for this dress i ordered both 6 and 8 and kept the 8. the chest is a bit snug and the button pops open if you don't order the correct size.
other I thought this top would be a little more form fitting than it is. there is so much extra fabric near the bottom it is almost like a swing style top. the fabric will most definitely snag, as it is not a linen or cotton top material but rather a silky type and also very thin - not very good quality. i got the smallest size possible and it was absolutely huge, everywhere but the neck.
other Wow! love this skirt! and i totally agree with reviewers--this item runs a full size small. i am normally a true six on bottom and it was a bit too tight considering i would wash/dry/shrink. the size eight is perfect. fabric is very good twill and forgiving... $19.9other and 40% off!!! cannot wait to wear my bargain skirt next summer!!!
other Bought my 3rd pair of pilcro cords in the dark turquoise. the other other are from previous seasons. love these pants for fall because they are extremely comfortable and stylish. the dark turquoise was paired with the poppy tunic (in blue) at my local store. i liked the pairing and ended up buying both! i find these to fit true to size vs other items at retailer that fit larger. i am a 29 (8) while in most other pants at retailer, i am a 6. i am 5'7 and 13other lbs.
other Soft and sweet
3 Got this in the mail today and while the design is cute, it's not as soft and comfortable as i would like. the front clasp takes a bit of practice to get on and off. the straps are a bit thin and hurts a bit.
other I love the fit of the stevie jean. they are not too tight to make them inappropriate for a mom/teacher, but are definitely not your momma's jeans either. i have two pair (gray and a dark denim) and both fit perfectly after a wash. however, the waist stretches out throughout the day enough that i have to wear a belt which i never do! i could probably size down, but i didn't want the thighs to be too tight. for reference i'm 5'2" 130 lbs. and wear a pretty standard 2, sometimes 4. i bought these i
other I bought this in black and it did require me to wear a shirt underneath as it was a little sheer/see through. i usually wear an xs and i wore the same in this top. the black is very pretty and goes well with some skinny jeans.
other This is a nice, simple, understated sweater. i got the green and the navy and they look different enough to keep both. it''s a throw-it-on-over-a-shirt sweater, with the right length to let whatever is underneath show. and the ribbon tie on the back is a nice touch.i also like that the width of the sweater is an alternative to everything that's cut so tightly fitted - it's a nice width, with some room, without being boxy.
3 Looks better online than in person. material makes it look a little puffy
other I love this shirt! i received many compliments on it when i wore it to work with a skirt.
other This blouse is quite stiff. i wouldn't mind the boxiness if this blouse weren't so long. even if you size down, because of the eyelet and the cute hem, it would be difficult to shorten this blouse to fit.
other It is a beautiful dress, light and delicate. i got my usual xsmall ( 5'4" 34c, 13other lbs). it comes with a slip and the slip is a bit fitted. it worked for me, but i can see this being an issue. it can easily be resolved with any other ivory or nude slip. it is worth it. very cute dress.
other I've been a fan of the pilcro chinos for years but the jeans have not been the right fit for me - usually wind up too big in the waist to accommodate the hips. well the em is aptly named as they are made to fit a girl! ! i usually wear a 29 and the 29 fit comfortably and i could probably even go down a size. thank you retailer - please make more in this style!
other This shirt is comfy, fits well, the color (pink or dusty rose) works well with most outfits, but the front hook is ill-placed and often visible. it could be tucked under better so as not to show, but it isn't and does show. i feel that i frequently need to fluff it up to hide the hook. otherwise, i like it, but i wouldn't have bought it unless it was on discount, which it was.
other I had this on my birthday list and was really hopeful that it'd work out based on all of the good reviews. when i got it, i was happy with the fit and fabric, but i was stumped as to what i'd wear it with. it hung in the closet for a couple of weeks because i just didn't know if i could pull off the length. i took the plunge today and find it pairs nicely with a flared leg pant and simple shirt underneath. it's so stretchy, warm, and cozy! the sweater does shed as another reviewer mentioned so k
other This anorak is perfection! perfect weight, color, and the style is super easy to wear. i found this to fit true to size and not oversized at all. i'm 5"3, 130lbs, 32d with an average build/frame and i took a size small. i can comfortably wear a long sleeved shirt underneath or even a thin sweater. i think xs would have been too tight in the shoulders/bust. it fits perfectly and i love the inner drawstrings that you can pull to give it a little more shape. i got this during the 30% off promo!
other Love, love, love this shirt! much like last year's bordeaux shirt in this style, it's very soft, very flattering, and very comfortable. fits tts, and the fabric is a very soft, stretchy cotton, yet not too clingy around the mid section (it has a nice, flowy fit#. it washes great, doesn't pill #again, the fabric is fantastic), and holds up really well. i bought the black with white stripes this year, but i'm tempted to get every color. it's great for layering too since the fabric is nice and thin
other I love the look of this dress when it's on. the only issue i have with it is that the inside of the dress is white, which shows through on the chest slightly, but it's such a pretty dress and such an overall great fit, that i'm keeping it anyway!
other This dress is beautiful--lovely colors and design--but it's huuuge. i'm usually a s/m in tops and dresses, but i got an xs after trying it on in the store. i'm busty and have hips and still have a bit of room. the length is good--a little above the knee but still work appropriate. with my curves it's not my most flattering dress since it pretty much falls straight down, but i think it's too pretty not to keep.
other I tried this dress at the store today and couldn't leave without it. also tried the pacquerette shirtdress which has a similar boho/peasant vibe and overall preferred the fit and look of this one. plus, its lined, which the paquerette shirtdress is not for the same price. fit was very similar to the anwen peasant dress, which i also have, and the regular size xs fit me much the same as in that dress. it is maybe other inch longer though, but still that makes it a couple of inches above the knee for
other I initially liked the feel and quality of the top but once it was on it was much shorter and looser than the picture of the model. it flowed out from my chest with one central pleat in the front and my husband said it made me look pregnant. then came the tedious task of taking it off with such a snug fit in the shoulders. i'm regularly a size 2/xs, 32d and 120 lbs and both size other and other did not work for me.
other This jumper is so much more flattering than it appears in the product photo! i am not sure why it was paired in a way that made it look so wintery- and did not play up on the capri length and interesting artsy top! i am a curvy other or a 6, smaller on top, with hips. i love this fit. it it pulls in at a high waist, with a stretch in the pants---it's just adorable! i would say that the top portion is quite fitted- it's not a stretchy material, more of a textured thick fabric- so that is somethin
other I got this skirt in the dove grey, which is a lovely shade of light grey and silver. it has one layer underneath that is a sparkly silver netting which is really pretty that you can't see in the photo. the other layer is the grey netting. it has a very soft light grey silky cotton liner. i got the petite xs and it fits just as it should. i'm 5'3, 102. the skirt looks just as it is pictured, i think it can be dressy or dressed down a bit. very very pretty and well made. i'm happy with the purchas
other This was surprisingly more complimentary and easier to wear than i though it would be. i love vix bathing suits and the quality is exceptional!
other I loved this dress when i saw it in the store. the colors, weight, fabric. love. love. love. unfortunately i have to agree with other reviewers, the pockets and the positing of the draw string made my hips look unflatteringly large. i tried on a size 0 petite, which is my usual size. all flowed nicely except for when you get to the pockets. truly disappointed as it was beautiful in every other way. but in the end, i had to pass.
other Perhaps it is the 69's vibe that hit me, but i had to check this out with the free shipping week. i am so glad that i did!i fear wool as i have sensitive skin but this is soft and snuggly. the structure will allow for fit over many different types of under-layers, but unlike so much offered lately, it is not huge or tent-like, but a perfect fit. it is a heavier weight - light coat weight? this is perfect for me in the south. the color is as pictured, golden. in my xxs petite, the sleeves are p
other I'm other 9 with a slender build but have always found rompers to not be figure flattering.  however this one was perfect! not too short nor long and looks great! highly recommend!!
other I bought the fuschia colored tank to wear under a sweater for the fall. great color. fits well.
other I'm 5'7", 130 lbs. i ordered a medium-regular. the dress fell three inches above my knees. this model is taller than i am, and it falls to her knees....doesn't make sense. i think retailer sends petites in place of regular.
other Beautiful choice...beautiful fit for my daughter's slim body
other Much softer fabric than i expected. wrinkles easily.
other I wore this tunic everyday on vacation in hawaii. runs a little small, i'm usually a small and the x-small was just right. perfect length, short but not too short.
other This dress is very flattering on and can easily be dressed up or down. i was nervous it might be too flowy, but it lays very nice and is so pretty on!
other I love this dress because it's so comfortable and has this hippie peasant vibe that i don't generally wear. plus it's a three season dress with pockets! bought the medium but i should have sized down to a small. on top i'm a m/l girl and the medium is huge. i'm not going to exchange since i wear a sweater over it right now. this dress looks good with or without a belt, with long boots, booties and sandals. so happy with this purchase!
3 I was so excited to get this! the fabric is beautiful - comfy soft and a great wash/print of blue. it reminded me of the ocean. however, the fit was off. the waist was too high, the length too short, and the straps to long. i was very disappointed. i considered taking it to the tailor before returning. ultimately, i decided to return.
other A lovely, creatively designed tunic that just isn't for me.  the embroidery is certainly intricate and the chambray shirt has a wearable hand, but the combination on my body type didn't look quite right, probably because i am too top heavy and apple torsoed.  i think if i were more slender, the fit would look like a flattering dress.  i had purchased the size 10 and i am 36dd 140#.
other For reference i am 5'5' 138 lbs with an hourglass figure and my usual small fit perfectly. the problems: 1. this skirt is not black but a charcoal gray/purple. 2. the sipper is reinforces with a stiff boarder on the inside so no matter where i put the waist it sticks straight out making me look like i have a tail under my skirt. in other words, i had a very pointy butt. also the slit or tulip part of the skirt goes all the way up to the waist, it needed to be tacked to the other part of the skir
other Best dress ever maeve does it again! tts and can be worn all 3 seasons here in sacramento love it and can be worn with a denim jacket or cardigan!
other I absolutely loved this dress when i first saw it. the fit was not quite what i expected. i usually sport a 0 or 2, but this dress wouldn't zip up all the way in a 2, so i return/exchanged it for a 4.
other Cute dress but way too big. i ordered a other petite and i'm swimming in it. i'm usually a size 2-other and 5'4".will exchange for smaller size since i think it would be really great if fit properly.
other I ordered the red and am watching for my size in the green to come back into stock. i was already expecting my bra straps to be exposed, not a big deal as with shoulder length hair it covers them so i found this top to be exactly as pictured/described. it fits like it looks on the model and i thought the color to be spot on. i have washed it once in the washer on cold and dried only for a few minutes on low as i like to do with delicate knits to regain shape and i think it looks as good as it di
3 So, i bought other of these. first in xsp. it was actually the regular length not the petite one. it did have the problem mentioned by others regarding the arms, armpit, thighness issue. i thought maybe the dress was mislabeled and i got a regular xs by mistake. so i returned and order another xsp hoping i would get one with the right length, but no. the one i got has same issues as the first one. why other petite dresses with regular length/? i think the dresses are defective. the print is gorgeous and
other This is a great quality product with unique design
3 I'm actually surprised no one has reviewed this yet. i took the plunge because it seemed like a classic wardrobe staple, nothing too flashy or fancy, that would go well with many outfits. my thoughts below:__________________pros:- fits tts. i'm normally either a 10 or 1other and got the large. it fit well and the elastic isn't too tight. fit very well for me because i have wider hips. so if you're straight or slim, you could probably size down.- exactly as pictured. it does have a nice flow
other I bought this on sale and at the sale price it is a steal. great style, feel, and fit. maybe wouldn't feel as good about it at full price, but wish i had one is every color!
other This dress is amazing. it is comfortable with great fabric and very high quality. if you have a lot of curves it may not be the best dress as it has no give and flows straight down from the shoulder.
other I really liked the design. ordered a medium which was huge. also thought i would not be able to tolerate it because of the material -- a bit itchy. returned it.
other I'm a big retailer buyer- and usually love the dresses, especially the petite xs maxis. this was the worst retailer purchase i have ever made. it was humongous and gave me no shape. even if i purchased an xxsp it probably would be the same. i'm small but i mean come on- this would only fit a giantess-- which also makes no sense because it's the petite size. do not buy. i'm very upset i have to pay the $5.9other return fee since i ordered this.
other I was so impressed with the quality of this top that i bought it in all the colors.. it is comfy and thin. i purchased my usual size . it is so adorable with the lattice stripe..
other I absolutely love everything about this dress. it can be dressed up or down. no complaints.
3 Being that i am short, 5'2", this skirt flares out way too much resembling a 50's style poodle skirt. the model in photo has her arm strategically placed thus pushing back excess fabric toward the back making it look more streamline. this skirt is not for the under 5'5". long leggy types could easily "rock" this.
other I love this tee, it is comfortable and soft with the nice detail of buttons at the shoulders, a good v-neck, and subtle stripes. however it runs quite long! i thought i ordered the petite but i received a regular length tee and it was down to my thighs. so order a petite unless you are quite tall or like a tee to fall that low over your hip area.
other This is another item i've been stalking that i thought miraculously made it to sale with my size still available. i ordered online but when it arrived i have to be honest i didn't even try it on because i knew it would be going back. the beautiful print online looks really cheap irl on the flimsy fabric. the beaded detail on neck is basically a low grade sequin trim. so much potential just executed poorly.
other I bought this in the plum & love the color. i got this in xs which is my usual size & it's a little bit baggy but i think this is the style of the sweater. the front on me is not as long as pictured but just covers the top of my pants. my daughter liked it so much she bought the exact same one.
other This kimono is absolutely wonderful. i originally purchased it for an upcoming beach vacation, but have also found it to be a great piece for my wardrobe in both hot and cold weather! goes with pretty much everything. highly recommend.
3 I received this in the mail and it looked beautiful but the zipper was broken just like one of the other reviews. normally i would just exchange but i don't know if it's worth getting another broken one.
other Cute tee. it's a casual tee with some nice detailing that gives it some style. the fabric is a good thickness. not see-through thin but light enough for warm weather. the color should match pretty much anything. nice neckline. i think it runs slightly large. i hover between a small, extra small with tops and the xs fit nicely. i do have narrow shoulders, 32dd, so women with normal to wide shoulders might prefer their usual size. i don't expect people to gush over it with compliments but it it a
other I loved this sweater as soon as i opened the package. it was soft and the colors of grey peach and white were perfect for this to were into the spring time. i am 5'3 102lbs and purchased the xs. the arm length was perfect. the sweater length hit slightly above my hips. the style of the sweater is a bit boxy, but not so much that it looks like your wearing a tent.
other This top can be dressed up or down. i got it in the blue motif. it is so cute and that wearable, washable fabric. i am a medical student so it is important for me to be able to wash my clothing and not wear things too low-cut (i.e. professionalism). this top fits the bill while still being fabulous. of course it is loose-fitting on the bottom, as the image indicates. it is a swing top. i recommend with skinny pants.
other I love this sweater! it is so comfortable and lightweight. i am always warm and i can see myself wearing this sweater without getting overheated. very flattering as well :-)
other This is huge. i thought it would be oversize but with a bit of shape. there is no shape to this and is a lot of material. i ordered an xs and typically wear an xs or s in blouses, sometimes medium in sweaters.it seamed like other sizes too big. the material is very soft and the collar is nice. there is a ribbon tie at the waist. the tie is wimpy and could be nicer. when tied, there is so much fabric the is gathers and looks like i have no waist.
other Lovely, airy fabric and colors true to the pictures online. i am 5'3" and 118lb. i ordered a regular s, and it fits fine. yes, it is midi length, coming to about 3" below my knee. i would have preferred the 39" length if it had been available, but it was not. still, i will compensate by wearing higher heels :-) the embroidered embellishment along the neck and sides stands out more than in the pic, and really makes this dress special. the cutaway shoulders give it sophistication. if you want to a
other This is a nice looking skirt. the corduroy has a little sheen to it. looks cute with a sweater, tights and boots. length is slightly longer on me than the model in the photo. there are small slits at the side seams and the hem is curved at the slits.
3 The fit is a little bit odd, it is short and wide, too much fabric. the quality is not good, the buttons can easily break and the stitching was falling apart. i am returning it.
other Runs small in the chest, so don't order if you are large chested! over all, very cute.
other Wore this dress last weekend in nyc. wore it from lunch until late night drinks after dinner. walked for hours in the dress. comfortable but dressy.
other Sometimes i order things online that i can hardly wait to arrive, and then once they do, i wonder if i made a mistake when ordering it. this is one of those times, and it was not my mistake. the shirt i received is not like this one. it is an xs, but it is quite large falling inches below where this one hits on the model. everyone i have shown the shirt to says that it is a denim blue color, not grey at all. it is a pretty color, but not what i thought i was ordering. i hate it when this happens
other 1. i'm 5'6" tall with a short waist and long legs, and this skirt came all the way down to my ankles. i would have kept it if it had stopped mid-calf like in the photo.2. i'm 38-32-40 and the size 1other fit me perfectly in the waist hip area, so i would say it runs true to size.3. the buttons lay nice and flat over the tummy, so that's a plus. at least you don't have to undo them to go to the bathroom.
other This top has really beautiful lace detail. the color is much deeper pink than the picture online. i ordered the xs petite and it fits fine but i like my tops longer so i wish i had gotten the regular xs instead. it is very pretty!
3 Nice dress to wear while seasons are transitioning
other I think this dress is cute! it caught my eye in the store and i got a bunch of compliments when i tried it on. i like the sunny yellow. i plan on wearing it to an outdoor wedding on the amalfi coast of italy in the spring. i am petite - 5'-2", 105lbs and purchased a size 2. i think it may run a little tight in the chest, so perhaps consider sizing up if you have average or larger breasts. i love the pockets! the fabric seems to wrinkle easily, so hopefully i won't be too rumpled after having it
other These are so comfy. i will wear them for 3 seasons. so worth it - especially on sale.
other I really like the style of this top, the open sleeves are subtle. i think it is even work appropriate in a business casual environment. it is slightly short waisted in my opinion and runs a little small, but my usual medium worked for me. i am a solid 8.
other Just got this dress in the orange print and i can't begin to say how much i love it!! looks even better in person than online and it's super flattering. love the neckline, armholes are perfect and show off toned arms and shoulders ( this is the kind of dress that makes time spent at the gym worthwhile!). the fabric is light and stretchy and the pockets are an extra bonus.i would say fit is tts but keep in mind that it's very loose at the bottom so i would go down in size if you want a less loo
other This dress is so pretty in person. the colors are great - the blue and green and just beautiful in person. the fit is tts. i happen to have a blue belt and could style it just as the model has, but really it doesn't need it. it is super flattering even without a belt. i am just a hair shy of 5'5", and i cannot wear flats or it would drag the floor. but adding a other 1/2" wedge is perfect to keep it off the floor (no hemming needed). i don't usually pay full price, but i am glad i did in this case.
3 I'm glad this was on sale because i would not have purchased it at full price due to the strange fit in the sleeve. the shirt has a slight raglan sleeve, but the sleeves do not fit loosely, they kind of twist under the armpit area. i do not have large arms, so i am ok with straightening out the knit sleeves, but they do not fit right. i also was surprised at the unfinished edge along the neckline. it is messy and tacky looking, but i think that is how it was meant to be. my recommendation to buy
3 Lovely knit and so soft, but the bottom curls up underneath, similar to the bell sleeves. runs oversize too, got xs and it's too bulky and unflattering since the bottom doesn't lay flat. returned!
other As other reviewers have stated it is hard to see in the photos that the dress has iridescent blue/pink/lavender sequins. i was surprised as well but in a good way. i think it has a unique look and is so pretty and romantic. its a vision of shimmer when you are walking. if you have somewhat of a bust i would size up because the triangles run a little small. other than that its a beautiful dress.
other I tried on the xs in the store (11other lbs, 30dd chest, short). fit: i think it is a little big, i would tend to go for a xxs petite in this for me, the length was ok, but would look more flattering in petite. also, the waist was on the looser side. the green color is amazing though, very flattering and springy/summery. the flow of the dress is also very nice. the weird thing is the belt at the waist, it starts a little off from the seam, and doesn't go all the way around, not sure if i love it or
3 I actually love this dress.  the colors on the dark gray are mesmerizing.  the design of the placket adds a special touch to the look.  my issue is the way it looks on my body--not flattering.  i already have a squarish apple (squarple?!) body and the cut emphasizes this more.  i was hoping the fabric would hang on me the same way the ivory dress on the curly haired model does, so i sized up.  all this did was make me look wider, especially at the shoulders.  the drawstring at the elastic makes
other This dress is adorable. i found it to be true to size, but i do have a small bust so perhaps that helped with the sizing issue the other reviewer encountered. i love the embroidery throughout, it beautifully constructed and feels lush. i'm 5'9" and the dress falls to my ankles, but that's ok because it will look beautiful with heels or flats. i love the dress and cant wait to wear but gave it a 4-star rating because of the side zipper. it is extremely hard to zip up past your waist because of th
3 This is a pretty dress, but it runs at least one size too large. the silk is of good quality. it would be good for somebody who is slim and tall.
other This top is a keeper. subtle plaid, flowy fit. so cute with skinny jeans and booties. i would definitely recommend!
other Sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is. i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life. this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style. another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump . i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was $5.00!!!
other For me to buy a tank top it better be special and this is. flattering without being skintight, it camouflages that little back bacon you sometimes get from a bra. the v-neck is low and is the same in the back. great length, super soft and the best part is you can wear a bra! i haven't washed this yet, but based on other reviews i'll probably hand wash and air dry. the only issue is the tag flops out every now and then.
other For a blouse this beautiful and whimsical, i just can't understand why the little button loops would need to be constructed to maintain security on fort knox. i patiently worked my way through the gauntlet of them because i was determined to try it on, but ultimately, i can't see doing this again for a pricey top that shouldn't require hard labor to access. the fabric is perfect; a beautiful cotton lawn without any sheen, which really brings out the contrast of colors. it is slightly see through
other Runs a tad big but not enough to say it runs large if that makes sense - but just beautiful!
other This tunic fits exactly as shown and is so comfortable. the fabric is soft and buttery, and the lace up front is a awesome detail. happy that i went with the non-denim color because it's a gorgeous rich color that i think will transition well from season to season. love a good, cutr machine-washable tunic!
other I am 5'5. 12other pounds, size 4-ish (sometimes a 4, sometimes a 6), athletic build. these pants fit great except they are pretty large around the waist, about other extra inches of space. i don't think the problem would be fixed by sizing down since only the waist was large. i will need to get them tailored.
other If you love denim skirts as much or more than you love the perfect pair of jeans, then you'll love this one! the waist fits perfectly with just enough give from the spandex to make this skirt comfortable all day without stretching so much that you'll wonder if you should've bought a smaller size. it's also a great length for fall/winter and looks fabulous with boots. i just wish i could find the perfect buttondown shirt so i can tuck it in and show off the cute detail buckle in back!
other The jeans are the perfect high-waisted jeans. they do not stretch out and fit perfectly. the perfect length for a heel. love them all year round.
other This is beautiful - the colors are rich (though the pink is slightly more noticeable than the model image. the length was just shy of my knees at 5'7", and the fit was overall swingy. i am happy with my normal size s, though i would be curious to see how the xs fits too. i suspect that it would be too tight in the shoulders but fit everywhere else better. one major difference that slightly annoys me is that the sleeves are not long as shown in the model shot. the flared portion starts at about m
other I ordered this since it looked so cute on the model . when i it arrived, i was excited to try it on, but when i did...blah. the color is murky and the top runs large, not to mention that the material is too heavy for a short sleeved top (plus it's lined). i really wanted to like it and debated wetting it and then putting it in the dryer to shrink it a bit. in the end, i decided that it wasn't worth it. too bad, as the concept was a good one. it just failed in the execution.
other This is a very slimming, well-made, nice fitting top-i just disliked the colors. they did not look good on me. otherwise this is a very nice piece!
other These jeans are so cute! they are perfect for petites too! i am fit, look way younger than my age and get so many compliments when i wear these jeans. i'm. i'm 5'2", 11other libs and they definitely fit tight in a good way. just like the photo pretty much. they are not small like the white mother ankle fray jeans for sale on the site now. those definitely run smaller so these are true to size with a tight fit.
other Great summer shirt, loose and casual. it's pretty flowy and not form-fitted at all. i almost always wear a petite xs in retailer, and that is what i got (i'm 5'other and 12other pounds). fits great- loose and swingy, but is big (i like this). retailer, please get/restock petites for the pink color!
other Super cute blouse- great with a jean jacket, - sleeved or sleeveless. pleating is neat and a nice unique detail, without getting to full. usually a other or small in blouses, bought the xs. made this decision based on the arm hole openings, seemed a little large and set low on the small. .
other As a curvy, short gal, finding a nice button down that isn't boxy or way too low cut is like finding a gem. this shirt is perfect for work, and i love how flattering it is. my only reservation is that it is more sheer than i would like, and so i need a camisole with it. i wish this style came in more colors!
other So sad becuase i like the design. i would not recomend the lack to anyone that does not live and work and shop in a completely immaculate environment. i wore this to work the day after purchasing and within three hours i honestly looked like i had slept in this sweater for three monthe straight. i had to take the sweater off and work in a t-shirt. the marigold color may be better than the black abut showing lint but something intrinsic to the fabric really attracts lint like nothing i have eve
other Love this dress. the fit is amazing. i wore it to church for my brother's wedding and got so many compliments. it looks great in photos too!
other This piece is comfortable and easy to pair with leggings or denim. soft and not too heavy.
other Every so often the perfect pair of bottoms comes along. this style was it for me. i'm tall 5'9 so the length fits perfect for a crop wide leg trouser. i will be able to wear these in the summer as they are light weight enough and also into fall before it gets too cold. can't wait to wear them. extra bonus i got them on sale. if you are short these will probably be more like a long leg trouser on you. also fit true to size.
other Ok, so first things first. i'm 5'4", 125#, 4/27, 32g and i took a small in this. it's your typical cloth/stone fabric and feel sooo good!i do agree that this romper is on the shorter side but i liked that about it. it is far more flattering than the modeling photos online. it doesn't look that "oversized". i can see where taller ladies won't go for the shortness but at 5'4" that's just not an issue for me. the bottom is very flattering and doesn't do that "long grandma butt" that some rompers
other These pants fit great. the velvet material is a sleek look . these pants can be casual by day and are easily dressed up in the evening.
other I absolutely love this top, the design and the cut. it is very long in the back. it is very flattering. i would have given it other stars except it is see through. i wish it didn't need a cami. layering tops gets old fast in the hot weather.
other Yes it is thin but a great summer blouse. the body runs true to size, but the sleeves are tight..i may try to size up so the sleeves can be more comfortable.
other I love the print on these pants. they are beautifully flowy and flattering. the only downside is that they are see through so i'm going to take them to tailor to have a lining put in up to the knee so i can wear them to places other than the beach. i bought them on sale today in the store and bought a size small.
3 I typically wear a size xl in retailer clothes. i'm a size 16 in tops and this sweater in xl fit really baggy with no form fitting. it's super soft and i love the color, but it was just unflattering on me.
other I love the embroidery detailing on the top. i think this shirt looks better in person than online.i'm an hourglass shape, and this loose style for shirts often tents out away from my chest, but this top drapes down nicely. however, loose shirts like this aren't my style, so i belt this at my waist, and it looks even better. the top flatters my broad shoulders (meaning that it doesn't make them look wider), and it hits below my hips (i'm 5'10"). i also appreciate that the armholes are small,
other Comfy, but constantly picking pills off of it, from first wear.
other I am in lust with this fabulous dress. it's a feast for the eyes. it's so busy and detailed, yet it all works. fit on me is perfect. i did not have to size down or up. my upper torso is larger (m/l) than my bottom half (m/s). i also have a square waist. this dress makes me look like i have an hourglass figure. i love it as much as the mona dress. another point goes to ease of putting it on. i own six byron lars dresses and this is the *easiest* one to put on! just zip up and go.
other I love wearing this to bed and it's really pretty! the lace is thin and delicate, so it can get snagged easily, but it's pretty comfortable. the only thing that could make it more comfortable is if the material underneath the bust was looser, though it wouldn't be as supportive. overall, i think it's a very beautiful chemise!
3 This sweater looks soft and flowy on the model, but in the store it is rather stiff lace in the back and very plain in the front. i did not like the ribbing on the front bottom of the sweater because it pulled in places and didn't lie flat. way too expensive for what you are getting.
other I ordered the floral blue dress. i am a size 8-10 and ordered the medium. it did not find that it was large on top as others had mention. i love the smoking but would also look great with a belt and boots. it makes a great all weather dress.
other This top is perfect! i love the fit and the length and the weight of the fabric! it is thin without being sheer. i just wish there were other fun colors...
3 I really liked the look of this top online, but when it came i had a couple of issues with it. first, when i tried it on i found the underarms to be a little snug (i normally wear a 10/m, and that's what i ordered). it makes raising my arms tough, and as a teacher, i need to be able to lift my arms above my waist. secondly, my husband's first reaction was that it "looks like pajamas." the abstract floral/stripe gets a little lost.on the other hand, the color palette is very pretty and the qual
other The reviews i read scared me a little about this top being super cropped. it is on the short side, but will be adorable with shorts and pants that aren't low cut. the multi-textured fabric is gorgeous!
other I ordered two sizes up, after reading reviews and added a belt for waist definition. it is long...i am six feet tall and it is perfect for me. this is absolutely beautiful; my husband loves the floral print, and i received countless compliments after one wear. the light, flowing material swayed and billowed in the breeze of the outdoor wedding i attended. very feminine and enjoyable to wear. pricey, but i felt i could wear spring through autumn. love! <3
other The fabric wrinkles so easily and any slight moisture or liquid immediately turns into a dark spot on the blue grey...condensation drips from a glass, gel deodorant, etc. i tried the cream but it's very sheer. i had to return this dress-- not practical!
other Love this skirt. super comfortable, yet nicely tailored. roomy pockets always come in handy. the dark mustard looks great with the black and white tops that dominate my closet. this will be my go-to skirt for the fall for both my business-casual office environment and weekends out and about running errands, etc. i agree with the other reviewers re: sizing: because of the stretch, if you?re between sizes, you should size down. i'm usually a medium, or size 8 or 10, so i got the 8. i may have been
3 Unfortunately this piece has a very boxy cut and the white layer is stiff and billows out - i am tall and thin but this made me look pregnant - very unflattering. i considered trying a smaller size, but i did not like the material too much either so i just returned it.
other This dress is lovely . i am 5' 1, athletic and busty (38 d/dd) - but not super slim so not easy to petite items that fit in the chest/arms. i ordered pm which usually works and it was actually too big in the chest. im waiting on the ps but think it will work since the cut is generous. material/item is so lovely and comfortable!! i never have extra chest room, so this was such a great surprise!! hope the ps is great but think it will be unless they went crazy on making it to small.
other I bought this dress for the summer, but it will transition nicely into the fall with a sweater, leggings, and boots. the color and pattern are pretty and without being washed out. the macrame belt is absolutely beautiful. it doesn't show up well in the picture, but is intricate and artistic. seems sturdy as well. i can't wait to wear it out!
other This cute dress highlights some trouble spots and emphasizes good parts too, so i'm happy but not ecstatic.  for myself, the sleeves are tight and  so is the fit across the back and shoulders.  sizing up makes the voluminous skirt overwhelming.  the skirt is already a lot to handle in my regular size.  the good part is the pattern, swingy silhouette and it covers my tummy.  i have thick arms, wide bust, round back and meaty shoulders.  140# 5'3" 36d and purchased size 10.
other These jeans are exactly what i was looking for. love the rich olive color. these are definitely an olive green and not a brown color, which i was very happy about. fit is great, i am 5'7" 150 athletic hippy build and a size 29 fits great. they are the perfect ankle length jean. very soft, and just the right amount of stretch.
other These jeans are soooo soft. fit is great and the wash is a unique inky grayish color. perfect for fall. love.
other First let me say that i've recently fallen in love with the pilcro brand. i love the pilcro hyphen chinos and needed some new shorts for the summer. i have extremely muscular legs and have a hard time finding shorts that look good. i was hesitant to try these on because they said the inseam is 4" but one other reviewer pointed out that they are a good mid-length if you unroll them, so i just went to try them on at the store, and what do you know? they are exactly that! unrolled, they come about
other I fell in love with the color scheme and knew this would be perfect for vacations and weddings.  colors are slightly muted in reality, seems the retailer filter adds more contrast, but it's still gorgeous!   lining is full length, there's a zipper going up the back, fitted at the waist, and ribbon ties at the back of the neck that are long enough to style at the throat if wanted.  i wasn't sure of my size so i picked my larger range and i'm glad i did.  my weight fluctuates so when it goes down, t
other Just beautiful dress! it dits perfectly, tts and i feel like princess in it! highly recommend girls!
other I loved this skirt when i tried it on. the material is soft with a bit of stretch. i'd say this runs a little large. for reference, i'm usually a size 2/other in retailer and the other was still a little large towards the end of the day as it stretched out. however, my disappointment was with the buttons.i wore it for a day when all of a sudden the top button popped off. fine, that button is the most used. i sewed it back on myself and even reinforced the top three buttons that i use to take on and of
other Disappointed, the cut of the layer makes anyone wearing it look pregnant. even the model in the picture the way that layer hangs.
other I ordered a size 10 in the neutral motif and it fits perfectly and it looks great. i am 5'9" 145lbs with 38" bust. the sleeves are the perfect length. i couldn't be happier with this purchase.
other As the previous reviewer stated, this wrap is over sized but that is the style. the knit is soft and dense and the metallic accents are subtle and lovely. this is an heirloom piece that will last for many, many years.
other I had been looking for something like this to add to my summer wardrobe. fortunately for me i saw these in the retailer catalog and thought, how perfect, exactly what i've been searching for. they are a bit pricey, and crotch hangs a bit lower on me because i'm only 5'3, but it's not enough to make me send them back, i will have them altered if need be, they are to cute. i'm a size other in pants and ordered the 29, i wanted some wiggle room, i didn't realize the denim has stretch, i will keep the
other Okay, this is the cutest sleep jumper i've ever owned. it's soft and cozy, and even a tiny bit sexy. i give it other stars because it's a little on the thin side; not sheer but close. really fun little piece. definitely recommend.
other This sweatshirt is very cute on. it works well with leggings or skinny jeans. it's the perfect thing to wear when you want to be comfortable but still look feminine.
other I love the color and shimmer of this dress. it is very unique and one of a kind. the slit is not as high as the photo online but that can be adjusted if need be at a tailor. it's a great dress!
other Just bought this dress in a 6. i'm 5'7" 138 lbs (32b, 29 in jeans). this is *so* much better than pictured. it's an empire waist that really flatters my small bust and accentuates the thin part of the waist. i have an hourglass figure, but can see this working great for pear shapes. i wish the material felt softer, but the fit was so perfect, even for my broad shoulders. will transition nicely to warmer weather, but for now, i plan to wear it with leggings and a cardigan.
3 I want to love this dress. the colors and pattern are gorgeous, and i love the hemline. but something seems off in the chest and shoulders area. it almost feels a little slouch-y.
3 The color and detailing on this shirt are pretty, but it is incredibly wide at the hips. as someone with a large chest, it was very unflattering.
other This sweater is adorable and comfortable, but the poms are barely secured so they just pop off whenever they rub up against anything. i cannot even imagine trying to wash it. unfortunately, i will reluctantly be returning it because the construction is very poor.
other Very happy i purchased this jacket - although to me it is really a coat. it fits wonderfully and is so soft. i appreciate the uniqueness - not the usual dull winter shades of black/gray/navy. although i live in minneapolis much of the winter & it will not be warm enough once the temps drop beyond 20 degrees, it is perfect for the in-between 21- 50 degree days. i am a size 6 (5'5", 13other lbs). tried the small & medium. the s was a bit snug in the hips so chose the m and it is just right.
other The great thing about a swing dress is that it doesn't cling to the curves. this one is the same way. i got the geometric print. the colors are fun. i would have gone down to the small just to loose some of the material on this dress if it had not fit across so tight across the back. if you have no bust, i would say size down two sizes or try a petite. the dress has a breathable fabric so great for summer wear. the only cons are the large armpits and extra fabric but sizing down should help.
other Love this dress! fits tts. great fitted slip underneath beautiful lace design. i'm 5'6" the dress (size small), hits right above my knees. very versatile dress, may be dressed up or down depending on shoes
other I was hesitant to buy these jeans online because citizens are generally not very forgiving, being that they don't have much stretch.  they are always in the stack that i try on but haven't bought a pair of citizens in several years. these are totally different!  the have enough stretch to be sculpting without being uncomfortable while keeping the substantial feeling that comes with denim versus leggings.  i looooooove these jeans!!!
other The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality, and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit, immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.
other This is well made and beautiful, but it sometimes slides off so i feel like i'm adjusting it somewhat regularly.
other This shirt fits very closely to the body. it has a very strange fit in the shoulder, though. the arms themselves are really long, far past my hands, yet it's very tight in the shoulder and under arm area. for reference, i am 5'10", 130 pounds and ordered a small, which is what i usually need.
other I purchased this for a late summer wedding that i was invited to last minute and i can't wait to wear it! i got it on sale with an additional percentage off and for the price it is a steal. like all of tracy reese designs it is so cute and feminine. it runs just a tad bit on the larger side so the medium fit my size 10 figure perfectly (i tried on the large and it was too big and too long for me). the medium length was perfect for my height (5"6).
other I bought this top during the extra 30% off sale, so the price was definitely worth it and i know i'll get a lot of wear out it. i bought the grey and the lace isn't too revealing, but just enough for me to want to wear a cami underneath, especially at work. i'm normally a small/other in retailer brands, but i bought a xs and it fits great, so it does run a little large.
other I loved this top so much i bought it in both colors. size down because it run very large, but it is nice and flowy. i'm 5'11" and slim and the top hung nicely on me.
other This skirt is a really beautiful print and made of a lovely silky fabric. i didn't have the "see-through" issue that the other reviewer mentioned, my main concerns were the length (i'm 5'other and it almost goes to my ankles) and that it poofs out a little right below the waist band. i'm between a small and a medium and went with the small. it fits but i wonder if it would lie flatter and be more flattering if i had gone with a medium instead.
other The back of this top is very unique and the embroidery looked like it would hold up.it does have a boxy shape, but it really works with this piece. i found it to run true to size compared to other pieces i have from retailer. for some reference, i'm 5'5" and weigh 148lbs.
other I was excited to see this top, ordered it and was disappointed. it was too tight across the chest and had too much fabric around the bottom. i tried this on 3 times hoping for i had been wrong in previous assessments- no luck.
other This is a beautiful coat. no one has mentioned how beautifully the pattern matches, even across the arms coordinating with the front. i love the lower button as it allows for arm movement and contributes to the casual slouch. the only complaint i have is there is a slight dark spot above both pockets. this appears to be a sewer's mark for placement. i think i have figured out how to disguise it without marring the fabric; but second item from retailer with marks (quality control?). i am keeping th
other Huge bummer. this top is definitely a crop/midi-top. plus, it's cream, not white like shown in the photos. i'm returning it today.
other Beautiful and delicate!!
other I generally don't write bad reviews, but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost. the design and colors are great, but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturer's tag is at the back of the neck. the material is very thin, so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment. i shop at retailer all the time, and this is not a $98 item of clothing.
other The perfect tee. this is exactly what i have been looking for. flattering fit,looks great dressed up or down and has just a touch of unique detail without being over the top, the top is just slightly thin but can definitely be worn without a cami underneath. this reminds me of old retailer tops from several years ago that i just loved and wore to death.
other I ordered this in a petite (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips, and size 4p fits perfectly) and it fits very well everywhere. however, i think if you're bigger than 34b, size up, because this top is very fitted around the bust. the bottom hem falls right below my belly button, the neckline is not too low and not too high. i chose black because i feel that there are a lot of details and can be toned down with a darker color. i think this top must be fitted for a tailored look, or otherwise one may risk t
other Loved this tee but embroidery started to unravel even before being washed. i paid full price for this top and wasn't disappointed but needed to return due to the embroidery problem. this tee is a mustard color.
other Looks great on. fits beautifully,
other I so wanted to buy this top - especially during the 30% off tops sale this past weekend - so it would have been just about $100.  but while it was well made, i could see it easily snagging or getting caught on jewelry.    if it was on sale even more, i might have considered it.  it could be extremely versatile, with jeans, black skinny pants or leggings.  really loved it, but couldn't see spending that much money on it.
other The skirt material is super comfortable. hte cut is also pretty flattering, i don't hink this picture does the skirt justice. the regualr size was a little long on me, i would order a petite (if like me, you are 5'1.5"#, went xs #at 11other lbs). the skirt is also a bit stretchy, not stiff.color is way prettier in person, i never looked twice at th skirt online, but in the store, it looked myuch prettier.
other Love! received so many compliments! it can be dressed up or down and is so comfortable.  i did order a l  based on the reviews, but found it to be big.  i would've returned for a m, but it was sold out and i didn't want to risk not having it at all so i kept.
other These are so comfortable, it's like wearing jammies outside. i love the pattern and you really can't be the comfort.
other I love this so so much. i'm 5'1" with a short torso and post baby 34d boobs. the 6 petite is perfect. it's the first romper i found that fits me in the crotch, height, and leg area. so excited to wear this!
other Overall very pretty.
other This is a great sweater that i know i'll get a ton of use out of! i've already worn it three times, and i've had it a week. i typically wear small or medium in tops and sweaters, and ordered a medium in this one to ensure the arms were comfortable. the nude color is perfect.
other I love wearing a dress at thanksgiving but don't want to be too dressy. this was perfect;: casual with a bit of sass and comfortable. it's also arm enough and super cute with booties. i'm 5'4" and small boned. the xs fit perfect.
other For me, this skirt runs a little large. my waist is smaller than my hips so i was able to order a small, which fits perfectly. i'm 5'5" and the length hits at the right spot, too, so there is no need for hemming. i have yet to wear the skirt, but i anticipate that it will be a great piece to transition from summer to fall with an easy switch of the shirt and shoes. can't wait to get a lot of use out of this one!
other I wore this dress for this first time today, and it is a head-turner. sure to be a new favorite! i received several compliments while out running errands. the dress is flattering to my hourglass shape (i tied it in the back). it is not at all clingy; it flows nicely. the top of the dress is bra-friendly and not too low cut. i am 5'8" and found the length to be just right for me; the medium skims the tops of my feet, and i wore the dress with flat sandals. unlike another reviewer, the dress i rec
other This is going to be my go-to winter sweater for work! this piece is super comfy, yet a bit more dressy than just a regular sweatshirt. it will be an especially great layer for the ups and downs of the office thermostat.
other Did not even know this is available in petite! as someone who is at 5' exaggerated, there regular size xs/s fits nicely. great find. goes well with leggings or jeans. this will be a wardrobe staple for quite a while.
other I like that the top is lightweight and very comfortable and is flattering. i can see wearing this over the holidays for entertaining. it looks festive and pretty - something easy to pop on and look pulled together in a flash.
other I love this shirt. the colors are just as depicted. the material is gorgeous and the top is very flattering. fits true to size for retailer small (i'm normally a medium outside of this store).
other This cropped trouser is very high quality and perfect for summer. i ordered my usual size petite other (i am 5'2" 11other lb) and i felt a little tight but since other previous reviews said they do stretch after wearing it, i decided to keep it. i hope they stretch out a little bit more. overall, i am very happy with my purchase.
other These look great on my wife. very versatile and go with like 80% of her wardrobe. she raves about them and they look great.
other Bought this shirt in red in my usual size small. it is so comfortable and easy to wear. i am 5' 8.5" tall and it fall on me similar to the model in the picture. not sure if i can wear with leggings--may be too short in front. i'm looking forward to layering it under sweaters and sweater vests for a pop of color.
other I just got this skirt in the mail, and i'm absolutely delighted with it. i'd ordered both my normal size and one size up, taking a tip from the reviewer who'd found it snug, but my usual retailer size fit beautifully. (i do have narrow hips, though, so maybe it's snug on more curvaceous figures?) the fabric is so soft and supple. and i've already tried the skirt with several widely varying shoe styles, so i can confirm its versatility: it looks feminine with heeled sandals (as in the pictur
other I have looked at this dress a dozen times online and passed. after reading other reviews felt compelled to see why everyone is in love with this dress. when i opened the box i was blown away. this dress is so beautiful and the crystals, which look like sequence online are high quality, as is the fabric and craftsmanship.a perfect 10!!!!!!!!!!!!you must have this dress in your closet!!!!!!!ordered my usual size and fits perfect.
other I ordered one size down and it's still plenty roomy. as others have said, the sleeves are a tighter fit, but there is a tiny bit of stretch to the fabric. i'm smaller busted and didn't want the v-neck to get too low, so i sized down one. very cute tucked into jeans or paired with leggings.
other I just ordered this top and so far really like it, it is pretty and feminine and comfortable. the one thing i would note is that the lace running down the center has holes which you can see through, unlike the lace to each side. it's not extremely noticeable, but i am planning on wearing a cami under it. i ordered a small and it fits pretty well but is definitely on the looser side, i wonder if possibly the extra small would work for me, but i'm fairly tall so i went with the small.
other These jeans are adorable!  i wear a 10p and the 30 petite fit perfectly. great quality and will look cute with a boxy crop top and flats.
other This sweater is really lovely. it doesn't look like it does in the picture. i got the xsmall as i was worried it would run big. it's much shorter than i though, fits more like a petite size. the sleeves are 3/other length, which i wasn't thrill with but accepted. the color combo is really lovely! it's very comfortable and well made and it was perfect for work but lovely with a pair of jeans too!
other This vest kept catching my eye online. i was ordering moth cashmere cowlneck sweater, (which is fabulous,) when i noticed pictures posted of women wearing both the vest & sweater. the more i looked at these pictures, the more i fell in love with the vest. needless to say, i purchased the vest in my usual size xs which fits tts. it's incredibly soft & a great piece to add to your wardrobe!
other But i stil ldecided to pass. i would need the petite as it seemd long. also, there are other items i loved more, but if you need a cozy sweater that is different, this might be the one for you. the contrasting detaisl on the sleeves/collar are very nice.
other The holding horses brand never ceases to amaze me. this dress is gorgeous in person! i have received so many compliments while wearing this dress. the lace is intracately crafted and the lilac color is perfect. i actually have this magnolia dress in black as well and i might even get the new reddish color too. needless to say i'm obsessed with this dress?
other I purchased a size small. i usually always buy a petite. but this fit me just fine since it is a vest. the length in the back didn't fall too long. it runs true to size. it's soft and i wear it with long dresses, rompers, short dresses, skirts. it's a nice tapered vest. i'm 34d and it's fine.
3 Although i am small (size xs on top, 27 waist) this dress is not flattering if have any fat on your body....i would not recommend it.
other The attention to detail in aligning the pattern is excellent as always with this brand..i tried a size other and it fit fine, just above my long waist ( 5'2", currently 33-25-37.other with narrow hips and fuller thighs). i have several other cartonnier shorts in sizes 0 and 2, depending on my weight, and these fit similarly. i think the size other petite would be a bit lower but it's sold out now..the only reason i passed was that the fabric has a polyester fusible interfacing so that it keeps its s
3 Didn't love it, didn't hate, rather indifferent. the grey was a little more muted than i wanted for a summer tee.i'm 5'4", 123lbs, 34a, the xs fit if it wouldn't shrink, if you're about this size but larger busted go with the s.
other First, i did not notice the description mentioning metallic thread. i was disappointed when i opened the box to find it is a metallic, but actually i'm glad i didn't know because i love it. it does not look cheap and it really works. the pale peachy color is gorgeous and the metallic is subtle enough. the real issue for me is the size. i ordered the small and it is huge. enormous. especially from the back. the seam on the sleeve is just above my elbow so it's almost a bat wing kind of thing and
other I wanted a nice, well-fitting top that would work with trousers, jeans, and skirts alike, and be a nice wardrobe staple. i got two of these tops - one size s (black) and one m (turquoise). the size m is gigantic and i have to return it. the size s is also a whole lotta shirt. the top is really long and has a multi-level bottom, as well as the pocket, making it not just a simple top but a rather "loud" top. nevertheless, i'm keeping the size s (black) as a versatile shirt that i can hopefully tuc
other The are so comfortable, flattering, and i feel i can wear them with a lot of styles: dress them up or down, it all looks good. great product! make more like this please!
other I tried this on in the store, but almost didn't because i thought it would look like a sack. the dress looks so good. it fits nicely in the shoulders which gives structure and then the rest of the dress is roomy, but no so much it looks stupid. im 5'5" and it hit above my knees by an inch or two.
other This is my new favorite dress! i can't tell you how flattering it is. i just had a baby a few months ago, and it's the only piece of clothing i actually feel like i look like my old, pre-baby self in! i'm on the shorter side (5'3"#, very busty #because i'm nursing# and about 118 lbs. i got a mp and it fits great. i could have gotten the small, but i feel that would have been too low cut. honestly, love the cut, the pattern, everything about it. would buy again!
other I own a couple of bailey 4other dresses and am a huge fan of their comfort and ability to flatter my figure. when i saw this one on a special promo, i knew i had to try it on. once i did, i knew it had to come home with me. i wore it to a work event last night and look forward to wearing it on a date night soon. i am a s or m and took a s in this dress. i went with cobalt and paired it with gold jewelry as in the photo.
other I purchased this tee last week in white and love it! as soon as i saw that it was on sale i ran to get a price adjustment and to pick up a few more colors! i had every intention to grab up the blue today however i tried on four larges and all were cut way shorter than the other colors. i ended up purchasing the red which fits exactly as my white one does. perfect light weight, easy, but adorable tee for summer!
other This shirt is really cute.  i love the color and design.  i like wearing it with jeans and sneakers.
other I'm a size other in retailer pretty much across the board - size 26/27 bottom, other top, generally go for the xs. and i ordered this in a other based on other reviews. it's definitely not a winter coat, which i understood. it's not for layering over a heavy sweater either. i wish i had ordered the size other instead so that it was a little snugger in the waist. as is i can wear it over a shirt, dress, or light sweater, and that's fine, but unlike other reviewers i don't think you need to size up if you want the
other Like previous reviewers have said, these run a bit small and i'm surprised no one's mentioned that these are very high rise. for reference, i'm 5'7", 130 lbs, 34-27-37, and am an retailer size other in tops and pants. i really wanted to love these pants, but even after ordering a size up and trying on a 6, i was still not in love. and the other reviewers are right ? the back zipper is kinda hard to zip up. the top of these pants are exactly the same as the essential flares, so if you're thinking of ge
3 I absolutely loved the idea of an elongated hoodie as a lounge dress or robe. unfortunately, this particular product left a lot to be desired. firstly, the fit is slim, not relaxed. i'm 5'4", at 110 lbs and tried both the size other (equivalent of a small) and size other (equivalent of a medium). sizing up just added length and did not do much to increase roominess. they both zipped up easily but did not drape well. finally, the fabric was really not welcoming. i prefer terry over fleece, however this w
other This top fits a bit trimmer than the summer version of this top did. the lavender color is muted and a nice fall transition color.
other I don't know how this dress doesn't have more of a following! it's really perfect. i will say, i am tall (5'8") and lanky. the dress is oversized, but not overly so, drapes beautifully, and will work for any season. fabric is divine. i plan to wear this to work, for travel, on weekends, etc. love the cream/deep charcoal color. at the sale price, this really is a great, versatile find.
other Purchased these in the blue motif. love the hei hei silky pull on pants. i got hooked on them last summer and was thrilled to see them for the upcoming spring. they run true to size. they are beyond comfortable and wear well. everyone should have at least one pair of these comfy pants in their closet. dress them up, down or wear them to the office. versatility and comfort, what more could you ask for.
3 I recommen only becuase i like it on other people, but not on me. the pull on style didn't work, i need xs petite to fit lenght and waist, but the waist wasn't elastic enough to "pull up" (i have let's say a booty#. i kept hearing hte stiching give... it also looked a little too poooofffy on my frmae, i am 5'1.5" and it stuck more out than on the model. nice idea, btu not for me. #i am 11other lbs#
other Love this easy caftan short dress so soft easy and so stylish
other This dress is beautiful! it is a nice, heavy fabric with stretch and just fits perfectly.
other This was a disappointment because beautiful fabrics with interesting design are a rarity--and especially at this length! unfortunately, this is a mess in terms of proportions. if a size other can barely get it off, then there is a design flaw. sadly, the fit was so strange that it did not seem that simply sizing up would correct the flaws.
other I was looking for a comfortable top that looks put-together and cute for work, and this one fits the bill. i couldn't decide between black or white ? so i got both! if i had to choose, i would stick with the black, because it's more slimming, particularly for those of us with a large bust. it's not as heavy or stiff of a material as it appears in the pic, which i like, but it still has structure. great basic with some flair. i got the small (my normal retailer size), and it fit perfectly.
other I love everything about this tee. it has wonderful detailing that makes it different from other tees. the fabric is soft, and the tee is very comfortable. i disagree with some of the other reviews about the colors. i actually love both colors. the red is a nice slightly brownish red. i wore that color with a pair of plaid (white, teal, & taupe) shorts, and i got compliments on my outfit. the color will go with more than one might think. i haven't worn the green one yet. i hope this tee comes bac
other Extremely cute sweater, but after having worn it twice it's already pilling up. i'd expect more for a $100 sweater.
other These jeans are fantastic! i've worn them once and got many compliments. definitely keepers. i am 5'8" and weigh about 135. normally i wear a 29 but i sized down based on reviews to a 28. they fit perfectly at the start of the day, but as all jeans with a bit of stretch do, they get bigger as the day goes on, but because they're a boyfriend cut it all works. really happy with this purchase. my only regret is that i didn't get two pair.
other This dress looks way better than pictured online. it is lyocel i think so it has a little bit of weight (not heavy and bulky like denim but not as thin as some chambray items i've purchased before) and lays great! i purchased a size small, i am 5'8'' 128lbs and thought it was true to size, i can't wait to wear this! warm weather, sandals and a tote for running errands!
other Just received my second pair of pilcro in the red. i loved the color and needed a back up pair. perfect fabric for year round wear. length is great for my height. love every pair i own. this is my 12th pair. love love them.
other Nice quality fabric that's soft to the touch, lightweight, and lays smoothly. runs small - great for those of us who are small on top! the s fits like xs. longer length but not tunic length. the navy can pass for dark silver-gray.
other I honestly liked this little cardigan. it is a misnomer as a jacket. it really is more of a light sweater/cardigan, but i didn't have any negative issues like others on here.________pros:- great feel on the skin and fabric. this really caught my attention. hard to find a sweater that's breathable for cool summer evenings or mornings.- color scheme will go with anything, elegant touch.- unlined making it breathable.- runs large, forgiving it. stretchy. i'm normally a size 10/1other (m/l)
other This dress is so light and twirly and the fabric is as airy as it is pretty. sadly the fit was a bit off. i am 5'7", 128. i tried on my usual sz other and found the top to be saggy at the armpits but too tight at the waist seam; going up to a other only made for a saggier top. most likely a great dress for lean or long-torsoed ladies, which sadly i'm not!
other This maxi is perfect! the neckline is sexy but not too sexy (yay for normal bra!), and the waistline is flattering. the skirt isn't very full, but the ruffle effect at the bottom gives it nice movement. it could easily be dressed up or dressed down. i can't imagine that this wouldn't be flattering on anyone. it fit totally true to size for me.
other The stitched pattern on this shirt is so pretty! it fits loosely and looks good with a slimmer bottom. it is a little bit itchy but i didn't feel i needed to wear something underneath.
other The shirt fits very nicely, a little large but very confortable. amazing color (i got it in green)
other I followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down from a s to xs. i was worried about the length of the torso since i'm long in that area, but the xs still worked great. it's a totally adorable jumpsuit with a nice fit. my biggest peeve with this was that it came dirty on the hems...like it had been dragged on the ground somewhere. unfortunately, there were no more xs online once i got it though, so i will keep and try to clean. this is not the first time in recent months that i have recei
other I purchased this vest in the store. the colors vary depending on where it is sewn - i purchased one with black around the middle, and more black around the collar (it was more flattering). the fit and design are lovely. it's fuzzy, but since i don't have any 'fur' in my wardrobe, this is a nice ease into that part of fashion for me. i highly recommend it, even for the price.
other I don't usually write reviews, but i loved this dress in the store and would have passed it right over online. the skirt is a charcoal color and the top is an antique white. it gives the appearance of a separate crop top. i would usually wear a small (5'2" and 12other lbs.). i'm wearing a small in the photo, but ended up going back for an xs. the dress could go more casual with flats or boots and a scarf, or dressier with heels and jewelry. i think i'll get a lot of use out of it.
3 Cute design. runs big in neckline, falls off shoulder exposing bra straps. fabric is very thin. sloppy look on short petite frame. 5'1" 142lbs 34-36 c/d. purchased a medium. haven't washed it yet, but the fabric doesn't look like it will hold up well. i have kept it to wear as a sleep shirt with thin gray sleep sweats.
other This dress fitted me like a glove. i ordered the size 4, at 5ft7 and 130lbs, it was perfect though i could not weigh two pounds more. i cannot wait to wear it, it has that wow thing going for it, very good quality too.
other This sweater is really cute, and comfortable - but the color is a tad off from the picture. it's a deeper blue than i was expecting, and the pocket is not a "rust" color as depicted online. it's definitely closer to red. other than that, i still do like it - the speckles are a nice touch, and it is true to size, and not too short.
other This is the little black dress i've been looking for for years -- great slim fit (runs small -- i usually get sized out but the 00 was a snug fit), eye-catching design. like the other reviewer, i think solid black panels rather than floral brocade would have been classier, but overall a chic dress.
3 I bought this because i thought it would flatter my boxy big busted shape and it does. however, while i liked the irregular hemline on the model, on my 5'other frame it hits at a strange place and so i will hem it a little shorter. the fabric is extremely thin and not lined so this is definitely a light weight summer top even here in the south. i love the modern styling but the quality of the fabric is a concern, definitely no dryer on this one.
other I love paige jeans and these are no exception. the wash is so so great - a faded black/charcoal grey. it's like having two pairs of jeans in one! i am normally a 26 in most jeans and that's what i took in these. highly recommend!
other Love the cute print and texture of fabric. perfect casual t-shirt.
other Not sure i'm keeping this. i love it but it's short in the waist (i'm 5'7") and very tight in the top. i'm on the small side of a size 8 normally. a 6 sometimes, but the 8 in this is very tight. i do have broad shoulders but am thin at 126 pounds. so not sure if it's just me or if the dress is truly smallish. it is lovely and i want to keep it. will try it on again tomorrow and decide. if you are on the large end of any size, do size up.
other I really liked the style of this dress. the top was nice and stretchy and the bottom is so soft and silky. i love lace and thought that was a nice detail for the top. the colors are a little brighter in person, the red in the pictures here is more of a hot pink in person. i'm planning on buying some hot pink flats to wear with it at a wedding this summer! one reviewer said she didn't like the placement where the dress fell, i have a short torso and long legs, so i like to try to emphasize a
other This is a darling white top. the juxtaposition of the simple front and the beautiful lace back makes this a unique piece. definitely size down.
other Got this in the pretty springy blue already wore it with white jeans and loved it!! love the loose longer swingy style and i can't wait to wear again! i may have to get another color!
other I ordered the correct size due to reading other reviews who gave their height , weight, and chest size. thank you all for that! i am other feet other 3/other inches tall and fluctuate between 13other lbs and 139 lbs. i wear 36b in bras. i ordered an 8. fits great! the coverage is adequate on my backside. the rouching is very nice in the mid section for self conscious women like me. the color is fun and beautiful. the quality is excellent! i love the bra support! there are real bra cups sewn in! it was pricey bu
other This dress is adorable, but fit a bit large through the waist. i ordered the 6 and am exchanging for the 4, so hopefully it will work better for me. for reference, i am 5'7, 13other lbs curvy. the fabric is soft and swingy and the striped under-layer is feminine and adorable. love.
other I love this dress! the fabric feels amazing & is super flattering. i am 5'other with broad shoulders & a 36d chest and went with the small petite. i originally purchased the regular extra small which looked great, i just think the sp was slightly neater though the shoulders & length. it hits me above the knee as shown in the photo of the light colored dress with the long vest
other I love it. perfect, body hugging, just right length and great fabric colors. this shift fits just above knee and follows every curve. it is, however, unforgiving-there is no room in this to cover bumps or bulges; it is sleek and so figure-flattering. i am 140 lbs, 5'other tall and 34d and it fits perfectly. one more pound and it wouldn't have zipped! i got a size 6 (my usual)!but too tight had to size up to 8. if you are on the fence, go up a size. i can't, however, imagine wearing this sleeveless a
other Beautiful dress. the details are lovely. it feels a little bit like a nightgown. i always wear a slip. bust does run a little small so i unbutton the first few buttons. armholes feel a little small also.
other I found this dress delightful! i have worn it numerous times and though quite long (for some girls) fits me well. my only complaint is that if the wind blows it tends to fly open as there is only on clasp at the breast. the fabric is light and comfortable, i wore it in costa rica and it felt refreshing. i am 5'9", 15other lbs and a 34a cup; i would suggest a larger size for girls as the small fit me very well.
other Cute shirt, nice for layering.
other Soft, pretty design and perfect length. i'm 5'6" and the m fit perfectly!'
other I ordered this skirt in a size small and when i received it, not only was it too long, but there was also a hole in it. so i returned it. when a small petite became available, i ordered it thinking it would fit better. i just received it and there is a hole in this skirt as well. both skirts also looked as if they had been worn; there was fuzz and lint all over the skirts. i like the skirt but i either have extremely bad luck or it's really bad quality.
other This dress is even better in person! i am usually a size other and i went up to a 4. it is my favorite dress this spring! it is so cute with booties or sandals. i would say that it runs slightly small, so you should get the next size up if you're busty or have hips. it has been selling fast, you should get it while you can! :)
other I found this dress on sale recently in store and it was in my size- a 2p! i tried it on and it fits perfectly for my 3other d and 5ft frame. since i found it in store and it is an older dress, there are some frays in the threading (probably from being shipped, handled, etc). i still bought it for the sale price. i look forward to wearing it out!
other These are the perfect tights-fit and feel are top quality and they wash well!
other Great dress.  fitted but flowing.  i like the colors and think it will easily grams iron to fall.  i am other ft 3other d 27 waist.
other This looks just as good in person as it does online.   true to size.  definitely warm, but not too heavy.  comfortable as well.
3 I agree with the other reviews that these jeans run big. for my body, straight up and down, i ordered other sizes down, but would have ordered one size down had i been able to try them on in the store. the jeans i received were lighter, not blue, and more grey with very noticeable white whiskering. i need a new pair of jearns and i love the cut of these so i am keeping this pair, but, for me, because of the color they are just ok compared to the wow i was expecting from the picture.
other I ordered this shirt, aware of what the other reviewers said about it being tight in the chest. it's true- it's a bit restrictive if you need full-range of motion for your shoulder blades, but if you're not planning on doing any heavy-lifting or sporting events in this top, it's just fine (disclaimer- i am small-chested). i will stick by my tts, though, because it was the right fit, despite being restrictive. i was worried the top was going to be a 'hard' jean, but it wasn't. it was nice and sof
other I purchased this jacket in green, x-small a while back and wasn?t 100% sure about it due to the size. i?m 5?3?, 117 lbs and a 33a and thought it was a little snug so i tried on the small and that was way too big so i kept the xs. i have worn it a few times and it does look great however i can only wear thin tops with it. recently i purchased the black, x-small and this i love. it?s looser then the green so i can get away with thicker tops. i do recommend both jackets. they are pricey for what
other If you have any curves, avoid! it is not flattering.the striped side panels look odd with the flow of the dress.
other I am a huge fan of ag stevie ankles and own at least a dozen pair. i am 5'4", so this style is perfect for me. this particular wash is a fantastic and flattering fit. it hits right above my ankle and fits beautifully through the hips and legs. i am going to buy a 2nd pair as i know i will be wearing these all the time!
other I love both the color of this sweater as well as the buttons on the cuffs. this sweater is an easy pick any day of the week and goes well with all of my work pants. plus, the soft and pretty pink adds some brightness to my otherwise dark winter wardrobe.
other When i first saw the bees embroidered pullover in the store, it instantly caught my attention. since it was pricey, i didn't get it. when it went on sale, it ran out in my size. so recently i was fortunate enough to get the same style embroidered birds pullover in the store for 20% off the sale price. this shirt looks so adorable on and is different than the typical sweatshirt.
3 Unfortunately, this is a lot more boxy in person than it shows on the model. it hung on me like a potato sack. also, the color isn't the rich red it shows but more of an orangey rust.
other Love this sweater! it is very simple but pretty! it has a very flattering fit and is comfortable.
other The tshirt is comfy and has a little curve on the tail which is fun!
other Just as pictured, this little top is just too cute! the fit is exceptional, and quite flattering. another very feminine top, and the yellow color is perfect! i love pairing yellow with black, of course...but also with reds, blues...and it looks great with white 'pedal pushers'!!! i think they call them 'cropped' now a days! at any rate...this is a first rate top that i highly recommend!
other Hi,like the other reviewers, i expected the price to be much higher. it is so warm, yet so flattering and cute. this will sell out, so buy now if you want it.
other I just couldn't resist the western scene and it doesn't disappoint. i ordered size large and although it's a bit long for me, it flows nicely over my hips. i had to try it on with several different bottoms and find it looks great with shorts and skinny or boyfriend jeans. just darling under a jean jacket and cardigan too. the fabric isn't thin or heavy. wasn't it goldilicks who said: it's just right! i love the uniqueness of the print that is just edgy and different enough to translate to great,
other I really like these. they're not too distressed, and the frayed ankle looks great. not too casual that you couldn't wear them to the office. the length is perfect on me, (i'm 5'1) i can wear them with sandals and booties without having to roll them up. they do run about one size small. i'm 5'1, 120 lbs, a slightly curvey petite and the 27 fit best,.
other This skirt is perfect. i'm a size 10 and i'm 48 years old. i've really been wanting a tulle skirt, but didn't want to look like baby huey in it a bip puffy tutu above my knees. this skirt is indicative of the quality that is bailley 44. the fit is great, the length is perfect. i plan to wear it with a chambray shirt and the burgundy colored obi belt.
other Fun blouse for spring with enough details to make it unique and dressy. very comfortable fit. banded bottom which is loose enough to still be comfortable. dresses up a pair of jeans quite nicely!
other I'm stunned by the bad reviews by others. i love this dress! it is an amazing, feminine, detailed, exceptional work of art, and lucky for me -- who usually takes 14s and 16s -- that it runs big. there is stretch to it, and it fits great! lucky, lucky me.
other I saw this skirt online and immediately went to the store to hunt it down.  is perfect!  one of the most beautiful items of clothing i own.  was worried the waistband would be unflattering since i'm short and curvy but it's very flattering.  can dress up or wear to the beach.  i love it!!
other This blouse is romantic and timeless. the tonal print is lovely, the peplum cut flattering. i followed the advice of other reviewers and ordered one size up, which fits perfectly. it has a hidden side zip to make for easier off and on. i love the mix of cotton and silk which makes it breathable and lightweight. thank you, retailer, for finally making a blouse with natural fabrics that do not need a cami underneath! perfect for warm climates.
other Bought this based off the reviews here but this was a miss for me. the colors weren't as vibrant as pictured and the waist in this dress is huge. not flattering and it went back. i buy an retailer dress every week so i just exchanged this one for another one i loved. not hard to do at all
other I have always been partial to palazzo pants. these fit like a dream and are very comfortable.
3 I saw this jacket and loved the plaid and the idea of a soft sherpa material as a lining was hard to pass up1it was true to size and the material was very nice. however, the button closure was difficult as the buttonholes seemed a bit too small. also, the back of the jacket did not lay flat and it kept rolling.... i had to return this jacket.
other These pants look nice and they are comfortable too! the relaxed fit isn't sloppy, and the colors are great.
other These pants are flattering yet comfortable. i am thrilled that they are available in tall sizes because i am 6 feet tall. the 36 inch inseam is perfect and for me prevents the problem of "high water" pants. the zippered pockets are flattering yet useful. the high rise waist is wonderful. these pants are perfect for wear in a number of occasions. they are great.
other The dress was just too ill fitting and bulky and large. it was more matronly looking then anything and did not fit well. if you are going to try it, probably size down other sizes. for reference, i'm 5'4" and 12other lbs. i bought my normal size other and it was very large. i would not recommend as it's just not flattering. i love one shoulder dresses and tops so was very disappointed as i'm an retailer devotee....
other I love this dress. i'd get it in both colors if i could! the cut and fit is beautiful, i'd suggest sizing down if you feel like it's too boxy or lacks shape. the bottom skirt is round enough to where you can twirl ( #other thing to look for in a dress ;) ) and it's just overall a classic pretty dress. my only complaint is that the overlay cut out seems a little bit delicate and i'm afraid it will be ruined after a few wears but it seems to be holding up fine so far and isn't incredibly delicate like
other It's a lovely and unexpected sweater. a few things to keep in mind- - the knit details are beautiful- the pictures don't do it justice.- it's pretty lightweight.- the color is a little darker than the picture shown- it's a very dark plum- it runs bigger- this is the only retailer sweater where the sleeves of a m are a little to long. - the style is decidedly casual and "slouchy". it looks great with jeans, but don't plan to dress up an outfit with this piece.
3 I had high hopes for this top, as it looked great online. unfortunately it was much more ruffly in person and not my style at all. it was a lot of fabric and poofed out too much -- reminded me of a child's top. sad to return it!
other I love cute summer dresses and this one, especially because it is made out of linen, is unique. it is very well-made with a design that is quite flattering. i am other foot 6 and a little curvy with a 38 c bust and i got a size 10. it fits well although it is difficult to zip up because the material has no give. the perfect dress to wear to italy or france! now i just have to book my tickets!
other The neck is so big on this sweater, i couldn't make it lay right. the shape of the sweater is odd. it is really wide on the upper torso, but tapers near your waist. it did not look as depicted on the model. the sweater is a lovely color, i liked the two-tone, but overall the fit was too weird for me. material is soft and it felt really nice on, but just too oddly shaped and a crazy big neck.
other So this skirt is everything. the only downside is that it's not in a petite sizing so i'm going to have to get this altered (i'm 5'3). the sizing is appropriate (usually wear an 8 or 10 in pants and got a size medium for the skirt), the material is thick enough for spring or summer weather, the color is just right (not too light), the pockets are adorable and i feel like i'm channeling some 70's realness, sits higher on your waist, and is super comfortable. i know i'm going to get a lot of use o
other I really like this jacket. very comfortable, nice material. i like the weight of this jacket, i wore it alone but it will be cute with a t-shirt under it too.
3 I was very excited when this dress arrived in the mail. the fabric is so comfortable, but the print was overwhelming. it is also very tight on the top and i got lost in the fabric at the bottom. i had to return it.
other Very comfortable shirt.  washes up nicely with just a little ironing on the pleats.  cute detail of colored thread on buttons.  just a tad tight in the shoulders but not distracting.  no button placket chest gapping.
other I love this skirt. it fits perfectly. great to transition from work to after-work event. very comfy. got lots of complements.
other I decided to order both the black & sand colors in the m/l. very soft & fit is perfect. has adjustable straps. wore under my racerback tank today for my usual walk. the bra & straps were not exposed. it did not rub or irritate at all. it will work well under other tops i have & some dresses that are racerback style. i have other racerback bras but they just haven't worked out - either too uncomfortable or the straps show anyways. this one is perfect! it's soft & lightweight. it has some moderate
other The color is a nice cool red and the material is very soft. but the dress left me feeling shapeless and the bell sleeve overtook it. i wanted to love it, but it just wasn't working for me. i'm 5'8" and purchased a s. it fits true to size, however it was loose around the waist and just wasn't complimentary on me. this will have to go back.
3 The blue has three colors of stripes: blue, white and black 9between white and blue). the black stripe made it too busy for me. the material is soft and clingy. i followed the advice of previous reviewer and sized up to a m (normally wear s). the shirt fit as pictured on the model, not tight but form fitting.
other I bought this dress for a wedding but decided it wasn't dressy enough and ended up exchanging it even though i really wanted to keep it? i ordered a xs and it fit like a glove, the gathering makes for a forgiving and flattering look and the color is absolutely gorgeous! very classy length for such a form fitting dress, too. i probably would have cut down the neck if i ended up keeping it bc high/tight turtlenecks aren't my thing which is reason for only other stars.
other The retailer by me actually had this and i had to try it on. my thoughts below:___________pros:- well-constructed with lining underneath to avoid the need of a cami or tank. no see-through issues whatsoever.- the fabric is great quality and looks nicely sewn. no fraying or strays seen on the other sizes i tried.- there's a back zipper that goes from top to bottom at the back. unusual as i don't see why that's needed since you can just slip it over your head.- front "v slit" isn't too low or reve
other I really like this top. it's super cute - perfect for a football game or fairly casual event. the material is ribbed and is thick enough that you can't see through. i purchased this top in red and initially in petite but ended up returning it for the regular size. i love this top!
3 Saw online and had to have. got it home and i was swimming in it! i normally am a size l in most retailer brands, but this felt so large! the actual top is lovely, with an airy artistic quality to it. not sure if i will go back for the medium or not.
other Bought this in store yesterday, light fit and extremely comfortable! i'm 5'other 13other and have a long torso, so i ended up going with a large in this one because i like my shirts to hang loose. print is more vivid in person but nonetheless a great but!
other No size fit me. i'm normally a s to m. the small had huge armholes on me and the xs was just a wee bit off somehow. perhaps in length. so i ended up without it sadly. it's really a very nice top and great quality. i was unhappy to leave it behind.
other As other reviews have mentioned, this top has serious craftsman ship flaws. strings hanging off embellishments on sleeves and they begin unravelling as you try the top on. i wanted to love but sadly, returned asap.
other I bought navy in my usual size s, and the color and fit are exactly as pictured. very good quality cotton. the pocket can lay funny on the hips but a little adjustments does the trick. i wore this chemise at home and hubby noticed it (never happens), i wore it to study in coffee shop with boots and scarf and felt comfortable, warm and stylish. great staple, well made and well priced.
other I love the pilcro stet pants & want them in every color, every season! please retailer, never stop making thesepants. i also love the "new addition to the family": the pilcro capri pants & would love every color of these too!
other Really beautiful dress, too special for me as a guest at a wedding. i think this can be used as a wedding dress in an informal intimate wedding. it is shift dress, so not accentuate your body which is to be expected. it is running small. with my athletic body especially up top, the chest/arms are tight. i could have gone a size up but the body might be too big. i unto lately returned.
other This is a really beautiful top. the colors are lovely a subtle. it is larger than i expected. i ordered a small which is my usual size and it is more of a baggy tunic. it still works because the material is so sheer, but does not fit me like the photo size down
other Was surprised by the cute factor and great fit. the fabric is soft, it flows perfectly and isn't too long. it covers my rear. no gapping at the chest and i'm large busted. i got a large. the shirt is black and the florals in the pattern are a soft muted white. those little balls are small and more noticeable from the back. looks great under a jean jacket!
other Love this dress. i think i scored the deal of the year with this one. found it in my local retailer store. it had been in my "save for later" forever but i couldn't bring myself to pay full price... then it sold out in my size online. i was in my local store browsing the new items on sale with the additional 40% off, and there it was 1, and only 1. and my size.... i picked it up, noticed the cut outs that are not very apparent in the online photos, but it back, picked it back up, put it back.....
other I love this brand and the material of these shirts and have a ton similar and thought this was adorable with the sweet detail but it is super short and boxy and i felt uncomfortable with the length on me and it also made it so it wasn't so flattering on. such a bummer cuz its a sweet spin on a plain basic tee!
other I tried on this top in the ivory color in the store, but i didn't need another ivory-colored top, so i passed it up. however, i kept thinking about the pretty details, especially trim on the sleeves, so when i saw it online in the red color, i ordered it. i was surprised when it arrived with how thin and sheer the fabric is (the soft flowy mini-pleated body of the shirt; the other sections are flat cotton, which is more sturdy). i hadn't noticed this when i tried on the ivory version! but i'm ke
other I bought this blouse after i saw my aunt wearing it. the color is lovely. i spilled soup on it during my first wearing and it laundered wonderfully. i am so glad! such an easy piece to throw on, very comfortable. fit is great.
3 This swimsuit is very well made and even prettier in person. i'm 5'8" and about 14other pounds. i usually wear a size 6. i wear a 34d bra. i found the suit to run a bit small. i returned it because, despite how much i liked the style, it just wasn't flattering on my body type.
other This top is great - lightweight and flattering.i can wear it to work with skinny white pants or to the grocery store with jeans. i purchased another color because i love the first i got so much.
other I purchased this jacket in my local store. size 10 and runs really small . i love the color combination and design but the fabric in my opinion is poor quality. i have seen a lot of retailer use this poly spun knit in so much of their items and the jacket after bringing it home and looking in the light was already showing pilling. looks like it is worn in an bad way. returned the next day. this was a big disappointment and every time i see this fabric being used in retailer clothes it makes me mad.
other I love this sweater! the sky color is very flattering in person. i love that it looks good open or closed. i bought one for my mom and me. i think it will be very versatile. i think it runs mostly true to size, possibly runs just slightly big.
other This is my first pair of ag and i love them so far. they are not cuffed as shown in the picture. they are long so i had to get them altered (i'm 5''5). the color is a rich blue and they have a nice stretch. i haven't worn them all day yet to see if they keep their shape. usually a 28 or 29 and went with the 28 on these. got them on 20 perc off sale so very happy!
other This tunic is a lighter weight knit that isn't bulky to wear under coats, etc. it has grey shades running through the natural color which gives the knit more depth. it has a flattering fit. i bought it in the petite size and the length is perfect. i like the way the knit pattern runs two different directions in the front. it adds more interest to the look.
other I waited so long before trying this on because i have a bad addiction to white/cream tops that i'm trying to get over and branch out, but after seeing someone else wearing it i decided to give it a whirl. i was also trying on the black and white charlie's with the leaf print at the time and fell in love. it hits me a lot longer than the modeled photo (i'm about 5'7" for reference) and the shoulders were a little tight for me in my usual small, so i got a medium. the sleeve length is perfection,
other I adore this shirt. like a previous reviewer, the shirt runs a little small in the bust. i got a 6 instead of my typical other and it looks great. the quality is great and the color is lovely. the feel of the fabric is nice substantial weight.
other I'm 5'7", 12other lbs and i ordered these in a size small. i just got them in the mail and the print is really pretty and they seem very well-made. unfortunately, they were a little too small, particularly around my butt. after i ordered them, i read reviews on other merchants' websites and saw that many other stores recommend sizing up, as the brand is known to run small. i wish i had known before i ordered, but i'm exchanging them for a medium and i hope those fit better, because this suit is ador
3 I tried this top in xs in store.  i loved the macrame  detail and quality of fabric.  it billowed out too much below the chest and looked tent like.  my daughter laughed when she saw me in it- so did i!  i didn't buy it.  i'm 5'2", 115#.
other I fell in love with this dress online and went to try on in the store. i'm 5'6, 128 lbs with some boobs, usually a s or size 4. i tried on the s and xs, and ended up buying the xs - and i've never worn an xs in my life. it is long and loose, hanging right at my knees. the body is roomy, and i am thinking of having it taken in a couple of inches at the waist. there is pleating in the front that begins just below my natural waist and extends out to the hips, plus pockets (!!!). the sleeves are lon
other ....that's what i look like wearing this dress. a sad, sad, sack. the fabric is less than ideal, and there is no shape to speak of. i love that it has pockets but that's about it. there was just way too much fabric for a petite person. this dress has got to be good on someone, sadly that person was not me.
other Great jeans, great cut, great fit & i love the distressed look. the rise was higher than i thought but not a deal-breaker. i typically wear 26 in most brand of jeans & got these in 26.
other Very cute! waist is a little big for me but overall a pretty good fit.
other I'm so thrilled with these! the fabric is a little heavier, and they just fit really well when similar styles tend to be baggy.
other I am in love with this dress. ordered online in both my usual other and 6 (i go back and forth) and this time i kept the six. there is a little bit of stretch to the fabric but it has nice structure and the cap sleeves make it a welcome addition to my wardrobe. i plan on wearing this as a day-to-night dress since it's appropriate for work and for an evening out.
other Thank you to all of the reviewers who took the time to write a review. your reviews are what help me know exactly which size to order and how to know that i needed a regular instead of a petite. i'm 5'3 and typically wear a size 8 in retailer sizes. i went with a medium regular based on other reviews. thanks so much because the fit was perfect though still a little roomy.
other These paige skinny jeans are lightweight, snug, super soft and extremely flexible allowing for tons of movement. great for dressing up or down and a great addition to any ladies closet.
other This is so cute with a shirt or tee under neath. the look is better with a shirt underneath. very adorable for many occassions. i ordered the petite sizing b/c i like my pants more cropped.
other I saw this at my retailer store and hesitated to try it on as it looked so long. i'm only 5'1", so it goes to above my ankles. it's like a midi dress on me, but i really love it! it is so flattering. there is a inner lining that smoothes out anything you don't want to show. it's the usual bailey 4other great quality. so slimming! hugs the booty in the right way! definitely worth the money!
other You do not want to know how many cropped, wide-leg jeans i've tried on. all the rest make me look ridiculous for various reasons....it's not easy to get this style right, apparently. these are great: comfy, make my legs look cute, not chopped off, they are not mysteriously tight in the upper thigh (why do some do that?) they act like trousers with a jean's casual edge. the "let out" hem is super cute and they are soft and comfortable. perfect with tucked in or shorter blouse styles.i bought
other This top is adorable, especially the grey check. timeless staple, with a modern & cute update. i agree with 2nd reviewer; i don't think this blouse pulls or is tight in the chest. i'm also a 34d, i got a small, it fits perfectly & i wear it all the time - i think it's great for every season. very flattering, the peplum hits at just the right spot and defines the waist. i get compliments all the time. i pair it with cropped sweaters when it's cold. the grey does seem a bit higher quality; the blu
other Bought on a whim, on sale.  i am a small in 95% retailer but got these in m for comfy casual looseness--perfect.  i am 5'8", and these hit the top of my feet--perfect.  fabric is substantial but not heavy--perfect for cool so. cal evenings.   color is rich denimy blue--beautiful.  buttons are pretty. i have nothing negative to say about these aside from their price (even on sale).  oh, and the knot.  as i sit on my squishy leather sofa, i feel the knot in my back.  hmmm.  oh well.  still love them
other Someone returned my size so i got to try it on in store. the cut is very flattering, the material is stretchy. the lace part is nicely made too. overall great piece. the petite waist did hit me a little higher than on model, i have a regular torso and short legs (and overall usually need petite)
other I'm 5-months pregnant and wanted some beautiful tunics to mix it up between the usual maternity wear. this top is lovely! i love the cut, length and embroidered details however i am not a fan of the side slits. this will work much better post partum so i plan to keep it but my belly currently pulls the slits a bit awkward.
other I am 5'3" 130 and curvy and this dress fit me perfectly. it's great for parties and weddings (depending on how formal). the only reason i gave it four stars is because the fabric is a little strange; the ribbing for the squares is almost like a pillowy fabric, and it feels a little bit on the cheaper side but luckily it doesn't look cheap. nonetheless, i love this dress and would definitely recommend!
other Sale price is a great price for a cute cover-up.  so this is not a polite company dress.  this is a "i want to show off my cute underwear/bikini/cross-fit bod while i go get a cold pressed juice in venice" kind of dress.  or you can just wear it at home like i do.  runs small btw, so size up.
other I loved the texture and look of this skirt. very classy. but it fits tight-- i usually take a other or 6 on skirts depending on where the waistband hits and i could barely squeeze into the other and could not get it zipped. i'd need to go a size bigger in this one but now it's unavailable :(
other I adored this when i saw it online, paired with the leather skirt. i waisted impatiently for it to show up and, when it did, was happy at the price point but unsure of how it would feel. for the cut, i would say it runs tts. i am sometimes an xxs but in this case that size was tight across the shoulders. i am worried that the xs will be too roomy in the waist but time will tell. as for quality, well, you can feel the polyester in it, for sure. it's nice to have the lining, but i would not say it
other Got this in the "dark blue" wash; there is significantly less color variation than pictured online; it's a medium wash, and incredibly soft. i typically wear m or l in this brand due to very broad shoulders and muscular biceps: if you have a similar frame and you typically wear one of two sizes, go with your larger size.this feels incredibly silky. it's lightweight, so it can be worn (almost) year-round and will layer well over say, a tissue-style turtleneck in the winter. it's longer in the b
other I ordered this shirt online and didn't even try it on... it is super see through and i would need to wear a tank underneath and i don't want to have that extra layer in the summer.it is cute though!
other Quality piece except the fit is way off. i have a 3other c bust and long narrow torso, larger on the bottom. i ordered the small. i frequently wear a small/extra small on top and i was busting out of this in the chest area. however, the fit then flares way out from the torso and it just looked dumpy and overpowered my 6 foot frame. i marked it as running small, which it does on top, but then it runs very large on bottom. wanted it to work, but didn't.
3 Color is pretty true to pic, a bright blue red.  sleeves have more volume than pic.  so does the body.  in my opinion.  maybe if i looked like the model.  i wear a 27 in jeans and it doesn't look so cute on me.  also i'm a brunette.  angles?  pinning?  i have to wonder.  probably just pics at good angles.  it looks really cute on the model though.
3 I bought the tiny brand "cassia" tank last week in a small, and it fits beautifully. i ordered this "sorcha" tank in a small as well and it is huge! i am very sad about the huge size difference. look closely at the photos... the fabric twists as it goes over the shoulders to the back....it is quite bulky. hard to tell if that would minimize in a smaller size. my store doesn't carry this item so i can't easily try another.
other This is a beautiful sweatshirt. that is a sentence i've never said before! mine arrived with the sleeves rolled up, which made me think they probably pulled it off a mannequin or something. it made the sleeves sort of loose at the bottom, so i am hoping that they will "draw up" a little once i wash it. kind of bummed about that: for almost $100, they could have at least steamed it out or something so i could see the authentic fit. the sweatshirt is a little more square-fitting than it looks in t
other I am writing a review even though this is currently sold out (and was just released). what i love: the fit: snug, not too tight, and xs is true to size in the sense of historically. the wasit is cinched in, ample room in the chest. the fabric is substantial (thick and sturdy) and not prone to wrinkle, based on me having it in the bag in the hot car) and no false pleats was created. the sleeves are fun and different, may be a bit much for some. it is in multiple pieces, why it flutters so nicely.
other Wanted to love this dress. the fabric is very nice, pretty colors, great quality and style. it just didn't work for my body type. it would fit great on someone with narrower shoulders. probably want to size down.
other An awful dress! retailer why didn't you post my last review. i would not even give it a quarter of a star.
other I love this dress. you can wear it for everyday or you can put some bling with it and dress it up. it fits very well. flattering. i highly recommend!!
other I love this shirt!!! i ordered a medium and the sleeves were very long and the shirt was wide in general. i returned it for a small and it is perfect. size down! i love the comfy gauzy feel of this shirt.
other I purchased this swimsuit in the mint. gorgeous color combination. i'm 5'5" and weigh 117 lbs. i purchased a small. the fit is true to size. i love the front design; however, my husband promptly brought the back of the swimsuit to my attention. the chevron was off center. the design should have been centered with my back; however, it was on the right side of my back. i immediately called retailer assuming the product was defective. the item was sold out on line; however, a supervisor was able to l
other I know we've gotten to the point that polyester can be acceptable, but sometimes it's still that horrible texture, unbreathable mess. unfortunately, that's what this top is made out of. so it runs big, its billowy, and cute, but i couldn't get it off quick enough because of the feel of the fabric.
3 I think in general it is just hard to buy a bathing suit online, but i really underestimated the v-neck of this suit. i read the reviews and noted it was not recommended for girls with larger size breast. as i'm basically an a cup, i figured i would be fine. the top portion basically has no coverage or hold. even when tied very tight, the top still opened making me feel exposed and like my entire breast would fall out of the suit. needless to say my fiancã© was not a fan of the suit either. even
other Love the crushed velvet and tried it on in the regular sizing in blue, but really needed the petite. although i tried on the xs in the regular sizing, i was afraid i'd need my normal sp, so i ordered that instead of the xsp. should have stuck with the xsp and will be exchanging it for that size. it definitely is dress length (but dowdy dress length in the regular for me at 5'1") and the petite sizing is not all that much shorter, but enough to be cute. expecting a lot of use, especially over the
other The only reason i gave this top a other star, is that it didn't have enough room around the bust area. i'm a d cup, and the front didn't button properly. but for the price i paid (40% off sale price), i have no coplaints.i would recommend.
other I agree with the other reviewer. the colors were fabulous, but it was boxy and fit me like a sack. the slits on the side really detracted from the cute fabric and the hood drooped way in the back due to being able to pull away from the slits. it was really a cute idea and i'm sad it didn't work. i started not to order it based on the first review but i wanted to give it a chance,--i should have listened !
other Very pretty top. the fabric is wonderful! i enjoy the movement and the style. only downside is that it is cut a little low for me. but it does look great and the fit is, otherwise, perfect
3 Lovely style. i got the navy color and it's beautiful. i'm glad i ordered a smaller size after reading other reviews. my usual size would have been too big and not as figure flattering. but but but the sweater came pilled all over. i don't know if it had been worn and returned or if it's just the quality of the material but seriously there was pilling on the entire sweater. because the style is so nice and it fits well, i'm going to keep it and de-pill it but was disappointed with retailer :(
other This top is has an awkward neckline, doesn't lay like the photo (as mentioned by another reviewer.) see threw, and of poor quality. the fit is very baggy and unflattering. and material is very thin. it also runs very large!! the color is pretty, but that is it :(
other Gorgeous dress. perfect for something special. paired with black heels. runs a touch large. i normally wear a small (5'6 and 140 pounds) but i'm expecting so i sized up to a medium and it's very roomy. the sleeves do cap out a little too much but it's just so pretty i don't care! def a keeper.
other These flares are so soft and comfy they just may become my favorite go to jeans.i loved the higher rise because they don't feel like they're will fall off like many low cut jeans do.the material might be the softest jean fabric i have ever owned.love the braided styling around the pockets.the bell bottom may be a bit too wide for my liking but the other aspects make that one thing ok.
3 These looked so cute and colorful! very sad to receive them yesterday and having to return them today. cute overall, but run large. depending on cut/style, i range from 2-other in bottoms. i ordered a other in these, and they were just way too big. i would exchange for a zero, but i bought them for a trip this weekend. oh well.... consequence of online shopping!
other It looks like the stores are finally receiving their supply of this really pretty dress. i've been watching its availability online and was getting frustrated. my local store had ample supply. it's a beautiful dress! as per an earlier review, it does run a little large. i love that it's made of cotton so it will be perfect in the summer and beyond. it's a full skirt but looks really pretty on. my local store showed it belted which looked good too.
other I saw the "blue" version in my store (a return) in size 0. i decided to try it on and i loved it. it fit nicely, was comfortable and soft and the colors were flattering (and cut). (11other lbs, 30 dd, 26.other in waist), i contemplated purchasing, as i thought it was a bit pricey, but usually i order petite versions. and it wasn't available in that size, until it was. and i ordered it. it came and the fit of that one was great in the legs, much nicer than regular, but the top part was a bit small. the a
other I love the style, easy to wear to work or out for an evening. great quality.
other This dress is fun and flattering. love the pieced denim look and the a-line style. unlike other reviewers, i found this dress to be true to size for my pear-shaped figure. the length is long enough to wear anywhere, and i think it would be flattering on a variety of ages and figures.
other Could not say enough great things about this jacket. nice quality and drape and such a wearable, comfortable option as opposed to a more structured blazer. nice, true to size fit (petite small was perfect on my 5'2" 11other lbs frame--not too tight and not baggy, sleeves still 3/4.) will order an petite xs for my daughter, too. retailer, i would definitely buy other colors if you decide to order them.
other Love the design of the fabric. i actually bought these in both colors. i gave only other star due stitching on the fabric, it's very scratchy.
other Definitely a great silhouette. overall, it's just a really classic look that can hang around in your closet for years before it looks dated. that said, it runs small. i often have difficulty with clothing like this since i'm a 4-6 on the top and a 10-1other on the bottom (5'7" --- 35" 28" 41"!!!). my booty is definitely pushing some limits in this dress, but it does fit wearing a 6. shapewear to the rescue. conversely, my shoulders are petite, so the shoulders are a bit large. try this dress on in m
other This is exactly what i was looking for! a simple black blouse to pair with a bold pair of pants or skirt. falls nicely and the material is quite stretchy making it super comfortable.
other Usually retailer's designs run small for me, but this large fits great. super comfortable, long enough to wear with leggings. love the back cutout design and fabric choice. depending on bust size, it may seem to sit funny, but it's not meant to be a true baby doll design that sits under the bust. mine looks great :-)
other Another beautiful mave piece!! that is too big!! waiting for the size down to come in the mail. fingers crossed this works. the large was too overwhelming on my 5'6 frame. the tank that comes with it is soft and comfy and the gold accents really make this an outstanding number!! too bad no petite is offered. i ordered the black but it was hard to choose because the white also looks amazing. i predict lots of cooing over this lovely!!
other Like the idea but the tee was was very boxy. i tried the size small and it fit at the shoulders but the body was very big. i would say they pinned it for the product photo:)i'm 34a...usually a size small. it was soft and fun but a no for me at this price.
other This product is just what i wanted. it was a great color and nice quality for the price. it is tighter than the model, but i am curvy and that's usually the case. looks cute with a patterned pant and jewelry!
other I ordered other pair of these pants and the dye ran everywhere when i washed them according to instructions and then it came out with weird lines and splotches in the pants. i sent them back and retailer was very nice about replacing them. i have yet to wash my 2nd pair but we will see.
3 Love pilcro, love the stripes and the length - but this particular pair of capris/crops are super tight fitting. i went up a size from my usual and still felt tight. i guess its just the cut/fabric combo. i wanted it to be a slightly less form fitting feel ...... may work for you, however!
other I tried on this skirt in stores and loved it. the only thing is, i'm usually a other or a 26 and had to buy a 6. for reference, i'm 5' 7 and about 120 pounds. if you want to tuck a light sweater or really anything in, i'd recommend you go up a size as well!
3 The fabric is super soft and the grey is pretty, but it is light grey not dark grey as described when you select to buy it. my biggest issue with the top is that the cold shoulder arm reveals the entire arm, so if you aren't completely toned with your tricep and all over arm, it will show... which is why i bought this to hide my blunders
other I think this jumpsuit is different! the xs fit well and the material is a pretty color but very soft. the store had it styled with a metallic scarf that really accessorized it well.  i thought it would be great for my date night but stopped short of buying because i just can't picture this worn to other outings.  it is very unique though so i just might be back to purchase.
other I love this dress so much - the perfect summer dress. comfortable, easy to travel with and i get compliments on it all the time!
3 Maybe it's just me, but this skirt had a little more volume than i was expecting. i'm 5'7, around 125lbs and the small fit me well. i like that the waist is elastic in back providing some give, but allowing the front to look smooth. pockets are always great. i got a striped henley from retailer (which is awesome) to tuck into it & was excited for the 70s vibe.the problem is that it fell an inch or two longer on me than the model, and i already worry about midi skirts appearing frumpy without the
other This is now one of my favorite items in my wardrobe!! it is comfortable yet can be dressed up or down to fit any occasion.
other I originally ordered the regular xxs (loose fit = xxs nowadays) and the length was right above the knee... it looked great and classy/classic but i felt like perhaps the chest height would be better in petite. so i ordered the xxs p as well... decision time:i decided on petite because the overall dress fit my body better, though it is now shorter (a couple inches above the knee0. still looks classy with a boot, but flirtier. embroidery is beautiful, as others mentioned, fabric is comfortable
3 I ordered my usually size, xs, and it's just so wide and unflattering. looks like i'm wearing a tent. i don't understand why tops anymore are either huge or skin tight. why not something in between?!  the pink color is really pretty and the details are nice but it's just blah in terms of the fit.
other It is such a cute dress. the mulit-colored aspect allows me to wear many different color shoes with it. the dress can be formal or informal, and it works for a myriad of occasions. please purchase it!!!!
other I just received this in the mail and must say its one of my favorite purchases in a long time from retailer. the navy polka dot color combo is classic yet fun with the orange. looks great on its own as well as under a cardy. this will be in heavy rotation.
other I was looking for a holiday dress to wear to the nutcracker and what is more appropriate than a tulle skirt?! the tulle lays fairly flat so it's flattering rather than being poufy. the top is a thick material, but not quite sweater material. since the top is warmer, it should be fine for winter even with short sleeves (and a cute cardigan or furry coat#. i'm going to sparkle it up a bit with a necklace or belt, but it also looks fine without extra accessories. fits true to size, i'm typically a
other Since i only wear midi skirts, love the length of this one. the regular medium looks as pictured on me. well made and the dot texture is sweet. bui will be returning as the skirt is literally very heavy and the gathered waist is unflattering on me.
other I really loved the pattern and style of this dress! unfortunately, i had to return it because i have broad shoulders and it is a pretty stiff top that cut into the flabby area near my armpits. for most people it's probably perfect! but if you have wide shoulders or any concerns about the armpit flab, this might not be a great choice for you.
other I purchased the navy size small and was delighted with the fit. the waist line is perfectly proportioned for a petite. i think this means that the waist line will be high on a woman who needs regular sizing. i like the lining, it adds a substantial look to the dress.
other The fair-isle details are gorgeous and the wool is thick, but not itchy. the neckline is a perfect crew cut style- not too tight, but compliments the neck itself. the stitching has a lot of beautiful neutral colors so you can wear this with jeans, blue or gray cords, etc. so many options!!!
other Love the fabric of this button-down. runs really large, however. am usually a small or xs - so bought a 4. it's ok, but is incredibly boxy and stands away from the body -- & not in a good way. i think it probably works well tied at the waist, but, alas -- i am too old to be showing off that part of my anatomy. returned reluctantly! hope others will enjoy!
other I just love all pilcro pants. they are great for any occasion, any type of weather. i am 5'5" 12other lb. and i wear a 27 in all pilcro pants and they fit perfectly. only bummer is that i have to iron them, but they iron easily. length of these pants is just a tad long, but i can wear wedges with them and that solves the problem.
other I was not impressed upon first taking it out of the package, it was a wrinkled mess,lighter weight than i imagined and i felt like it hung like a potato sack. however after i gave it a good ironing and used the inside back tie to sinch in the waist i was in love. it draped beautiful, the blue has beautiful embroidered detail and i love the full length sleeves that can be rolled. i feel iike i will use for many seasons.
other I bought this top in the store, which was good because i ended up wearing a size smaller than i usually do. i loved the flowy fit of it. the washing instructions say machine wash cold, tumble dry low. i washed it on cold and hung it to dry. it shrank to the point of being unwearable (the dreaded button gap!) and lost its softness. i hope the store lets me return it.
other This skirt is really beautiful but i agree with the other reviewers; it runs very small. i'm typically an 8 or 10. if i get a 10, there is usually a bit of room in the item. i decided to get a 10 in this skirt, just in case. i got it zipped but would have trouble breathing as the evening wore on. the pockets are wonderful and the fabric is weighty and really lovely.
other The material is very soft and it looks just like it does on the model with the exception that it gets a little wrinkly at the hem and turns up at the corners. i like it and have already worn it a few times.
other Purchased this fun, feminine top right before vacation and wanted to wear it every single day. the peplum style isn't typically something i gravitate to, but this peplum is the perfect length and i love the sheer 3/other length sleeves. i chose the ivory version of this top and it was adorable with jeans, oxfords & a cute hat. for how beautiful this top is, i feel like the price tag is an absolute steal!
3 This dress arrived with a black rope belt and belt loops. i did not see this in the photo. i thought it was a throw-on-and-go dress, not a belted dress. this, in addition to the weird sizing, caused me to return it. i am a size 4-6 in dresses and the size small i ordered was skin tight and bunched at the hips.
other Beautiful color, great style/design. only drawback is it's not as soft as other cashmere i've purchased...got the xs and the fit is perfect!
other This top is beautifully constructed, fits true to size i ordered a medium - the armholes are nicely cut - not too loose will be able to wear with a racer back bra, accommodates my larger bust 34dd.
other Hi, i bought this top for my daughter. she absolutely loves it. the fabric is very substantial. it flows really nice. if i was younger i would buy one for myself. lol
other Love the material, pockets, length (i wear petitie - i'm 5'3) etc. i usually wear a medium, but this dress runs incredibly large. i was drowning in it and sadly had to return it. size one or two sizes down if you want to purchase!!
other I love the color of this cardigan and the cashmere is very soft. i love the detail in the stitching and how the zipper is covered. i do wish it were a bit longer but it's definitely a keeper.
other Great weekend toss around piece or with gym clothes.  the cut is flattering, yet not tight.  i purchased in other colos  b/c i liked it so much and was looking for a piece like this for a very long time! cute with yoga legging, jeans, sweats etc.
other I saw this initially in the store and thought it was nice but did not purchase because i thought the price was too high.  i saw it again and it was on sale but the store had sold out of my size.  i checked online and my size was available so i ordered.  i was afraid this cape would be to long and make me look frumpy but it wasn't and i didn't.  it looked great. i tie the belt a little higher than the model to make me look taller.   i can't wait to wear it on cool fall days.
other The shirt is a heavier weight than how it looks on the product page which was a nice surprise. it has a boxy shape and was shorter than expected. i'm 5'7" and the front of the shirt above the hips. the design and color is great. very happy overall.
other I normally take a small or medium in antrho tops, i ordered the xs/s and i'm kind of swimming in it. i think it's a good look though, and will complement shorts or skinny jeans. i could wear this through all seasons in the pnw so i expect to get a lot of use out of it! i was afraid the embroidered shoulders would be stiff and stick out but that isn't the case at all. the sweater is all soft and flowy, drapes nicely, and can be easily dressed up or down. worth the price.
other Quality was not what you expect from retailer, especially for the price. top is lined but skirt is not. material is tissue paper thin and see thru. there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat, it keeps popping up. however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives. was returned.
other I absolutely love this shawl/jacket! i usually use it as outerwear and it is the perfect piece for those in between weather days in new england when it's too cold for winter wear and not warm enough to go without a jacket. the black/brown works great with whatever you're wearing. so versatile and i love that it has pockets!
other Love these jeans however they get a little saggy in the front while wearing which i don't like :/
other The shirt does have a weird yellow tinge as other reviewers have described. i could get over that if the shirt was a flattering fit which it was not. not worth the money so i returned it.
other I love this dress! i purchased the neutral motif in a large and it fits wonderfully. i have a double d chest and the top of this fits almost perfectly. it's just a bit snug on top but still comfortable because of the fabric. i'm 5"3 and the dress isn't too long like most maxi's are on me. i always have great luck with maeve and plan on purchasing another right now!
other This dress is so cute, and i received so many compliments on it! i wore it on a gameday, and it was so comfortable. i love the skirt of the dress because of the trendy v's. the top was too loose for me, so i had to get it taken in. this is surprising because i have a decent sized chest and broad shoulders. other than that, this dress is a real winner!
other I was a little hesitant when i ordered this dress, but needed something for my husband's company dinner. this dress is perfection! i'm 5'9", about 160 (i got it in medium), definitely on the curvier side and this dress hugged all my curves in the right places! love the ruching, hides all the imperfections. the color is gorgeous, paired it with a black cardigan and black heeled shooties, got so many compliments! on a plus side, my husband couldn't keep his hands off me all night, kept going on an
other Super cute and comfy pull over. sizing is accurate. material has a little bit of stretch.
other I am wearing a large in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.
3 This is an adorable piece but the fit is a gamble. the crotch hung way too low for comfort on these so since i got a great sale price, i had them altered. i haven't worn them yet but i'm sure i'll get compliments when i do. so if you want to take chance on the fit and/or alter them, go for it!
other Pretty blush color that is still neutral enough to wear with just about any outfit. runs true to size imo. can't wait to wear it this fall/winter.
other I really like this shirt. i fell for it after seeing it paired with grey jeans, but when i searched the entire website i couldn't find it. then a couple of days later it appeared. i was super excited and i'm glad i ordered it. i was not disappointed. the shirt is soft and long enough to cover my waist area without riding up if i bent at the waist. the colors are very vibrant and its quite stylish. i ordered a medium and it fit perfectly.
other I'm always scared of rompers because of my height and long legs. but this one was perfect. it didn't ride up or hit in a weird spot on the hips. it's very flattering.
3 Tried the navy in store. boy does it run big! i'm normally a size 6 / small (ish). 5'6", 34a-28-36. the xs was still quite boxy on me while the sleeves were well fitted. i understand this is the style and i like the design with the different sleeves.it was a no buy as the main fabric was already pilling in store and looked a bit cheap - sorry!
3 This is a flattering, comfortable, soft sweater the instant you put it on. a few instants after that, however, i found mine had relaxed a great deal to become baggy, and pilled even more to become a fuzzy wuzzy monstrosity. i'm not optimistic about its longevity and wouldn't recommend it except for the extravagant single-use buyer.
other Beautiful piece, very well made and drapes well!!! i love it!!!! runs a little big, i'd go a size smaller.
other Very pretty design. hugs the body correctly. it's a little tight in the chest for me - i'm a 34c (large c) and i have some back chub so i'm using this fact to motivate me to get in shape for the spring. keeping the dress and hoping for a better fit in a few months.
other I had it on my wish list for a long time, not sure whether i should purchase, i even hesitated when it went on sale, but boy, am i glad i did order it... it is crazy comfortable, flattering, and love that it looks black but is blue... i ordered both xs and xs p and decided to go with the petite as it will look super cute in the fall with boots. not too short (i am other foot 1.5)... the fake leather part concerned me at first, but i like it now... nothing bad ot say about it!
other I love this shirt! it was a great price and very high quality. it has different material stitched in the inside
other These pants are extremely comfortable and flattering. i bought them in coral, and wore with a black peasant top, sandals and a long necklace. they do stretch out a lot though, so i would recommend sizing down. i bought mine to look like they fit on the model, and after a few hours they were hanging off of me, so buy them a little bit tighter than you like. the drawstring is purely decorative and does not tighten the waist.
other I wanted this top ever since i saw it online, it is so me. it's a nice mix of feminine and masculine, you can pair it with a nice pair of jeans or even business pants to dress it up. this will make the perfect summer shirt and it hangs so nicely! i highly recommend this shirt, i would get it before its gone!
other This sweater is a hit. the color is fantastic and the shoulder cutouts add a feminine and unique touch. looks amazing paired with booties, a statement necklace and jeans. definitely affordable too! highly recommend
other My preference is clothing made of natural fibers, but i couldn't resist trying this on once i felt it! the cut-out pattern in the fabric, the color,  the buttons & the design of the back all add to make a dress i'm going to wear with leather flip-flops during the day or wedges & a denim jacket at night. it's perfect for southern california fall (& likely much of winter this year) weather. i'm a 32d (& won't need/wear a bra) & although i usually wear a 6, i bought a 4. maeve, i like your style!
other I purchased this product online so wasn't able to try it on before purchase. it fits perfect. i am 5'7 and 160 lbs. the only thing i did not like was the fabric, it is very thin. you can see undergarment lines in the back.
other I ordered this shirt through the website hoping it would look like it did on the model, it does! very nice, thick fabric. fits true to size, no complaints at all.
other Love it - material is soft and color goes will with any color.
other I'm not sure how i feel about this shirt. i love the fabric, which is soft, lightweight, and richly colored. the polka dot trim is quirky and fun, and i like the idea of the twisted hem. the cut is generous in width, for sure; i ended up ordering a small because i swam in my usual medium-to-large sizes, but the length of the small barely works. the sleeves are juuuust long enough, and the shirt hits me just at the hip, not nearly as far down as the model shots show. it may be because i'm busty a
other I am usually between a 8 and a 10 and was an 8 in this skirt, it is very nice because it has so many soft colors in it and will go with anything. i live in florida so for me this is a fall skirt! i like the look of a wrap and it is not a wrap it fits great.
other Due to the prior review, this top came without any surprises.  i had read about the open sleeves and actually have a dress with a similar design.  this top can be dressed up or down and is perfect with skinny pants.
other Fun pattern which goes with just about anything. cool for summer.  very comfortable.  fitted style but true to size.
3 I so loved the look of this top and most of the reviews seemed really good. i thought the material was great and i ordered the blue which is a beautiful color....but......the fit was way off and the design is way off for a girl with hips. first the fit, the arm pits are low and don't actually tuck into where your armpits are, so you have this weird restriction in arm movement. then the design is not great either (and others mentioned this), the sweater at the bottom has way too much extra materi
other Love love this skirt! such a pretty green color and a great quality. this will be a staple in my closet for years to come. and i love a skirt with pockets.
other I ordered this in a small petite and medium petite , and i am a huge fan of a*k. i put tried on the sp. while it fit, it was very long, even for a petite. what i hated about it was that the piping on the top made me look very wide. even a long necklace wouldn't help deter the look. on a positive side, the blue was a very nice, cool color. i am usually a small to medium in a*k (6-8 in tops) and the small fit well in the arms/bodice, just too much fabric for me. returning!
other Retailer consistently provides unique, sophisticated and quality made clothing. with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies, i shop with them exclusively. i suppose that i can't expect 100% perfection from retailer-but 99% of the time-that's what i get. this is that 1%...this sweater is truly awful! i cannot (or find it very difficult at least) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that, had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front
other This dress is really pretty and fun. i can see where i can dress it up or tone it down. subtle pretty beading at the neck. just ran a bit big on me, i sent back for the next size down -can't wait to get it!
other This dress is much cuter in person than it looks on the model online. it's so flattering, it fits like a dream, and i love the fabric. i love that the skirt is a true a-line, not poofy, so it's sleek, slimming and flattering. the neckline is feminine and gorgeous and is a bit sexy, while still being classy. oh, and the length, perfection! not too long, not too short. i never ever pay full price and for this dress i had to. i am a curvy size other and it fits perfectly true to size. i couldn't be hap
other I love this top. i am 5'8", 135, 36d, ordered a small and it fit perfectly. length is long, but i liked it. i paired it with grey jeans and black wedge boots...love this top!
other I wore this jumpsuit to a newport wedding and got so many compliments! i'm 5'2" 10other lbs and the 0 petite was perfect with heels.
other I haven't worn these yet but i wouldn't wear them just to "lounge" in. i wear an xs & they fit good & tts. they have an elastic waist but it drapes nice & doesn't bunch like some do. the material is soft & hangs nice. & doesn't seems like it will wrinkle. love the pattern of the black print ones. it's black, tan & white & kind of a paisley print. i think it looks better on than in the picture.
other This is very cute but runs small. my typical xs is too small all over. arms are short and top is short and tight. i'll order a small and hope it fits.
other This is a beautiful and versatile skirt. i love the layered detail, length, and flattering cut. the fabric is a 80% cotton/20% linen blend. it's a thick weave with tiny nubs here and there. the skirt was made in turkey.i usually wear a size other in retailer skirts, but i sized down to a other in this skirt. the size other fit at my natural waist and looked as pictured on the model, whereas the other looked bulkier on me,
other Nice skirt. texture pattern gives it character. does run a bit large.
other I have been wearing joe's jean's for years and have a hefty stable of varieties in my wardrobe. recently, 3 pairs of their skinny leggings have worn out much quicker than expected which has caused me to question their construction and overall durability. i have had my eye on these pilco legging jeans for a while but every time i have gone to pull the trigger, my size has been sold out. finally, all the stars aligned just as i bid my final pair of joe's skinny's "adieu" and i was able to purchase
other It is so beautiful and just as shown in the pictures! very elegant! i normally wear a small and it hung off me just a little.
other The details and colors are exquisite. stop hesitating and get this dress
3 Tried this lovely with high waste, wide leg, black flowy pants. everything i could hope for and more, but not quite!size: blindly ordered size 6. i'm usually a small, occasionally xs in retailer brands like floreat and akemi+kin. i'm 5'5" tall, 130 lbs, 34d, 35-29-37, long torso, narrow shoulders, and short arms.fit: size 6 had just enough space through the bust. the lace edged sleeves were roomy and just reached my wrists. the shoulders were just right. extra fabric ballooned out around t
other I have wanted this dress since i first tried it on in april. finally got it as a birthday gift and after looking at it closely there was makeup on the collar. i checked the instructions and it says "cold water wash". so i washed only the collar part by hand and every part that got water on it bled!!! looks like the popsicles are melting! i'm so sad because this dress is adorable! i'm buying another in hopes retailer will make this right by taking back the first one. should be dry clean only!
other I bought this dress tonight and i love it! the fit is perfect and the color is perfect! the dress runs true to size, as all dolan products do. i ill wear this dress to an interview with tall heel boots. love this dress and think everyone should give it a try!
other Do not buy this dress for full price. the design looks great but after receiving the dress, the material is made of extremely cheap slinky-ish polyester that you would find at a f2other store. the stitching is horrific and created an uneven "hump" on the back seam. just absolutely poor poor quality.
other I love panties. i love the prettiest, softest, most adore-worthy panties i can find. these are my favorite boy shorts--i can always put them on and feel pretty. no weird tight spots and the lace has a perfect amount of stretch. im a mom and my body isn't perfect anymore, but these panties give me confidence, with perfect coverage. i choose them more often than any other in my lingerie drawer. my only warning: wash these pretties as delicates, or the lovely lace colors will fade.
other I was going to order a size other online but decided to check my local store first (hate paying for shipping - especially when so many retailers offer free shipping regardless of the purchase amount). all that was left was a 0 and 10. i decided to go ahead and try the 0 just for size comparison. i'm usually a size other but this dress fit perfect in the 0. a other probably would have been ok but may have been a bit looser in the top. i love the lace fabric on the top and the contrast it provides to the skir
other I was really lucky to pick up these shorts during the tag sale, and they are great! lightweight, roomy in the legs (way more my speed, i prefer shorts that don't cling) and really soft. they also weren't too short. i am usually between two sizes at retailer, depending on the brand, and ended up going with the smaller size. they're not really a size too big, but would've been a little too roomy/baggy in the waist, had i not purchased the smaller.
3 I took a risk on this dress despite the multiple reviews about the pouffy skirt and revealing neckline, because i loved the look of the blue motif print. alas, the adorable print, the handy bra-strap holders, and super-soft fabric were the only things that worked for me. i'm 5'3" and 120 lb, small up top, not especially curvy but not straight either, and i ordered my usual 2p. yup, the pleated skirt was much too full (i felt as though i was wearing a cheerleader's skirt) and the neckline was way
other Very nice top. flattering and goes with everything. i bought the medium in the green but would have needed the large in the white as the white was a little see through and showed more of my flaws. i agree with the other reviewer in that this top has good button placement.
3 I love the look of this dress and i love the way it is cut. the one thing i do not love is the thickness of the material. it is just too much for a summer dress. it just felt heavy and hot. i still love this brand so i am hopeful for a few more great options to come out before summer is over.
other I don't normally like "lace-up" details, but for some reason, i don't mind it on this top. it's a bit shorter than it looks on the model (and i'm not especially tall). the fabric is nice - not too heavy, not too lightweight. great for fall.
3 Lovely jeans, love the details in the cuff bottoms. the front of the jeans, the relaxed "boyfriend" part was just too relaxed for me - too much material there that it was unflattering. otherwise cute.
other This is really one of those items that hits it out of the park. first, the fit is great. it's relaxed without being oversized or tapering way out or way in or something odd like that. it's nearly universally flattering to most body types and it's easy to wear with nearly anything. shorts, jeans, trousers, pencil skirts.....it looks great dressed up or down. i also like that the pleats that create the ruffle are sewn nicely (sometimes my recent purchases from retailer have not been the best qua
other I was not in the market for a black blazer but saw this in store and had to try it on. the quality of the fabric and overall aesthetic is fantastic! love love love the gold buttons. this will look great for work, with jeans, or even as a cover up over a cute dress. i am a generally a size medium (sometimes small) and tend to fall between a 6 and 8, i went with the 8 in this jacket!
other Love love love this in the pink! not as big a big of the off-white, but it's nice too.
3 I wanted to love this top. the color is wonderful in the pink and the material is silky soft. it is huge though, i am a 3other dd and bought my usual small! i am going to exchange for an xs and am hoping it fits.
other I'm an xl in retailer tops, and the xl in this blouse fit wonderfully. i bought the blouse in black, but will also probably purchase it in the cream. the blouse is made very nicely, however i had to deal with about 6 embroidered pieces that were not knotted. i had to take a needle, and thread the loose pieces to the back of the blouse and then knot them in with the rest of the embroidery. some of the individual flowers just came out entirely. however, this is such a stunning blouse and i feel so g
other The fabric feels and hangs nicely. it's very versatile, you can dress up or down. i purchased the navy stripe one and wear with brown boots. thinking i might need one of the other two as well, perfect for texas winters!!
other I saw this sweater online and have been looking for a unique sleevless sweater for some time now. its a very beautiful sweater so i ordered it right away when i saw this design. i recieved the sweater in the mail and really wanted to love it but it just wasn't for me. its very well made and thick which i liked but i usually fit in small sized tops for retailer but they didn't have a small left in the sizes, i ordered a medium and it still ran small, i was very surprised. its was also disappointing
other I gave this other stars instead of five because the picture really does give you the impression that this "cardigan" has sleeves but actually it's a cape with a few stitches above the wrist. it's also quite short, i'm only other 5" and it hits me above my waist. this picture was clearly shot with the front pulled down, i bet if we saw the back it would be high above her waist. also, one of the buttons fell off the first time i wore it. i heard it fall thankfully so it was easy enough to sew back on but
other I ordered the black and white shirt thinking it was polka dots, but turned out to be stars instead which was even cuter. fits true to size and is very soft and comfortable. my first thought after trying it on was that i should have ordered another one!
other If i saw this online i would never have glanced at the picture twice. instead, i came across it at the store and immediately snatched it up to try on. the green is very spring-y and rich while the raised little dots give it a lovely texture overall. really adorable on and fits fine in the regular although i am usually petite.
other My only problem with the skirt was the length - it appears shorter in the pictures, and i can't take it up since it would mess up the front slit. i would have returned for the petite, but it was not available in the green color which i loved. even though the length is longer than i usually wear, i get non-stop compliments on the skirt. and, it's very versatile.
other Let's begin with the fabric....it's heavy, but not in a burdensome way. as soon as you put it on, you feel like you have a quality piece of clothing on. next: aesthetics---this dress is flowy and feminine. and a bonus, it made me look bustier than i am; perhaps because of the stripes. i didn't find myself pulling this dress up all the time. once i put it on, it stayed in place perfectly. bottom line: this dress goes from dressy to casual without a second thought. and it's on sale--grab this one
3 I liked the idea of the diagonal color block but the fit of this tee was odd on me.  too tight around arms and way big and boxy around the mid-section.  going back.
other Super comfortable pant. they don't feel or look like jeans, but will hug your body like jeans. i bought the regular, size 26 - they waist is not tight and i needed to roll up the bottoms about 1.other inches. i have not washed or dried these yet, but i imagine they will wash well.
other So different than anything in my closet. it's wide with a beautiful drape. fabric is soft but substantial. it has the cutest coral color lining the placket and inside of the lower sleeves. i sized down to a medium and could have gone to a small but i love the length and drape which might not translate in fit in the smaller size. so cute on.
3 This tank fit well and i loved the ruffle in the back and how it layed. but the front was not a good look and i will be retuning it.
other I had no idea this was considered sleepwear until after i bought it. i saw it in the store and promptly tried it on, it is really flattering. i wear it as a sweater dress on a regular basis. it is really comfortable, and is something you could dress up with booties or be more casual with cute tennis shoes like keds. i get compliments on it all the time. i also like the slit a lot.
other I have ordered many black and white dresses and end up getting cream and black. not this one! this is truly b&w! i love the stripes, the length (at the knee, 5'5") and the pockets! time will tell in terms of fabric as rayon is not the most durable. the collar seems to stay down which makes it look 70's but fabric tape easily fixed it. overall, i love it!
other Great style - can be dressed up or down.
other I ordered the blue version of this dress thinking the accent stripes were black. they were not ! they were wine colored. i liked the color, but not in combination with the other colors in the dress. black would have been a better look. i had to take it back. sad...
other Guess i should've looked at the pictures more closely. i ordered the white version and in the pictures you can't see that the sleeves are split - and it barely shows in the picture for the blue version. it also would've helped if the detail of the sleeves were noted in the item description. anyway, i will be returning this top because i don't like the way the sleeves look each time i bend my arms. looks a bit pirate-like to me.
other The skirt looked orange online, but is more of a nice red (i do like orange too though).i had orginially palced this in my basket as a to order later to see, but my store had it. glad because i would have ordered petite, adn i do think that would have been too short for me (not appropirate for work or (in my opinion0, my age). the skirt (size 0 regular), fit my waste, and fell about one inch above my knee. i am 5'1.5" (11other lbs if it helps#... so petite would have been short.the only thing tha
other I bought the blue and the white - the white is very sheer. the fabric is more scratchy on the outside than the inside - i wore it the whole day and it was not an issue for me.
other Believe the reviews - this dress is very flattering, great quality, and an excellent print (i got the polka dot). i was concerned about the wrap front since i am busty - 32dd - but this looks great, is appropriate for work. love!
other Super easy date or work dress. it's a little small in the bust so i had to size up but otherwise a great fit.
other These are a beautiful color, but run large. i ordered my usual size and they are falling off of me. they are very low rise so i don't think i'll be trying the smaller size, can't even imagine them being lower. also, they are cropped, that's hard to tell in the picture.
other The shirts fits well. it is very soft and stretchy but thick enough that it's not see through. the collar is the best part. i wear small and i'm 5'3.
other Very cute top! even prettier in person! i ordered it by mistake but i am definitely keeping it! the regular xs size fits perfectly (i was concerned about my twin sisters!)
other I absolutely love this dress! the fabric is very light and airy while not being revealing. the color, being nude as indicated, is a nice change from plain white or off white and the embroidery is just beautiful and makes this dress quite unique. i love the fact that it is a tunic dress which lends to less of a structured look and more of an easy casual style. i recently wore this dress to an out door bbq and was both cool and comfortable all day. i also received many compliments from friends and
other I bought this dress after eyeing it up for weeks - it's really stunning. the red is incredibly vibrant, especially for linen, and the construction is very high-quality. since it's linen, it feels crisp and light, and you can layer it up nicely with a pullover or roll up the sleeves for flat-out hot days. the rayon slip is a really nice touch, too, since the linen is fairly transparent. it really drove home the sense of quality for me. i bought mine in size 0-regular, which i found slightly big i
other I love this shirt. it is soft, romantic and flowy.  i love the material it is probably one of the softest things i own. great quality and lightweight.
3 Facing the mirror--near perfection. high waist emphasizes the narrowest part of the frame--pleats nicely hide any stomach flaws. color is an eye-catching deep mustardy perfection and the interlocking button pattern is creative and beautiful. the problem is the walk away. from that view, the skirt waist finishes just where there's a bit of extra flesh. the cut is more of a long a-line--fairly boxy--and the heaviness of the cotton maintains that structure, so while the look as you approach walking
other Saw this in the greenville, sc store, and it caught my eye. i ordered a petite a week later, and i adore it. nice embroidery. a little sparkle. the sleeves are voluminous, but it makes me feel sassy.
other I love these jeans. the fabric is super, super soft with good stretch and give, however they don't loose their shape either. they are mid-rise but a touch higher in the back so you never give anyone an unwanted show when you bend over. my only complaint - and this is just personal preference - is that the back pockets are kind of small. but the comfort outweighs any slight beef i have. for reference, i am 5'4" and wear size 25. comfy, go-to's.
other Recently wore this lovely dress during business trip - was stopped four times while walking thru orlando airport. the design is extremely comfortable, the print will make you and others smile. so elegant and fun. the beading on the flowers is elegant. such a unique piece
other Love this shirt. i am 5'2" and 11other lbs. i am normally a pxs and got the pxxs and it got perfect! my new favorite shirt.
other I am all about beach cover ups. i already have the leblon one from this season (which i loooooove) but i love this one too-and it is in my go-to color which is fantastic! i love beach cover ups, i always imagine the sounds of the birds, waves rolling in, and a nice breeze allowing it to flow as i walk along side the beach. my reality, of course, is chasing after screaming kids and walking along a mn pond (not rolling waves) but this dress would at least make me feel like i am in my own little wo
other I purchased this for travel for a work meeting, i paired black slim pants under with heels-i added a long simple necklace and it was perfection. after getting a little wrinkled in my suitcase, i simply hung up while i showered and the wrinkles fell right out.it was comfortable, traveled well, was light, but looked very professional. you could wear tights under with boots or i can see in the spring with fun nude shoes.dolan always hits a home run- every dolan piece i have i still wear, years l
other I agree with the other reviews, this top runs large so size down. with that being said, this is a beautiful top, love it!
other I'm not sure why the other reviewers think that this runs small. in my opinion it runs pretty large. i am normally a medium and i ended up returning the medium to get the small. i do have a small bust (36b) and skinny arms so maybe that's why? regardless it is super cute and i think it can be dressed up or down. it looks awesome with the pilcro jean jacket!
other I tossed this in my bag (online) at the last minute thinking i'd give it a shot. so glad i did. this is dress is so simple and so much more flattering then i expected. you can dress it up or down. i wish it was about 1/other inch longer but still a good length for me (things are always too short for me). the material could be a little thicker but then i suppose it would lose the bounce that is so key to the flow of thing with this dress.
other Beautiful skirt but runs small. not for eveyone- this is for those with flat stomachs. i had to size up from a 6 to an 8 for my stomach to not stick out in this skirt and then it looked to wide on the bottom and lost the slick pencil look. if you are fit and firm this is a gorgeous skirt. it is lined and fabric somewhat heavy.
other Top was featured in an email ad. i love the colors in both tops and bought both plaids. i'm 5'4", about 130 lbs, and the medium fits well. it is long in the back, but i like that. if the front were a little longer, i'd prefer that, but the length is ok. the colors are definitely cheery and mood-enhancing, very appropriate for this holiday season.
other Usually wear s and xs, tried this in s at store but the sides were still lumpy after zipping the size zipper up. if i tried xs it would have looked better but may be bit too tight. the sides of the arm holes were also cut very low. it also has a dusty grey sheen to it that makes it look like old velvet in a bad way. two layers, green on outside, and a polyester beige layer underneath.but definitely a showpiece that can be paired with a short jacket.
other I agree with one of the reviewers that the armholes on this dress are big; however, the garment is tight around my chest area (even though i am not chesty) and lays next to my body perfectly so this is not problematic. i don't feel like they are gaping holes, there is just more area there than i would be used to. i like the fabric this is made out of. it is not quite as soft as i had hoped, but it is comfortable. i would say it is a medium weight-a little more than i was expecting. the flare is
other This top in the remaining blue - green is not the top pictured.  it's like the photos posted in a recent review by inwonderland.  the color is deep and beautiful.  the neck is high, the lace is floral, there's a seam under the bust with a center pleat falling from it.  there's no reason for hesitancy at the sale price.
other Love this dress!! i layer spanx and a seamless tank underneath, as the fabric would show everything if worn on it's own.
3 This sweater is big and box. it looks very similar on as it does on the model. as other reviewers have mentioned, the embroidery on the shoulders is a bit itchy.
other This is a super cute t-shirt!  it runs a little big and not as long as some t-shirts which is good.   it hits mid-hip on me and i'm 5'7".    i got the gray at my retailer store and liked it so much i ordered the black one too.   warning:  the black one is actually a brownish-black which i didn't like so back it goes.
other I wish i had sized up on this one. you can't tell from the photo, but has kind of a weird taper thing where the sides are shorter than the back. the back is extremely flatteringly, but the front... not so much. the shorter sides are a little awkward. there is no attached way to fasten this cardigan, and it lays kind of strange. the material is a medium thickness and i think will be very versatile. very soft, of course. i got the blue/ teal color. i found the color to be true to the color on-line
other Love this sweater and it is so soft and cozy cause it has a little wool in it...not scratchy at all.  5'other 138# usually wear size 6.  i got a small regular (not petite).  looks great with leggings and skirts not to long for a shorty like me.
other This dress is stunning. the combinations of patterns/fabrics is beautiful and the cut is very flattering. i tend to wear a 6 or 8 depending on brand and the 8 fits perfectly. i am 32c on top and more of an apple than a pear shape, so the straight lines hide the tummy but shape the hips. love love love. i can't wait to wear this.
other This dress is a beauty. i am 5'11" and plan to wear this as a tunic over leggings or straight leg pants. the embroidery is really pretty, even though it does run a bit big. i would have liked a size 1other or less but it was completely sold out except for a size 14. it is so nice, with gorgeous high quality denim that i will make the best of it - may need to get some tailoring but in my mind, this dress is so worth it.
other This dress is everything i wanted it to be. i bought it to wear to a winter wedding and the material is perfect for that! i initially ordered it in a 0 regular and ended up having to exchange it for a 0 petite and it fits absolutely perfectly! the detailing on the shoulder is beautiful.
other This dress is the opitome of summer! day or night, running errands during the day to a casual night out this dress will be that go to favorite. i feel it runs small on the top, i am large busted and i sized up for this reason and it still could be roomier...i wear a size 10 on top and for referance i got the 12. i will keep it as it is not uncomfortable but for a drees that lends to a drape on top i wish they would have made it roomier....imhave never had this issue with mauve as it is one of my
other I am obsessed with these shorts. i bought blue ones last year and loved them so much i needed another pair. i purchased the gray ones and they are a beautiful hue, even with my pale legs. i think they will be very versatile. the fit is perfect!! hits at just the right length to be flattering and appropriate, not too short. super comfy. i am fuller on the bottom so shorts are tough to find, and these are truly amazing. i can't wait to wear them when it gets warmer! for reference i am 5' 4" about
other It is a great sweater that is soft but also warm i love the pretty design
3 This is not worth $128. it looks cute on but....there is no support in the bust area. just a slight tuck in the fabric -it also is very flowy which is great and it is comfortable but for the price and the thinness and lack of meatiness to the fabric itself i cannot recommend and will be returning. i'll look for something else. i haven't bought from retailer in a dogs age and i hope the quality hasn't slipped - i will look for another option.
other I am consistently a size 27 in pilcro jeans and these are no exception. these are more ankle length than cropped on me as i am 5'3" but i still love them. i found them to be true to size. because they don't have much stretch, they are a little snug in the thigh at first but the denim gives a bit throughout the day. the shorter length with the little flare is so versatile - they look great with a dressy top and heels and just as good with a cozy sweater and flat chelsea boots. love pilcro!!!
other I do not know where to begin....this sweater exceeds my expectation! i ordered this along with the mes demoiselles fringed sweater and i thought that was the game stopper....as beautiful as that one is...this one made my mouth fall open. it is unlike anything i have. it is an oversized substantial chic piece that is all over the runways. not to mention the color that i can not stop staring at and it will go with everything! order your regular size as it is suppose to be big!
other Seafolly is my favorite brand in swimwear. i've collected a few over the years. i was so happy to find this print. the little umbrellas are so cute and fun. i am normally a size 8 in seafolly and this one ran true to size.
other I love drop shoulder sweaters and find them to be very flattering so i took a chance on this one despite the reviews stating it runs very large. i was attracted to the style as well as the natural cotton fiber, which i find holds up best over time. i am 34b and usually wear xs or small and in this i ordered the xs. it fits perfectly! i layered this soft pink sweater over a rounded hem tee with a black and white pattern; so cute! it is slightly short on my 5'8" frame so the shirt tail hems peeked
other What an adorable print!  yes, it may be a bit juvenile for someone my age but i don't care.  the toucans are rendered in soft primary colors.  the skirt is swingy but not poufy.  whole dress is lined so thankfully it's not a see through white fabric.  the bodice in medium petite fits me just perfectly (36dd) so if you are slender on top, size down.  agree with the previous reviewer about the zipper, which i find to be cheap and irritating, especially when zipping over the waistband.  worried abo
other I don't usually have the best luck with pants from retailer but something made me try these on. i am so glad i did! i love the fit and the fabric, they are so soft and comfortable.. i loved them so much that i bought an additional pair of the grey wanted the turquoise but they were sold out of my size so i settled on the sand... i will definitely try other styles of the pilcro.
other I love that this top is dressy, yet comfy. it is perfect for work and relaxing with friends after. i recommend purchasing this blouse.
other I normally wear 0 in retailer dresses. the bottom is roomy but top from band up runs small. i bought a other and love it. i plan to wear it to a wedding.
other I bought this top for my daughter and it looks beautiful. it's a pretty jade green color and has a nice flow to it. the back is very flattering as well.
other I purchased this with some hesitation, having read that some people thought it was unflattering. but i couldn't resist the sale price, and i love a low-maintenance work top and doesn't require ironing. this fits the bill perfectly. it's made of high quality fabric, there's a soft inner lining with a side zip closure, and it has a pretty narrow profile so initially i found it a little snug to wiggle into (i got a small), but once on it fit perfectly, and is so flattering i can't imagine why other
other This is my favorite jumpsuit purchase of the season. flattering, casual look. well made light material. easy to dress up or down. can't wait to wear it again!
other This top is well made and would be cute but huge. this top has no shape and is way big. back this goes.j
other Other than the color (i got the rose color), which is great, i think my favorite part about this jacket is that the sleeves are actually long enough. i am 5'7" and the sleeves come right to my wrists, if not just a tad longer onto my hands. it's also got some stretch to it so it doesn't make you feel to stiff as you wear it; you can move in it :) it's very comfortable and pretty.
other These fit much better than expected. they are made of a very comfortable lightweight fabric. not very substantial, but they will be great for the summer. i was worried that they would be too roomy in the hip area, but the cut is rather flattering. such a great deal at the sale price.
other I really liked the fit and feel of these pants except the bottom of the pant leg was more bell shaped than i wanted (bought white pilcro culottes last year and they weren't like this), but it wasn't a deal breaker. when i got home, i tried to pair the chocolate pants with something to wear in the summer, but it wasn't working for me. i think the color was just too dark and fall-feeling. they do run big, so i'd think about sizing down ... definitely worth giving them a try if you're okay with the
other Light weight jacket, perfect layering piece . short enough to be the right accessory over a dress or skirt without getting a sloppy look. versatile, - also great over a long tee with skinny jeans. well made, fold cuffs back for the classic look.
other I really wanted to love this dress, but it just didn't fit in anyway. i ordered an xs petite, and it was very large. the lacing in the back is completely useless, and that's what i liked about the dress. i was thinking it would be unlaced more at the top (because of chest) and then lace more tightly near the waist. it was completely closed off and the dress was still very loose and unflattering. beautiful fabric, great color combo, bad fit.
other This dress is even better in person. the base color of the fabric is a very light peach, and very lovely. as you can see from the photos, the green floral pattern running up the front of the dress varies slightly from dress to dress, but i found the front on mine was very similar to the 1st photo. the bright green flowers are a light mint green, which plays beautifully with the light peach. there are more details in the print to discover in person, which is a nice bonus. the silk is not stiff li
other I fell in love with this dress immediately. gorgeous print and colors. light and breezy. classic and comfortable. the petite length is perfect for my height and hits a few inches above the knee. i have a small bust (34a) but a wider rib cage so the petite small was a perfect fit. couldn't be more pleased with this purchase.
other This dress is fun to wear! i wear the purple one flowy and get lots of compliments. i haven't worn the navy yet, but when i do it will be belted. my only complaint is the material that is used at the shoulders shows bra/slip straps. luckily it isn't too noticeable but a design flaw worth mentioning nonetheless.
other I bought this top about 3 weeks ago& love it! i like it because it's better than a plain t-shirt so it's perfect for running around doing errands or shopping. i like the material and the length, i'm 5'8" and sometimes i feel like shirts are to short. i wash it and hang it to dry, no shrinking or pilling so far! i am ordering this in at least two more colors!
other Very comfortable, but ran small. great quality and great look.
other I love my new blazer! the material is very soft and comfortable, and very nice quality, but not too "wooly" to wear into spring. the cut is very flattering, and the patterns and fringe details are very eye-catching. i am 5'6" and usually wear a size s in retailer and this small fit perfectly. they grey/cream color combo is gorgeous and looks very versatile, and can be dressed up or down.the one alteration i suggest is moving the button; at the shoulder it gives a wide boxy shape. my tailor wil
other I got this dress in a petite xs. i'm 5'4" and 110lbs. it fit just right. i usually wear a regularl xs in most brands, but with retailer, i noticed i always have to go to the petittes. anyway, the dress is super cute. love the diagonal striping and the draping is not too poofy which is great. the material is very lightweight on the bottom - which is good for spring/summer.
other Such a cute jean! got these specifically for the tie up lace ankle (and price)! also love the shade of gray i bought.
other I purchased this top in the black and tan color, loved the fit, style and fabric. however, it is a loose weave and after just one wearing a hole opened up on the front, which could not be repaired. it was covered by the cowl neck collar but as the day wore on the hole got bagger and it can no longer be hidden. i was very disappointed in the quality of this top- i purchased it at full price and was only able to wear it once. i just didn't have the time to return it to the store.
other These pants are beautiful. great fit and great fabric. really comfortable and elegant. i am tall 5'8" and have a long torso so it's nice to find pants that are high waisted.
other I adore these jeans! i bought them in a size 3other but probably could have gone with a 30. i decided to keep them anyway and have been very pleased. the fit is flattering. the color is perfect! i prefer these gray jeans to any other color for most outfits. the waist is a little higher than i'm used to, but that makes the fit even more flattering and helps prevent the "sagging out" issue that my older paige skinny jeans have.i love these jeans and definitely recommend them for hourglass shapes. mo
other -this was actually at my local retailer store. it reminded me of another online exclusive that was a dress and had the same flower shapes but the color was a soft pink; this is exactly like that._____________pros:- it is so lovely with the pleated front
other When i received the dress, it was true to size on the bust and length. i didn't purchase the petite, but i wish i did since i am 5'2. i tried to wear my wedges, but it's still long. i love the dress and would definitely recommend it.
3 I loved the lines in this jacket, but ended up returning it because they didn't show up how i expected. the jacket had a surprisingly baggy fit (s on my usual s/4/6) and wasn't quite what i was looking for.
other I love these pants! they are comfortable and dressy enough for work! the wide leg is the perfect size and the higher waist is professional! these are also nice and long for wearing heels. i ordered a size 27 and they fit great. i normally wear a size 6 in us sizing.
other I ordered the gold in size xl. it fits true to size, matching the online photos. the color & details are prettier in person. such a comfortable tee. it's washed/dried well too. i hope they make more colors for this fall. it's been a great basic!
other I bought this shirt to wear to work (i'm a teacher). this shirt is so amazing. i'm able to pair it with work pants to dress it up, and in denim to dress it down. the cut is incredible, with the peplum waist coming right below my breasts a little above my waist. the length is perfect, and it just seems to create the most perfect shape. the material is high quality, and i just love the fabric texture. it's very soft, and gives a tiny bit of stretch, but not much. i did size up in this shirt (i'm u
other I highly recommend this dress! it is super flattering and i got so many compliments. it fits like a glove and honestly made me look 10 lbs thinner. very romantic and has great movement. the length is perfect, since the top is quite modest, it's nice that it's on the shorter side - makes it a little flirty! i wasn't sure of the pattern at first, but it fit so perfectly that i overlooked it and bought it anyway. by the end of the night i was in love with the pattern. it really stood out and i can'
other Beautiful fabric with soft drape. unfortunately the "captain kangaroo" pockets are awful. unless you have a straight up and down shape with no hips this is very unflattering. the pockets look like saddle bags and add a huge amount of fabric where most people don't want added bulk. very disappointing. returned.
other Unique and stylish dress, looks much better on than in the pictures.
other I'm an xl in retailer tops, and to be frank sometimes some of the xl are too fitted and i return them. i bought this blouse in size large and it fits loose everywhere. it drapes very nicely in the front and back, and the arms fit loose. i'm making a point to say this to let people know to size down. -i was concerned this blouse might be too short because it looks very short on the model, but for me it hits at a nice length; i have a short waist and am busty. the lace doesn't hit my neck
other This is a beautiful, artistic piece for your wardrobe! seriously, rosie neira is a talented, london-based designer, who will thrill you with her vision. she is expert at making a woman look amazing from every direction; these knits are stunning, the materials and workmanship flawless. the medium fits me as expected (size 8, medium top, 34f). i was drawn to this by the rosie neira label, the flowing front drape and slightly longer back, the gorgeous knit quality and design, and the way it makes m
3 I love the details and design of this top- my only issue is the top is a bit too "flowy".
other I like this top a lot - it's cuter in person than it looks on the model -- it's a little heathered. it definitely fits slimmer one me than on the model, and i'm pretty small on top.overall, nice to see a reasonably priced basic t on the retailer site
other After a long wait for this dress to come in. i finally received it! the wait was worth it!the colors and pattern are just like they are online. the length comes right to to the top of my knees...i am 5'7". a couple of things to note: the sleeves are narrow,. if you have skinny arms, no problem. the fit across the bust is snug enough that if you have a large bust, there will probably be a gap at the buttons. there are gathers at the shoulder giving the sleeve a slight puffed shoulder. if you
other I'm so happy i decided to take a chance and order this top. it is gorgeous! so flattering on, the perfect length, beautiful colors. i could go on and on. peplums can be tough but this one hits perfectly on me. runs true to retailer sizing so stick with what you normally order. i'm 5'6" and 125lb and the s was for me.
other I was fortunate to order the perfect size the first time. i am 5'3" and 12other and ordered the size 4. it is a great fit. these lightweight pants are super cute and i especially love the way they are cut to dip a bit lower (not asymmetrical, just talking about the drape) on the inside hem so outside hem is perky and the bottom looks wide and is flattering. these zip up the back and the back lays flat which is also flattering. i love the look of the fabric so if i have a complaint it's that for the
other This top does look better online and one reviewer said. it also looks good in-person but runs small. i usually wear xl, in some cases l. i tried l, it was small so i sent it back for xl. the xl fit perfectly at the top but was tight at the bottom. the bottom pulled at the seams, so i am sending it back. the embroidery itself is very pretty, it is a nice dressy top that can be worn with multiple colored pants or leggings. it just didn't fit me at the bottom. i think it would work better for a lea
other A must have sweater with great details. it can be a star piece with leather tights or very long flare jeans. i recommend platform booties for perfect body proportion.
other I love this top! i typically wear a size small and this is very true to size. it's loose fitting but does not make you look large. the pattern on the material is also fun without being too busy. perfect for fall!
other My only reservation is that i wish the tail wasn't so much longer than the front. i returned it reluctantly because i needed something just a little dressier for the occasion.
other This is a very awkward and unflattering shirt. i am very petite--90 pounds and 5'2". the arms fit--length and width, but nothing else about this fit. the scoop was so low and wide that i would require a shirt underneath. it fell exactly like a tent and made a bell shape around my thighs. yikes! it looks cute on the model, but not on me. the material is also very thin and felt sort of like it should be a pajama top.
other I love this sweater and don't think the pics do it justice. i ordered the light blue/lavender color and couldn't be happier. it's great with leggings or jeans and booties or boots. i received many compliments the one time i've worn it so far. so glad to have snagged this on sale but i wouldn't have hesitated to pay full price!
other I wore this to my retirement party; i wanted something special for a once in a lifetime event. i wanted something that was dressy, while also being unique so i wouldn't look like everyone else. almost without exception, from my boyfriend to everyone i talked with, mentioned my dress. the design is so unique, making me feel even more special on my special day. it's beautiful, yet comfortable. the stretchy sides made it feel snug without pinching or discomfort. really a fun dress to wear. i'm sure
3 I was so excited to receive this in the mail as it had been on backorder for awhile. the dress is beautiful, but run smalls the buttons on the back are nearly impossible to fasten. if you are single, good luck trying to get it buttoned. i'll be returning it.
other Loved the chocolate ones so much, i went back for the rose. my first thought when i tried them on was, "i could live in these!" honestly a very comfortable pant.
other I'm seriously in awe of this fun dress! the beading, fuzzy flowers and embroidery on the peachy dress make me very happy. it's nice to wear by itself with a simple necklace but i love it more with my cropped jackets--my dark denim for a casual air or the tailored tuxedo black for date night! like others have said, this dress has many layers and is surprisingly heavy. definitely not for hot humid weather or i'd melt and cry. thank you so much to the reviewer who advised sizing up for the ar
other This skirt is beautiful...the color is definitely more a greeny-gold then a true yellow gold...nice quality fabric, has some stretch, big pockets with cute lining, buttons are adorable, perfect knee length, sits higher on the waist. because it's not lined and the pockets are big, the pocket line is visible on my thigh area, so i am going up a size just so i don't see that...if you have less curves, your regular size should be perfect. it has so much character, but it!!
other I tried these in store, didn't have much hope as flare usually looks terrible on me (small waist and athletic, fuller legs). but surprisingly these work great. they seem to very good quality and the flare is super cute and on trend. i do think they run a little small. i am almost always a 2/26, but i took these in a 4. they didn't have a other in store for me to compare but i think they would have been too tight. highly recommend!
other Beautiful dress, but has an unflattering fit. i purchased an xs and it's past my knees and the bottom of the dress is so heavy! would be a perfect maternity dress though!
other Versatile piece to finish out your look. love how it goes with so much of my wardrobe. simple, comfortable, and classic.
other Love the unique details and neutral color scheme. top is boxy but i liked the way it looked on my 5'2" 11other lb. frame. it's comfortable and well made. thicker material.  seems to be holding up fine after one washing.  looks great with skinny jeans.  highly recommend!
other These pants have great style and movement.
other These jeans really look very nice on. they are 99% cotton and 1% elastaine. if you want the look that you see on this model, order one size up. i am 5'9"/136 lbs. bought both 27 and 28. decided to keep the 28. mainly because the lower part of the leg was fitting too tight in the 27, looked more like a skinny jean but bunched up at the knee -- they are tapered. (i also own a pair of 100% cotton levi's wedgie in foot hills in size 27 which fit a bit different than these -- the foot hills definitel
other I am in love with this dress. not too dressy, not too casual and hugs the body in all the right spots. i am 5'7 with curves and this flatters well. i also bought (and adore) the velvet taupe ankle strap shoes they show with them, super in-love with the whole look. dress will look great with booties too. just hope i don't snag the sweater dress, which looks easy to do, because i want to wear this all fall and winter long.
other Wasn't sure about this top based on reviews, but glad i purchased! pretty print, looks great with denim. very loose, flowy top. hangs a little short, but that's the style of this blouse. fit true to size. i usually wear a 2/other and xs/sm with 30dd. size small worked for me.
other Great fit in waist, hips and butt. i wore them all day and they did not stretch out.i am tall but the length of the jeans with the cuff is a tiny bit past my ankle bone. i want it just above the ankle bone so i am re-doing the cuff slightly and then i must send these to my tailor to close the cuff completely. they look silly when the big cuff isn't at least tacked in place. perhaps by design they were left this way so each of us buyers could find the proper length and close the cuff ourselves.
other I purchased this tank for the interesting open neck not realizing that the straps are elastic. i love it. the material is super soft and it fits nicely. snug but not too tight. the straps are wide enough to cover bra straps and the neckline being a little wider is really flattering. i got the black one but i am going to get more colors! great buy!
other This was exactly as expected. i ordered my usual size medium. fit well. good quality fabric. it's one of my comfy weekend go to items.
other I love these pants so much and have worn them so many times in a week! they are comfy and causal, but still chic and presentable. these pants run true to size and are great for so many things- running errands, working out, lounging around, being casual and cool, etc., etc, etc! after buying these on sale, and loving them, i knew i needed more and purchased two more pairs. i definitely recommend these for anyone who wants both comfort and style.
other This blazer looks great on the model and i have a long torso so i thought it would be perfect. when i got it it looked like a big box and didn't fit anywhere. the shoulder pads were giant and the bottom of the coat was huge. i got a small based on other reviews, but it was way too big. sadly, i had to return it.
other I love this top!! the detail on front top of the top is so cute. the length is just right. i hesitated because of the unusual armhole shape but they are really not an issue. also, thanks for finding the top as it wasn't available at distribution center, went of your way!!
3 Snags very very easily.  i hadent even gotten to take the tags off and it rubbed against another item and snagged! so disappointed as it is a beautiful top, lovely color and beautifully detailed! i'm so disappointed i was hoping to keep it but will be sending it back.
3 I really wanted this dress to work out, but i was slightly disappointed in the fabric for the sleeves. the fit was accurate. i'm 5'7 and ordered a 6, however, my husband said it looked too little girl like. i did end up returning it :(
other This is a cute top with jeans for spring and summer, or warmer climates - very fresh and airy. the fabric hangs nicely and although it is lightweight, it is not too thin or see through. ii does not get overly wrinkled either. the style is flattering for most body types and it can be dressed up or down. the v neck is just right: not too deep that you feel like you are showing too much cleavage, but deep enough to be feminine and slimming. i normally wear a size s in retailer tops and blouses
other I got this sweater in navy and it is much cuter than online! it is a great transition sweater and also i can see it used on cool nights at the beach. i have worn in professional environment to work as well as with a tee and jeans. i love it!
other Dress is darling and well made. however, it runs very large. i tried to size down but then it became a little short in xsp. would be great for taller slim women. the style is so cute. the online picture does not do it justice.
other I ordered this in an 8p yellow. the yellow is more of a rich golden yellow than the easter yellow i see on my monitor that i was hoping it'd be, but i'm keeping it because it fits me perfectly. i am chesty for my size (32ddd), and somehow i don't look bigger than i am in this top. i also have broad shoulders and this doesn't feel tight when i move my arms. bonus that it has loops to keep your bra straps in place! i have to dock a star though because there are quite a few fabric threads to trim f
other I'm other ' 5" and 13other lbs., 34d and the size m is perfect. i will probably wear a thin, long cami under it as it is slightly see through. it doesn't gape under the arms like some sleeveless items...it fits smoothly. as the other review mentioned, it would be a perfect swim suit cover up. but i'm going to wear it more as a casual, very versatile, perfect for a hot day summer dress!
other These jeans have definitely made me an ag convert. the fit is perfection and at 5'3", it is so to buy jeans and simply wear them (without the typical extra 4-6" of length).
other I have never loved denim jackets because they always have seemed kind of basic or boring. this one is edgy and the design is amazing. it can be worn with anything and will go through many seasons. i found the fit to be on point. my normal medium fit perfectly.
other Like another reviewer mentioned, this shirt is way too short. i'm only 5'2" (xs) and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model. also, the quality isn't great as it's very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front. it's a shame b/c the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique. sadly, it's going back!
other I liked the design and i didn't mind that is see through, but i couldn't put it on ! not size 8 what is my usual size , not size 10 or 12, even 14! my shoulders wouldn't go through the middle part and it is not stretchy , so disappointed. i really wanted to like it.
other I really love how comfortable and versatile this dress is. the midi length is perfect for booties or flats, and the cowl neck is loose and fluid, so it lays well. the only complaint i had, and it's minor, is the tulip skirt doesn't stay closed well when i walk or sit, which reveals more inner thigh than i am comfortable showing. i have to be very mindful of the skirt all day (i teach high school).
other I love these pants! so comfortable and can be dressed up and dressed down! love them!
other Saw this top on-line and thought i would give it a try. i am glad i did. there is not a thing wrong with this top. cute design, nice weight fabric,(no cami needed underneath) and it fits very well. for reference i am 5' 1", 120lbs. and 35c. and of course it goes with literally every piece of clothing you would wear on the bottom half of your body!this is a keeper.
other This top is too short, so much so that tucking it in would be difficult. the designs are lovely, but the short length is putting this top back on the rack.
other Great little transitional piece. i bought the blk/blk floral one & it's not your usual top. sort of quirky & one of a kind looking. i think it's crazy comfortable & i just love it! even its a bit chilly outdoors, toss on a scarf round one's neck & head on out. not the kind of top you'd wear with a jacket.
3 I am 5' 7" with an athletic build (small chest, small waist, muscular hips/thighs). this shirt just hangs on me and makes me look much larger than i am. i purchased a small, an extra small would be way too short. i could see how it works for fuller figured girls.
other I got this dress in the gray, size small and it fits me perfectly. it hides flaws in your figure and is nice enough that it can be worn to the office and then out later for a date or dinner. i did not try on the white/black combo because i thought the white top part might be too sheer. unlike other reviewers, i think the contrast of fabrics works. i'm not sure why there are negative reviews here, i must have the right body type for it because i love it!
other Soft fabric and hangs nicely. washes well. purchased in the orange /red and love with jeans.
other This top is one of my retailer faves! it is so comfortable and love the quality and design. i receive many compliments on this top. i usually wear an xs or s in retailer tops and the xs was a little tight in the arms. the dressing room attendant suggested ordering a petite small so i wouldn't lose the shape. so glad i did. it fits perfect! i even ordered when it was on sale!! the gray color is perfect! its not too thick or thin.
3 This t is a beautiful color, and i wish it had worked. it is quite flimsy, however - very thin cotton fabric, without the nice drape that would have made this look good on. i also think it should have been cut a little longer; it flares out right at the hips,so instead of covering them, it highlights them. i'm disappointed, and am returning it.
other Very pretty fabric and beautiful color, but i agree with the other reviewer here, the fit is a bit strange. the waist is very small - need to size up at least one size for that to fit - while the rest fits nicely. it's also a little longer than i had expected...sort of looks like it should be a couple inches shorter (and i'm 5'11"!).
other Unfortunately the dress is pulling apart after the first wash ( gentle hand wash cycle). also, there are no bra-straps holders, and my bra straps did show up a lot...
other Goes with absolutely everything. it's very comfortable and versatile. can be dressed up or dressed down. great thing to have in the closet when you don't know what to wear!
other I got this sweater in white and i love it. the photo online doesn't do it justice, it's not frumpy at all and looks looks great zipped up because of the slanted zipper. my boyfriend calls it my claire underwood sweater.
other I tried this blouse on and loved the style, comfort and color of the peach so much that i was preparing to buy it. when i pulled the sleeve the fabric came away from the cuff. i tested another spot pulling only gently and the same thing happened. too bad since the color would have been a great addition for me. but--i also tried the blue and it gets other stars, as the fabric is much better. it too is adorable, soft and did not tear on gentle testing. the two blouse colors are made from different
other I purchased the purple motif in petite size small. it hits just the right length for me, but i can see that if i were any larger chested, it might be an issue. (for reference, i'm a 32d, 5'4, 112lb.) it's very forgiving on the tummy area, without looking bulky (other moms know what i'm talking about and understand my appreciation for this). the shirt is also a nice quality, really comfortable, and it's easy to wear with jeans, shorts, skirts, etc., making it a welcome versatile piece.
other It was very pretty,but it ran very big , sadly i had to return it.
other I usually wear 26 or 27 in pants, but i sized up to a 28p for these. the waist is a little big but better fit overall. i ended up buying them in the white also.
3 Cute design with interesting details. i felt it ran a bit large. i'm 5'8", 13other lbs, an 8 was too big and baggy. my biggest complaint with this skirt is the color. it's just not flattering.
other Very cute top. flowy and feminine. love that it has the little clips on the shoulders to attach to your bra strap to keep the sleeves from falling down.
other This top is cute! it adds a pop of color to my day and seems to be of high quality. the colors seem more vibrant in person and the material is quite soft and stretchy. as another reviewer pointed out, the peplum is only in the front! it sounds really weird but i don't really mind the look because i'll be wearing a jacket over it. i'm usually a size 12/1other with a 36dd bust and the large fits beautifully.
other The jeans look so different online! the pair i got did not have the stone washed look and was completely different cut. the rise is not as stated and is actually 10.other inches! also, i'm a true 2other and the waist is like a 27, but the legs are super skinny. i'm so disappointed and i'm not even sure if is worth swapping out for a smaller size. these look more like men's cut jeans.
other The texture, mixed yarn, and beading make for a lovely variation on the fairisle. as other reviewers have said, the length is not as long as it appears in the picture. the color is a very dark navy, almost black. the neck opening is larger than a standard crew sweater but lays mostly flat. the overall look is boxy. i'm 5'7 and normally wear a medium in retailer sweaters. i changed to a large so it would be longer and have a roomy drapy feel.
other This is a really cute shirt for spring. i love the colored striping and you can dress it up or down. have not worn it yet -- waiting for it to get a little warmer.
other This top is cute - nice fabric and design. pretty flattering for such a loose cut. my one concern though, was that when i was moving the peplum part kept riding up. i felt like i would constantly have to readjust the shirt to make sure it was lying flat. the shirt runs large. i'm usually a 6, and the other was plenty roomy.
other This is such a fun happy dress. i saw it in the store on the rack that has online returns so there was only one available to try on. it was a size other and i usually wear a 6 in retailer brands. i loved the dress and tried it anyway and it fit perfectly which is why i think it runs a bit large. ( for reference, i am 5'2" and 140 lbs., hourglass shape but a bit fluffy in the tummy and upper arms.) it has an empire waistline and a zipper in the back. it is so light and airy and super comfortable. it ha
other I picked this maxi up in navy to go with my summertime capsule wardrobe that i will be doing extensive travel with this summer. this dress is well made and fits my frame in a size m perfectly (5'4, 125lbs, 34c). it is substantial enough to disguise any backside indiscretions and the halter style front does not expose the girls. i do wear petals with this dress to ensure that i don't put on a show especially in air conditioned rooms. this launders easily and doesn't look rumpled and wilted after
other This is my favorite weekend jacket! it is so cute, soft and comfortable! the interior is an extra soft cotton that feels like my most favorite soft tee-shirt?? it is true to size. the best features are the versatility of the neck, pockets. and a little longer in the back - great over leggings/yoga pants. i ordered other sizes just in case the sizing was off - an xxs and xxs. i am a other petite and the xs is roomy enough for a sweater or sweatshirt under it. the xxs looked and felt great too and had a m
other This is festival dress epitomized. flowery, flowy, romantic styling. so many layers in a muted color pattern, but also retains heat since it's all polyester. good thing the skirt is swishy to air your legs out. my distress is regarding the length. petite was sold out so i bought the regular with the intention of wearing platform wedges. it's still too long! if i hem, i will lose a lot of the pretty blue pattern.
other I tried this dress on in the store and loved it. it's unfortunately out my price range but if i could have afforded it, i would have bought it. i'm about 5'10" and the length of the size other was perfect. sexy back and great color.
other It's very pretty. i purchased mine in the floral. romantic floral. the peplum is true to photos. it isn't short as many are. the print is gorgeous and the fabric is soft and comfortable and the styling is perfect
other I love this top! i think the knit rib quality is quite lovely and the color is gorgeous. i bought the plum color and got many compliments while wearing it. i like that it's a little on the longer side. i wore it with my pull-on ponte pants and booties. very cute!!
3 This is a lovely dress, but much more casual than i thought from the picture. the material is very thin and casual. i needed a dressier dress, and i didn't need another casual dress, so i sent it back, but it would be fine if you want something casual.
other I ordered size small and medium because i can go either way depending on brands. and both look great! there is no significant difference except medium fell about other inch longer. i am 5'4" and size small hem fell about 1" above knee. size medium felt tab bit more loose but i thought fabric may stretch a bit after wear so i'm keeping size small. what a beautiful dress! although the body of dress is jersey material, it is lined so there is good coverage. i tend to not like "faux leather" since they
other This is a wow dress as far as fit if you are a voluptuous or hourglass figure  woman. i have a 38inch bust and the medium fit perfectly...the whole dress fit perfectly. i'm so glad i took a risk and ordered it. i wish it was made from a better material like cotton versus polyester, but it has such a nice fit that i'll forgive the material choice.
other This looks great with the pilcro lace bottom white jeans. i bought the yellow and blue and it is flattering on. longer in the back. i love the style of the sleeves. very flattering style and fun, flirty and feminine. slightly see through. depending on your modesty level a nude bra may be just fine or else a nude cami. a really fresh look for summer. i do not think it looks cheap. i do think it is overpriced but i have a hard time finding tops that hit me at the right length in front and are not
other This dress is a marvel. it's flattering and cute. it is great for work, a date or just a casual day. and machine washable! best thing i've ever purchased from retailer.
other I specifically bought this dress for my bridal shower and loved it! i'm small on top and have hips that don't lie. i purchased the size other petite. the waist portion of the dress came up a little higher which was ok since it fell at a small part of my waist. the length was just above my knee, which i prefer. the dress has a nude lining which compliments my tan skin tone. i wore a regular nude bra that didn't show beneath the liner. i received many compliments and would highly recommend it. the
other The fit on this dress is super flattering! i am not normally able to wear a sheath but i felt great in this one. i am definitely a pear shape, bigger on the bottom than the top. one of the things i really love about this dress is that the size that fits me through the hips fits me on top. this is not often the case. i am not sure how this would work on someone with a large bust or an apple body type but i felt great in it. i also love the colors. i bought the green and blue. i have worn it once
3 It is a beautiful coat, runs small. arms feel tight, i am typically xs, i can't even button it up. bottom is skirted, and falls beautifully. it is light weight coat, not really fit for cold weather.
other I love these joggers. they are stylish, comfortable and high quality. my one complaint is that the sizing appears different for different colors. i got them in the green/moss color,. i immediately wore them casually with flats, a t, & a long silver necklace. that night, i literally just changed into a long, flowy silk cami and high suede black shoes with the joggers and wore them out- feeling comfy and pulled together (favorite combination). i loved them so much i decided to try the othe
other I built a new wardrobe around the three lovely velvet blazers: moss, copper and burgundy. they are soft, well-fitting, pretty linings and very satisfactory. this new version is stiff material, and ill-fitting. not coming in petite is a problem and it may fit others better, but it is too full across the front. with the stiff materials, this is a bad fit. disappointing and going back.
other I purchased this sweater in black to dress up my everyday cardigan. this is very soft and can dress up a skirt or great with jeans.
other This is a solid well made transistional dress going from late summer to fall. i'm 5'7" and got the medium and it falls a little above my knee. i could see it being very flattering on many body types. i do think you need to accessorize the dress as it is on the bland side. i bought the plum/brown color and am very happy with it.
other I am usually an xs but ordered an xxs in this because it looked like it ran large. glad i did. it's still roomy but doesn't look too big. could be a swim cover-up or would look cute with jeans. very pleased.
other I found this dress to be shapeless on (even when the belt was tied). i love the tshirt material and the fact it has short sleeves. it's just too boxy.
other I would not have spent this much on a dress without a gift card, but it absolutely lives up to the hype.
3 Love the shape of this top and often look to retailer for corset-style summer tops that are pretty. this top is made from a thick, stiff fabric that doesn't breathe. so my usual size xxs was too constricting. tried an xs also and it basically fit but i still wasn't a fan of the very heavy fabric in a summer top. it's almost like a neoprene. the colors are an odd choice and not my favorite either. i wanted to see in person and they just don't cut it for me. would love in different colors and softer
other I admit, i did not intend to buy a jean-dress but the cut - i could not pass it up. classic and vintage dress style. the fringy hem and more conservative length is so fun and makes the strapless top stand out. with a stunning necklace this will be a versatile piece. no doubt.
other Fun to wear inside sneakers or just around the house shoeless. my daughters tried to take them, but i held on to them.
other I just purchased this dress yesterday in the navy for my anniversary next month. i have to say its totally stunning on. the embroidery is beautiful, extremely figure flattering and the dress is very well constructed. i have to disagree with other reviews who say it doesn't or won't work for bustier women. i am a 3other d, 5'8" tall and normally wear a size 4. the other fits perfectly and the deep v-like neckline creates a very nice bit of cleavage. maybe too much for some at the office i would say, but
other I received tons of compliments on this dress. the print is fun and works well with the modest shape. i love the high neckline and the long hem. it's different and cool.my only complaint: the arm holes fall super low. i didn't realize until i looked at photos but my bra was very visible.
other I bought this dress because it looked sooo comfy. and it is! the fabric feels nice and it fits loose without feeling like a burlap sack. it's perfect for running around town for errands. i actually didn't think my boyfriend would like it because he generally likes more form-fitting pieces (yes, big surprise) but he actually commented out of the blue that it's really sexy. comfy *and* sexy?! score!
3 This top is beautiful, however it runs beyond big!i ordered my usual size and i could have fit other of me in this top.i am reordering and going other sizes down!the tie back and embroidery is beautiful.
other This top is fantastic. something about it has an ease of elegance and grace. the overall structure and design is aesthetically pleasing and easy to wear. i feel immediately put together and ready for anything. the fabric has great texture and flows well without feeling like the wind will carry you away. i purchased the off-white - it is a bit see-through, but i don't mind wearing a cami underneath.
3 Initially, i bought this because i liked the color and style of this trench coat. i thought it could look very chic and polished. the problem was it was too large and too wrinkly. i'm 5'other (11other lbs) and ordered an xs because petite sizes were unavailable. but i realize that a petite xs would've been a better fit. also the sleeves were too long even with an xs. i've already returned the product.
other This vest looks exactly as in pictures which is a good thing for online exclusives. i love the fact that it's lined and the texture and color of the fabric is very nice. has a good, solid quality feel to it. it does not have any buttons or belt that comes with it but looks perfectly fine just left opened. i wore it with belt as well and it add to the structured styling of the vest. more on the conservative side of retailer.
other I saw this online and didn't think twice about it but then i came across it at my local store and it's so much better in person! it is incredibly soft and cozy! i purchased the gray stripe version and two solid color versions (cream/forrest green.) i can see this being a great staple over the fall/winter with leggings, boots and a long pendant.
other I loved this skirt. the material is so fun and a love the pattern. unfortunately they didn't have the size i needed so it had to go back to the store
other I absolutely love this dress. the pattern is gorgeous and it is so comfortable. i have received many compliments every time i wear it. i will definitely start paying more attention to this brand when shopping retailer.
other The color of these shorts is even more beautiful and vibrant in real life. the detail is wonderful and they are so comfortable!
other This is the most unflattering peplum top i have ever tried on. fit perfectly as a size 6 should in the arms, shoulder, chest... then the waist was huge! just hung off of me like a flour sack. it was wider than the chest measurements, which made me appear frumpy instead of tailored and classic. combine that with the high-low hemline and it looked like a project runway reject. sent back immediately, do not buy this if you have (or want to appear to have) an hourglass figure, it will do nothing for
other I found this pretty sweater to run true to size. i am between a size large and extra large and the large fit well. it is perfect in the shoulders and body skimming without being too flared at the hem. the lavender is a dreamy light sky blue, true to what my monitor shows. i rarely wear anything but black and gray, but i could not resist this color. the sweater is a medium weight and i anticipate wearing this at the beach with white jeans and now with pale gray narrow wool pants. i really like th
other I just received the pink in the mail. i am 5' 5" and around 140. i ordered the size 29, they fit perfectly. they are a very straight leg with a snug fit. you can adjust the cuff to whatever length you need or unroll them completely. the fabric is of beautiful quality. i basically never wear corduroy because it can add pounds. not so with this pair of pants. i am thinking about another color!!
3 Its just ok. the bodice is fitted and this dress runs tts. it does have a little more poof on the skirt part of the dress than it looks on the model. at this point in my life when i buy a dress i have to say right away "i love it" and i just didn't. my husband looked and said it is just a "blah" color on me. so that maybe part of it. the fabric is nice, doesn't seem inexpensive and the lining is soft and falls nicely underneath the lace. i am 5'(" and the dress does fall exactly as it is shown o
other Wasn't sure what to expect but i like it. ordered size large and it's a perfect fit. the color is a blush beige. it falls at the top of my hips. i don't think you need a camo under it because the holes are small. it's a sweater type knit that's substantial but not heavy.  love that it ties at the shoulder to adjust the fit and length.
other One of the most beautiful sweaters i've ever seen. i love it!
other I ordered this cutie before i read any reviews and i am so glad i did. mine does not have any weird smell at all. i ordered a medium and i wear a size 8. it fits perfectly and is long enough to wear with leggings ...with coverage. the detailing on the yoke is so pretty. i bought it with a discount promotion so it made the price better. i am really glad to add it to my wardrobe!!
other I'm calling this the "gateway jumpsuit" for all those ladies who are wondering about this whole jumpsuit trend and how they feel about it--you know who you are. this jumper is flattering, comfortable, elevated--and worth trying on! i'm petite but long-waisted with curves on the bottom, which can be a tough combo when trying to find a jumper. i actually ordered the petite other first, which was better fitting in the waist area but i ended up ultimately purchasing the regular other since i preferred where
other I am hippie and always worry about coverage. this was a nice fit, good coverage but did not look old-ladyish.
other I bought this skirt in the store a few months ago, because i anticipated that retailer would sell out of my size considering how great the fit/look of this skirt is. sure enough, they've sold out of the size 2. normally i wear a size 4, sometimes 6, in skirts depending on the cut and where it's from; just last year i bought a skirt from retailer in a size 10! for me, this was a skirt i needed to try on to get the perfect size, but it's absolutely adorable and a great deal at the sale price! it's mod
other Really great tank. fit runs a little small if you are tall.
3 I order this shirt because it looked like a shirt you could dress up or down. when i got it the shirt was really wrinkled. therefore, i knew it would have to ironed a lot. it was quite boxy and was shorter in the front then in the back. i didn't realize that this shirt was two different fabrics. overall i think this shirt would be more flattering on a woman that was petite.
other Love all pilcro, this is no exception. very flattering. slim fit but not skin tight. comfy!
other Just bought red today to wear to a conference to stay warm over floreat peasant blouse and pilcro serif jeans. love love!! very flattering and plan to wear with skirts, on airplanes for warmth and for travel. very versatile . highly recommend .
other I originally bought the white lace version of this dress, but it felt too "bridey?" then i snagged all three of the velvet blazers and spotted this black version. i like that it is not all lace, with the pleated chiffon "center." the under slip is straight and fits with the outer layer sheer enough to give the appearance of there being a shape under the flow. it is so versatile as i can do it with the velvet blazers and booties or classic lbd with black pumps. well worth the price as this will f
other Very soft, first thing i have to say, but runs a little big, especially in the sleeves, i ordered the xxs p and the sleeves still bunch a lot at the wrists. also, other bummer is how sheer the ivory fabric is, i wish it had more substance for the price. but, i like the style and color combo. classic look, effortless, and can be paired with so many things. the regular size neckline was too low for me. the length on the petite was fine, not too short. so i say it runs big.for reference, i am 1
other I was on the fence about this dress - i wanted something nice but casual for a family graduation. i'm glad i took the chance once it went on sale! the fabric is not as thick as you'd expect for a "sweater." just thick enough to hide any imperfections, panty lines, etc. i plan to layer with long sleeved tees or a jean jacket. i think it will do great through fall with tights and a turtleneck.i'm 5'6', 13other lbs, 34b and the small fit perfectly. i am "pear - shaped" by conventional standards, bu
other I ordered a size xl. it's flowy so it could be running larger but since the fit in the shoulders/neck/sleeves matches the model, i think it's true-to-size for the design. it is so comfortable. i love the softness of the material. the problem for me is the color. on my monitor, it looks like a light ivory or white. but, the embroidered lace bib portion is a darker ivory shade that doesn't work for my complexion so i'll be returning mine. everything is well-made though, especially the vintage-styl
other I love this dress, but have found that this brand runs large. i'd order a size down.
other This versatile tunic is a mini dress on me (5'3" 36dd) when i wear size l and warm sweater when i wear size m. i love the boxy yet flattering cut, the cute neckline and the warm smooth knit fabric. wish i had gotten my hands on the cream colorway!
other Purchased this in two colors online. purchased in an xs - i am usually a s or xs. the fit was really large in the xs and the seam on the front of the top was in the wrong place and was really unflattering. returning both.
other I tried this blouse on in the store. i'm generally an 8 or 10 in this brand. i got down to a size other and gave up. this blouse is huge all the way around. the detail on the blouse is pretty, but the tent like cut made it impossible for me to buy it. i know retailers blouses can be swingy and flows but this went way beyond. perhaps on a tall person the swing would work but on a short person like myself...i looked ridiculous.
3 These are a wonderful trouser style pant. i love fitted than flared denim so this fit isn't my top pick but it's a cute style! thick quality denim fabric with a medium rise cut.
other The skirt is a little longer than i expected, it hits me at my calf, i considered having it shorten knee length but believe that may takeaway some of the aesthetic so i'm going to wear it as it. the quality is quite nice and the color is lovely, very feminine. nice skirt for a picnic
other These feel so soft and amazing. i especially love that the length work for me, just a tiny bit long and i am 5'4. i did find that they ran smaller than my pilcro and other jeans.
other Love this dressed up casual tshirt. perfect casual friday shirt or going out for happy hour with the girls.
other Picked this up end of season sale, but i go to florida a lot so i will still be able to use it. it runs a bit large. i'm usually between a s and m at retailer and i'm a bit heavy right now but the small fit loose and comfortably. i would recommend sizing down if you are between sizes. not itchy but i would wear a cami underneath because it is white and could start to itch after a while i suppose. it's definitely not a soft flowy t. mix of t-shirt material and linen. the main part of the t is cotto
other I really wanted to like this dress. the material, design, length and fit all over was perfect, except for the armholes- too big and the ruffles came right upto the nipple line. not comfortable with that. sadly, had to return.
other Received this jacket today and i am so very impressed with the details. initially when i ordered this jacket i first thought the navy blue waffle fabric was a corduroy or velvet, but it is a plain cotton blended fabric with unfinished edges that has the denim attached to it. the plus is the inside breast pocket that is trimmed so nicely and lined, and fits a nice sized phone. the inside is lined and even the sleeves are lined . there is pretty cream lace trim on the inside bottom of the lining i
other Haven't worn it yet, but i am loving this top. it is much prettier in person. i sized up to a med based on reviews and it looks like it runs small. i didn't try it on until i got home and probably could have done ok in a small but will keep the medium so it's not tight across my chest. the knit material that makes up the arms and back is thin, which is my only complaint. if it was slightly thicker it would look nicer and i'm sure wear longer. i'm happy with my purchase-the colors, fabric, embroi
other Ok, so by now, we know this is a cute top that is basically true to size but a little clingy. i prefer to wear it with a tank top or tee shirt underneath. it would also do well layered under something. for refernce, i am 5'7, about 120, and xs was the best fit.but what i really wanted to mention is that i washed it in the machine on cold delicate and dried it on low, and it survived just fine!
other I'm in love with these leggings. they are super soft and comfortable. they look cute on and are great for working out or even running errands. very stylish too!
other This is a very pretty blouse with a vintage, romantic looking fabric. the tiny pleats near the neck and shoulders are lovely. i love the colors...black, brown, and cream. it's hard to find a top that can be worn well with both black and brown. the long tie adds a romantic feel. this blouse is totally sheer so requires a cami or tank. i actually love the blouse, but returned it because it is super blousy. i am 5'2", 140 lbs., and the small was fine. it is just so blousy, that even belting it didn
other I love the print and style of the skirt. it is very cute and feminine and can easily be worn into autumn. the downside is that the elastic waist is a little too loose and needs to be tighten. also, the is a lot of extra fabric in the skirt and makes it look so much larger than it is and it runs about 3 inches longer. for reference, i'm 5'5, 3other 2other 3other and the xs is loose in the waist. still, i really love the skirt and plan on keeping it and having it altered.
other Cute summer/vacation dress. lightweight material but not flimsy. i'm normally a xs/s and i ordered the s petite which was right b/c i think the xs would have been too clingy looking. the regular length would also have been too long.
other These "jeans" definitely look more like pants and are very snug, but stretchy. i'm 5'10 and ordered the tall, and mine are a little longer than shown on the model. they look nice on, but are a tad tighter than i anticipated.
3 This blouse is a beautiful color and i love the dot design and texture. however, it is a much baggier fit than i expected based on the photo, and it looks a little bit like a maternity shirt on me. i usually wear a size 8 or 10 and i bought a size medium.
other I really love the fit of this classic scoop neck tee. i am 5'8", 140 lbs, and 3other a/b. i am typically a size xs/s or 2/other in all retailer tops. however, this brand (velvet) runs small. i had to order a size medium. the fit is slim to your body and is a little sexy with the low scoop neck! the fabric is very soft and a little thin. i am a little concerned how it is going to wash, it seems a little delicate. but i will wash it on the delicate cycle and line dry it. i ordered the black (classic
other I love workout dresses and skirts. i sport them in both yoga (if they have an under layer of shorts, obviously) and in high cardio classes-as well as for things like tennis. i like the extra breeze a dress/skirt will get you, and find them to be really comfortable. i really like this dress as it is not a super bold color (it is hard to find workout attire that is not neon colored). i prefer things to be a little more relaxed and less "look at me" like when i am working out. this dress is flatter
other I received this product and love the color and sheen of it. it is not too flashy, and would work great as a dress to an event day or night with the right accessories. i am about 5'7 and 11other lbs, and usually wear a size 0 in dresses. the size 0 fit, but was a little loose. if they had a 00 it probably would have been too small though. you definitely cannot bend over in this dress because it is too short, but i didn't feel it was inappropriately short otherwise. it flares out just slightly on the
other Bummer, i fell in absolute love with these gems until i realized how weak the stretch is by the end of the day. i purchased them on the 13th of feb and can't bare to wear them anymore.
other I'm usually a 2-other in retailer dresses and i was surprised how well the other fit. i like that the dress is navy instead of black, which makes it even prettier.the embroidery is very nice without being too much to wear for more casual activities. fabric is thick enough for wearing out in autumn with some tights and a sweater. prettier in person.
other A classy t-shirt - can go from work to casual.the gray and mauve were both drab in color and hard to pair with neutral dress pants.i chose the white. it definitely runs large, so size down (i.e. wear m/l, chose s).the fabric is linen, very itch, so tank is probably needed underneath.flattering fit for curvy figure.
other When i first saw this in the store, i loved the idea of this shirtdress with a twist. i tried it on in my usual size other but could not get it over my 32d bust. i wrote it off and moved on. back in the store shopping for a party dress, i saw this was now on sale. although not right for the party, i decided to try it in a bigger size. a size 6 was not available but a size 8 was. perfection! if you are willing to size up, you will be rewarded with a comfortable, versatile dress that can be super casu
other This dress is amazing quality with stunning details. its flowy and absolutely beautiful.i plan on wearing it whilst im in the depths of the mongolian mountains while singing operatic arias.i ordered a size two regular, even though i am petite for the sole purpose of dress length.---->in the picture, the dress comes down to an awkward length on the model, the sleeves are 3/other and it doesnt look as good as it could if the length settled down to where their ankles are, or if the sleeves reache
3 I saw this dress in the store and absolutely fell in love with the fabric and just had to have it. i ordered it on line in my size and when it arrived, i tried it on (or tried to try it on) and it didn't fit some parts of my bday (mainly in the bust). i ordered the largest size, so there was no where to go from there except to send it back. others here have complained about a strange fit in the tummy area (i.e., too much material). i never got to find out because i really couldn't get the dress
other Love this top - it's flattering and perfect for a casual dinner out or running around on a saturday afternoon. super comfortable and very cute.
other I followed everyone's advice in the reviews and ordered up one size. i have a 3other inch waist, but size 10's (and 30's in pilcro hyphens) usually fit me. i ordered the 1other in this skirt, and it fits perfect. it's form fitting at waist and hips and then flares out, but i'm curvy. if you are straighter, it will be looser around the hips. i love the length. it hits me mid calf, so a bit lower than it does on the model. i'm 5'5" tall. the fabric is soft, but has no stretch. it's 100% cotton. there is a
other When i tried it on, it was a bit shapeless, but it was on a promo so i decided to get it. i kind off like shapeless. i've worn it three times and washed it gently in the machine as recommended (in a lingerie bag, always) and air dried it. it now has a huge rip on the sleeve seam, and i cannot see how this happened. the inner lining is soft and substantial  but the outer gauze layer is thin.
other Got this in wine, very pretty and soft. but so sheer, even with the dark color one would have to wear a cami. returning for this reason. having to wear a cami wrecks the otw ultra-comfort.
other I wanted this dress in the turquoise motif, but it sold out so quickly! i tried on about 10 dresses in my local store and this was the clear winner. i got the blue and white motif, which has enough visual interest with the way the pattern flows across the dress. i found the dress to be slimming and very comfortable. you can throw it on and not think about flashing anything when you bend over, or the skirt flying up in the breeze, or needing a strapless bra. the skirt flows really nicely and over
other This is an adorable top, but it just wasn't my style. i'm 40 and felt silly wearing a big bow, but if you can rock this look i'd recommend it. the top is a thin sweatshirt material, not a knit sweater or a thick sweatshirt fabric. it is a cotton rayon blend. the sweatshirt part is cropped, but the striped shirt details come to a good length. the shirt trim is 100% cotton. the fit was true to size. it is a bit loose, not overly fitted, but true to size. it nips in a bit at the waist and then flar
other If you've been an retailer lover for awhile, you have at least one of the left of center thermals. every single year they come out with them and they are best sellers - so when i saw this is couldn't believe it!!! it's just like the left of center thermal shirt, but a cardigan! soft, warm but thin enough that it would be a perfect layer for the summer. be warned that this fabric does grow with wear. definitely size down a bit. the body is full and the sleeves are fitted. lots of stretch and very v
other Warm, asthetically pleasing and super comfy. i love the combination of style and comfort together. this sweater is a must have.
3 I am a proportionate 5'4" 39 year old and thought this dress would look great. it's a-line and looks a lot like the kind of dresses that usually fit me nicely. i bought it in an 8p, which is my normal size. the hips were a little too big, but not bad. the top part, however, was enormous. the cut in the shoulders/neckline was way too wide, the lace sleeves were way too big, there was too much room in the bust (my c cup was inadequate), etc. this dress would look nice on someone who is thicker/vol
other This top is an amazing go to piece, and yes i have all the colors i could grab my hands onto. i will say, that under the arms small little balls of fabric begin to appear with wear. therefore, it will need a quick once over with your sweater shaver from time to time. good staple for a great price.
other It is very comfortable and the fabric is amazing. it runs a little short on me because i have a long torso, but it works great with a tank underneath. love it!
other Sexy, yet sweet and demure? all points checked with cute little number. this is the third byron dress i've bought and like the melodist, i purchased the 8p and had the same issue--too loose in the hips
other Love this top. very flattering on an hour glass figure because even though it has a more of an empire waist it is not so volumous as to overwhelm the figure --as so many retailer tops are these days. one caution: i had to go up a size to accommodate my bust.  normally a size 6 or small in retailer tops but a 34dd, so went up to a size 8.  the top is more snug around the bustline so just be warned if you are well endowed.  the fabric is sheer but not overly so, embroidery is well done. over all a b
other I said this ran large because i bought a 16 and i normally need a size 18 (i'm busty) if the item doesn't stretch. but, a size 16 fit me. it's more straight and less blousy, but it does fit. so, if you like your tops a little less full of fabric and more tailored but loose, imho you can size down.the fabric is rayon/polyester that's light and cool. it is semi-sheer but a white bra or nude bra would be fine. the top has a double layer in front. one solid and the over-lay of the embroidery. th
other Very flattering suit. runs large. i stumbled into this in my local store. must have been a return. i tried it on even though it was a size small not my usual medium. fit like a glove!! covered my 36c chest. i have tried many suits and this is best on my curvy shape. flattering to tummy. i am 5'6" 127lb.  not very toned at 59 years of age. this suit is amazing. highly recommend!!!!
other I've been waiting for this to go on sale, and just picked one up in store. the details and style of this blouse do not disappoint! since it's billowy in nature, a size smaller fits me perfectly.
other I love this sweater - i've gotten compliments on it every time i've worn it! i have the moth color and it is oh so cozy, yet not too big or too heavy. i pair it with black leggings, black booties and a crimson-colored scarf. it's nice as it can be great for day-to-evening. getting the other two colors asap! the medium fits me perfectly.
other Found this jumpsuit in standard size small/red motif (pictures don't do it justice) in-store and to my surprise, it actually fit! of course, it was billowy since i'm short/ 113lbs., and it came all the way down to the bottom of my ankles where they meet my feet, which i don't mind. i love that it almost looks like a maxi dress when on. the smocked bodice was snug for a size small so there is a little bit of skin bubbling out in the chest area/near my armpits..like normal women usually have. ladi
other This is such a perfect tee to wear on cold days! it's a fall/winter/spring staple for sure. it's very soft and falls perfectly. i would definitely recommend it.
other These pants fit the bill! they're soft and very comfortable. easy to wear day and night. these are a little higher on the waist, which i love. purchased two pair! i purchased the regular and they come to my ankles.
3 Tried this dress on today in the store. i am a size 10, sometimes a size 8. the size 1other was the first size i tried that zipped all the way up. however it was still very tight around my stomach and bust. and then from having to size up, it flared out too much at the bottom for my liking
other Fits just like on the model, even though im 5'4''. really happy with this casual summer find.
other This is really a lovely top, but the color online is not quite what the color actually is in person. this was a find in my store today and it is a little more lilac than the picture shows. the cut is extremely flattering and the fabric is very soft as is the case with most one september items. the one recommendation that i have for this is that because the main fabric is a soft knit, the proper undergarments are really needed. i tried it with a lace bra and you could see a lot the details of the
other This is a great dress that i wear to work, but would also wear to a cocktail party or wedding. it rides up a tiny but, but is long enough that i feel completely comfortable. it is tiny up top so i'd recommend ordering up if you have any chest - i'm 5'4", 100lbs, bra size 32b and it was a two-person job to get the bodice zipped.
other This top was different than what i normally wear but based on good reviews i purchased. i really love it. it is different than i thought it would be. i thought it was longer sleeves but it is just above the elbow. definitely need a tank or something underneath as it is see through and the sleeve holes are quite large. definitely recommend.
other I'm in love with this jumpsuit! i'm 39 y/old, 5.5", 140lbs and ordered the 6 petite (my legs are a little challenged in the length department). it fits perfectly, and i get complimented every time i wear it. simple, yet elegant and stylish.
other The model looks awesome in this cute top, but on me it looked boxy but was too tight around the chest and was too short (for reference, i'm 5'7," 140 lbs., and 34c). the front is non-stretchy eyelet lace cotton fabric, yet the back is stretchy. in theory, it's pretty, but in reality it doesn't work - at least for me. i think it might work for someone petite with a smaller chest.
other What a beautiful flowing top. i am either a large or xl in tops but only needed a large in this top. i purchased it in the neutral color, but will probably get it in plum. if you have some flaws in your middle, this conceals everything. the material is so soft. you can dress it up or down and wear it from now until late fall. the plum color was beautiful, but i have more to wear with neutral. a great, versatile top.
other I really loved this dress in the store when i tried it on the color and fabric were perfect for summer but once i got this home i noticed the placket wouldn't lay flat across the bust like shown in pictures. when i went up a size it was too large under the arms so this one will sadly have to go back to the store.
3 They were too small for me. i loved them other than that.
other This is the perfect throw on little blazer-like jacket that feels like a sweatshirt! i loved it so much (on sale) that i bought another one in a different color. i am 5'0'' and 115lbs and the xs fits like a glove. it is so great. well made. so comfortable. versatile. dress it up for work or down with a pair of jeans.
other Loved it online for its modern cut and print. however, when i received the item i was disappointed. i ordered my usual size other and i was swimming in it. i like oversized things and understand that this dress is made that way; however, this was not flattering. i would say i would have needed to size down to a 0 and perhaps it would work but i didn't want to take another chance. the material seemed almost crepey, which i wasn't neccissarily expecting either. bummer that it didn't work out.
other These jammie pants are quite beautiful and comfortable. the material used is great, very light and thin. i found these to run really big though, definitely order a size down!!
other I took a risk on this one. i wasn't sure if the shirt was more green or more blue. i look better in blue. it turns out that the shirt is a bit more green, but i think it still looks good! i'm 5'3' and 12other lbs. i got a medium. i could have maybe gotten a small, but i like the medium. the shirt has a bit of a vintage look to it, which i like. all in all good.
other Nice design but very wrinkly fabric that doesn't fall well. also, as has happened to me before, retailer sent me a dress clearly worn/used and returned by someone else with hair all over it. you would think they would at least look at returned dresses to make sure that the returned clothes were free of stains and hair before they send them out.
other This is the first maxi i purchased this summer. i went with a petite as the regular length would need to be altered and i didn't want to lose some of the pattern on the bottom. it is a beautiful flowy dress. no need for a slip. it has beads on the bodice. i kept the dress but it is tight at the chest area and sizing up wouldn't have made that much of a difference..kinda uncomfortable in the chest area. has yet to be worn so may return..
other If your looking for a nice quality basic tee, this is it. nothing special, but the fabric is a nice soft cotton with a little stretch. the cut is long and lean so i would highly recommend sizing up. i sized up from my usual medium to a large and it's still quite form fitting. i'm 5'2", 35a/b bust, 28 waist, 39 hips.
other Cute design, the fabric drapes well, conceals many possible figure flaws, and has an upbeat, easy vibe. i got a small and am 12other lbs and 5'4". i also washed it on a short cycle on cold and put it in the dryer for other minutes, which worked out just fine. great dress!
other This dress had beautiful details, and the material was better than i expected; however, it was huge! it completed swallowed me. i am 5'other about 106 pounds with quite a bit of muscle. i ordered a 00p and it still looked like a sack.
other Falls beautifully and the color is vibrant. can be dressed up or worn casually. texture adds even more uniqueness. a little heavy but this is outweighed by its other lovely features.
other I love this dress. it's adorable and great for summer with a unique style- it's a bit unusual with the high and slightly ruffled neck. it can easily be dressed up or worn more casually. this is the most flattering dress i've found this season (particularly around the stomach area). i'm 5"3' and took a petite size, which fit perfectly. this dress is a bit translucent, so skin-toned undergarments are a must.
3 Beautiful top, the silk was good quality, not thin. ordered a 6 because it was selling out so quickly, wished i could have ordered the 4. will definitely try if they come back in stock.
other I bought this top in the wine color. i just love it. as soon as i wore it i received compliments because it has so many unique details. i bought a medium and it was just the right size.
other This sweater has the weirdest stitching, although the buttons on the sleeves are a nice touch and the hunter green color is to die...poor fit means poor sweater :)
3 This dress has so much potential- loved the pattern and the neckline. however, only one side of the waist was gathered with a fake sash leaving the other side plain. the gathered side was super flattering while the other side showed any little lump or bump. needless to say, i'm returning it.
other This jacket is beautiful! the embroidery is very well done! the jacket is fully lined in black. i usually wear a l/xl and definitely needed the xl as it runs a little small.
3 These pants are lovely and comfortable, but they are entirely too delicate. i wore them once and nearly any time something touched them, they snagged. i was worried about it when i saw the fabric, and thought i'd give it a try, but i didn't think it would be this bad. for the price, i expect better quality. also, they run a little large- unless i pull the waist down low, it gaps in the back and these look better worn a little bit higher, closer to the natural waist. i'm usually a 4/6, 28/29 in b
other For reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40.
other This top fits great. maybe a tad on the large side but not enough to go down a size. i love the fit. the bell sleeves and peplum are so flattering. definitely worth the price too!
other I have to return this top. the armholes are huge. the material is on the thin side and not what i expected. i can't size down. i got an xxs. maybe if i had been able to order a petite, it would have fit better. i ordered the red and i liked the color.
other Not what i was expecting, but pleasantly surprised.  was envisioning a more structured/tailored trouser, but these are closer to leggings, albeit very substantial ones with "real pant" touches like a zip/button front and (faux) pockets.  they're form fitting, soft yet supportive, stretchy, incredibly comfortable, and tts.  i'm a pretty legit 10 in pants (30/31), and the 10's near perfect, with the rise coming right to my belly button.  think i'll grab another pair now while they're available.
other So glad i bought this!! its beautiful and being on sale made it even better. good quality and versatile, highly recommend.
other I was really excited to get this dress, i initially ordered a small (i am a size 4) but when i tried it on, it was really tight. the bodice at the top fit strangely-i had to shorten the straps quite a bit, and the dress just looked off. i love retailer and get all of my dresses from there, and the look of the dress on line was beautiful, but just didn't fit right. i did love the lace look, and would love seeing more dresses with this design.
other I got this piece because it was so unique.. that's one of the things i love so much about retailer: not afraid to go where no woman has gone before, so i ordered it in a 4p, my usual size, and a 4. i am petite, but the other worked perfectly, i think. i am pretty voluptuous below the waist and medium to small on the top and the 4p was too small all over - so i would agree that it runs small.the quality is excellent, the look is great. my husband liked it on me. it might work for the office with so
other Love this top! you can definitely wear this out with jeans or with dress pants for work. it can be dressed up or down, so it's very versatile. the red motif is a gorgeous color for spring and summer. received lots of compliments!
3 I was so excited about this top, super cute and fit perfectly but as soon as i washed it (cold, hand wash, air dry) it shrunk! now it is too short and tight. i did not expect the material to shrink so very disappointed.
other This blouse was so cute, i really wanted to love it. as others mentioned, there is something wrong with the fit. i'm not a large person, but the top was tight even though i ordered a medium and a small.
other The buttons on the side give this top style. great color and fabric make it perfect paired with denim.
other I had my eye on this for a while and finally picked it up on sale. i got the darker blue in xs. great piece, fits well. very cozy but the cuffs add such cute detail.
other I absolutely love this top.....the color, style, fit..everything! i took another reviewers advice and sized down from my normal large to a medium. i have had so many compliments wearing this top. it is very feminine, flows nicely, hangs well. love the color. can't recommend this enough!
other I wanted to love these jeans, but as a woman who is almost 4other there was way too much stretch in them. i am always a size 26 and i couldn't wear these, they were way too tight! they went back the next day. i will say, it could be my body type, i"m a runner so my legs are muscular. if you have very thin legs, these could be great and work for you. i loved the color, dark blue.
other Lucky enough to have the chance to try this on in the store! the sleeves are not big
other I splurged on this dress (still a bit pricey, even on sale), but so far it's the best purchase i've made all summer. the terry is a somewhat unusual choice for a dress that otherwise would have been on the fancier side, but it makes it sooooo comfortable--it's even more breathable and lightweight than the super thin cotton sundresses that usually dominate the summer. my only real complaint is that the cut is a bit out of whack. the medium just barely fits my hips, but it's pretty loose on top--y
other This dress is the best of all worlds: sophisticated, modern, and flattering. i was surprised that the "dress" is actually two separate pieces: a navy blue slip and a bold magenta lace overlay, which will be perfect going into fall and the holiday season. i had two babies back-to-back and am not back to my pre-baby shape, but i was pleased to see how flattering this dress was. i will be wearing it to a wedding in a couple of weeks, and i know i will feel comfortable and confident in it.
other I wanted to love this, but instead of being a flowy kimono top as pictured- it was a thick blazer type garment. not at all what is pictured here unfortunately. also it was much shorter than pictured and i am only 5'4''. love most retailer styles, but this one was a miss and a return.
other I was undecided whether to get regular or petite. i am 5'4" but i didn't want it to be sloppy long. ordered the petite xs as other reviewers suggested ordering down and its perfect. length falls on me same as the model above. not heavy and very soft. casual but not sloppy. sleeves are a tad long which i prefer.
3 This style is very pretty and flattering. i love the flow of the material and the open shoulders are nice for the design
other I love this dress! great fit and quality. love that the skirt is lined. this is a real throw on and go piece. i've worn it with wedges and with espadrille sneakers. my only complaint is that the sturdy material makes it difficult to get the tie waist to lay down flat. but overall an amazing dress!
other A comfortable shirt that has a touch of dressy to it.
other Loved this dress! material is soft... the overall fit is great! the challenge with this dress is the side slits... they do go pretty high... too high for church but may wear them with leggings as it gets cooler... super cute with or without belt 5'9 13other lbs and i ordered a small.
other This is a great jacket. my only issue is sleeves are way to long and had to have them shortened. this upped my price by 45.00. oh well, its still what i wanted!
other I ordered a regular size xs and the length is still fine for me at 5'2". i love the color and the fabric is super soft and comfortable. i'll get a lot of use out of it this summer and the sale price is a great bargain!
other I'm so glad i trusted my instincts and decided not to size down on this luxurious dress since my body type is so different from the previous reviewers.  size small would have surely cut off my circulation around my shoulders.  i bought mp since i have thick arms/shoulders/back and i'm short 135# 38-27-35.   my only gripe is how skinny and insubstantial the straps are so maybe i'll get those changed.  i'm tempted to buy the other color since this dress is so beautiful but i really don't nred it!
other I worse this dress to a rehersal dinner and received so many compliments. it was a perfect summer dress.. the colors are true to the picture and beautifil. it is also very well made, comfortable and flattering. i am 5'3' and 130 lbs and i ordered a medium petitte which fit great. it was short but not too short! it will be a go-to dress!
other Beautiful jacket and i got lots of compliments. true to size. it's not thick but it's very warm.
other I love this top. the seam does go across the bustling but if you are small chested like me...it is perfect. very bohemian and an almost classic look with a very contemporary twist. there are splits up the side that show off a great pair of leggings. i wore this today with some lysee black and grey patterned leggings, a long grey camisole, and some cute short free people booties...i may have gotten 20 compliments. love it.
other I noticed half of the reviews on here were from women with a slim/straight and/or petite figure. fit-and-flare dresses simply will not work for you; it's the entire purpose behind the "flare" shape at the hip. it will be too large for women without wider hips.-------------------------that said, i found this perfect for me in every way. after having a baby, it's hard to find a dress that fits my more curvy shape where most of my weight fell on the hips and bust. i wish this dress was a tad long
3 This would have been a perfect jacket for a trip i'm taking, light weight and very stylish. however the jacket runs huge, the arms are long but it was the shoulders that were too big. i wear a size 8-10 mostly 10 in retailer clothes i ordered the large and the shoulder seam was about 2? past my natural shoulders. i won't return for a smaller size because the fabric being wool (i should have checked) its unbearably itchy esp around the neck, you could wear a long sleeve top and a scarf but then it
other If you're a little afraid to rock a jumpsuit this one's for you. the palazzo leg makes it look a lot like a dress. a light shelf bra was very supportive even for my d/dd cup. it does run large. i'm typically a 14/16 and was easily able to fit in the 12, although the look it a bit racier on me due to cleavage. hides any tummy you might have very well due to the flowing cut. the fabric is light and comfortable. my only complaint is i wish it was a tad longer. i can not wait to rock this at a weddi
other I bought these and returned them almost immediately. the material looks nice, but itchy and heavy. the fit is too small and just uncomfortable to wear.
other Great pair of work slacks with a flare. wear these with boots give a very rich look. super flattering cut and flat waist.highly recommend these for fall through winter!
other I am a 10 m and got the 10. it fits perfectly and there is room in the bust (i'm 36/38 c). the shirt feels very nice and silky up to the skin. i'm just not sure about the print- i got the umbrellas. it's cute, but maybe a little too cartoonish? it does look good with a green or blue puffy vest for colder days...still trying to decide if i should keep or return, but only b/c of the print. i'd love this in some solid colors!
other I can never resist a peter pan collar, so i bought this top in the ivory. it's so cute! i wore it for the first time today and received many compliments. it's very comfortable, fits well, and looks expensive. highly recommend it!
3 I ordered this sweater in xxsp and the sweater is still very large on me. it is definitely a sweater that is supposed to hang off of your shoulders, however, i'm finding that it wants to fall all the way off of me. the quality is nice. it is medium in weight. it has a cottony feeling, but it not super soft. it looks way better on the model shown than in person to me. i wanted to love it, but i only just like it. i think others will like this if you are looking for a fun, loose look in a sweater.
other This is a very flattering / soft sweater. the pockets make it so much cuter & do not make me look "thick". highly recommend!
other Although this isn't a soft top, i didn't find it that scratchy or bothersome at all. it's 55% linen! and, for linen it's soft. it's also got tons of stretch which makes it very comfortable as far as movement. i bought the black, and i do not find this sheer or see-thru. it's a light thickness which makes it perfect for layering under a jacket or sweater for a cool spring or warm fall day. i found it running tts, with the sleeves and length a little long (i'm petite) making perfect for the av
3 I saw this in my local retailer store and thought it was super cute. tried it on and was delighted. the top fits nice and looks crisp and nice - a great nautical look. the brass buttons add a pop to the shirt that is very nice. i usually wear between a medium and large in retailer shirts and the large fit perfectly. i am a 34d for reference and usually a size 1other on top. i bought the top and didn't notice until i got home that it is dry clean only! yikes. i hate that. this is a casual top to me.
other Fits well. true to size. love the kelly green color and found a blouse to match. the see-through part gives it some oomph and a little extra sexiness without being inappropriate for work. only downside is the beige color--kind of a funky bandaid-colored beige. but the blue and the green balance it out.
3 The material feels substantial and decent. however the diameter of the opening for arm is too big, it exposes good chunk of my bra. have to return it. there're also loose fiber of the fabrics, not sure if it is because it's new.
other Very comfortable and soft. i wish the neck was a bit lower and it runs on the large side. i am 5'7" wear a 10/12, i ordered the l and it was very big on me, will try it in the m, though i'm worried that it will be too high in the waist on me.
other I saw this and had to have it!  it is so beautiful.  it has pops of color that can be paired with so many options.  i like the uniqueness of the flowers being on the backside.  it is thinner fabric, so i will have to wear a black cami underneath but i have no problem with that.  especially, going into cooler weather anyway.  it is very flattering on.  this one will go fast.  thank you retailer!
other The fabric and color are absolutely beautiful. the shape of the dress is strange - fitted and tight through the waist, and enormous everywhere else. it was not flattering.
other I am petite and so ordered this top in a petite size and found that it ran large. i am also pretty busty to boot, but found there was more than enough room. the length was still a bit long for me, however it does hit on my where it does on the model. the top is wonderful quality, thick and not see through at all. i am almost tempted to get a regular size and try to wear it as a dress.
other Finally a top that fits true to size, is comfortable, and is the quality i expect when shopping at retailer. i cannot recommend this top more! if it came in other color motifs i would buy them too. perfect fall transition top.
other This is one of those just throw on and go dresses that i love. it is breezy and easy, comfortable, but also polished and lovely with some really nice design features and a beautiful mixed print. you can wear it with some cute flip-flops, or polish it up with some cute boots.
other I love this jess. i got it in the blue gray color, and i think it's going to be great for spring and will work into summer as well. cloth and stone is always one of my favorite brands and this dress is so soft. i'm thinking that i'm going to belt it to give it some more shape but i like how it looks unbelted as well
other These t-shirts by pure + good are buttery soft and so flattering. they are just loose enough to drape beautifully and the detailing at the neckline takes them just a step above basic tee. i have other from last year, machine washed many many times (on delicate cycle) and they still look almost new. i was hoping to pick up a couple more but they're gone! please retailer, bring these tees back!! i would kill for that beautiful dark blue...
other I purchased this skirt on super-sale but i'm hesitant to keep it. it's not poorly made, just not as sturdy as i would expect a skirt of its price. that said, it's cute and comfortable. i wish it came in numbered sizes because the m is snug but i expect the l would be too big. has a good amount of stretch. shows underwear lines. love the style!
other This turtleneck is already wrapped and it's soon going under the tree for me! i bought it when i saw it in the store and tried it on. it's fitted but not too tight or snug... just fitted and flattering. the lace cutout area is so flattering and unexpected. i love this top and think it will be a wardrobe staple - both for dress and casual. (i'll wash it carefully just in case. it seems well made but i'd hate to snag the lace.)
other This might look good on you if you are very tall and slim. i am a curvy medium and this was not at all flattering, it is a straight cut and hugs in the wrong places. the color is not true: it is black stripes on gray (not cream). i thought the stripes might flatter my shape, but alas, i did not look good in this.the material is very nice, soft and stretchy.
other While contemplating on purchasing these pants. after receiving them, quality was superb, waffle material other spandex, beautiful green color, and other snaps in the front,  zipper and other  front and back pockets. material has alot of give and wide legs. these pants don't come to the ankle so don't expect it. sort of like capri but longer, lose fitting and wide legs. nice addition to my closet. i hit the jackpot now and again w/ this store.
other I needed a dress that was easy to throw on for summer days and this dress is perfect for that. it's flattering, light weight and unique. i've received a handful of compliments while wearing this dress. i am 5' 6" 150 lbs, hourglass figure and typically purchase a small or medium (8-10) and chose a small for this dress. i'd say it's still loose on me- which is what i prefer. the scoop neck and cut out allows you wear a normal bra. however, i've noticed i'm more comfortable wearing a camisole or s
other I'm not usually a fan of simple crewneck sweaters but this one has some nice added details that make it a keeper. the dark red oxblood color is really nice (it manages to be a red sweater without feeling overly holiday), the detailing at shoulder/chest is interesting yet subtle enough to not be distracting and doesn't feel bulky at all, the dropped shoulder seams are done correctly and without the body becoming boxy. it does feel like it might run a tad bit large, but only very slightly, not eno
3 Loved the style and color/design but this dress was simply too short in the front. the slip was also slightly tight over hips. i wish this was longer!
3 I didn't plan to wear this off shoulder. sadly the neck is too loose and big if worn on shoulder. the fabric is nice. i liked the vintage looking design that's black with purple flowers. the body has a lot of fabric and although i ordered size large, i would size down to a medium if i were to reorder. don't think i will, though.
other I was surprised at the positive reviews for this product. its terrible! it cuts you in a weird place to make you look wide. the skirt is also not like the picture. its darker and heavier. the material isnt great. i had to return.
other Very versatile skirt that's suitable for any occasion or any season.
other This is my third top from this designer, and normally i wear a small, but i tried this on in the store and the medium fit much better on me. i am not partial to the black as the knot design was lost, but the sapphire is wonderful. works great with slacks or more casual clothes. i liked the sleeve length as well. i'm not too busty, but i think that other reviews comments of the knot being see through could be a problem.
other Do not waste your money on this.at first, i bought pilcro hyphen chinos short and i loved it. so i bought this pants in store too. i laundry them yesterday and they both came out colorless. i was so shock. fyi, i did not use bleach or chrolox, i mean i don''t use them.i will return them both.still mad. this is bad quality enough worth it.
other This is a really pretty print on a decent top. the only reason i returned is because it didn't look good with my skin tone and the fabric is thin. i'd planned to use it as a later under cardigans.
other I just received this dress and tried it on. it's a nice dress that is flattering but the material was much heavier that i expected it to be. it's way to heavy to wear in the florida heat so unfortunately it's going back.
other Love these shorts. i purchased them in the peach color. the color is perfect, the fit is perfect, they look great. highly recommend!
other I love this top. it is perfect fit. i am 5'3 102lbs, 3other dd. it conforms to your figure.
other This is the softest flannel ever! while i don't think i'd wear it outside, it is super comfy just lounging around. it runs very large, but since it's a flannel romper, not a problem. absolutely recommend for all shapes and sizes!
other Love these jeans! the material is soft and very flattering on the hips.
other Took the plunge and ordered this in the romantic floral pattern. i almost got the black because i thought it would be 'timeless' but the print is so fun - i'm glad i went with it! ordered a size m - for reference, i am 5'6, 135lbs, 34c, 28/39 and the fit is comfortable. i don't need a lot of support :) and i find the coverage adequate up top and on the bottom. i think it'll still fit perfectly even if i lose a few pounds before my beach trip. this is the first one-piece i've had since i was a gi
other The style was really cute but the fit was huge. i ordered an xs. i don't think going to the xxs would have helped. i ended up returning it.
other Received this top as a gift from a friend with great taste. found fabric to have high quality feel and texture and it fit quite well. love how the flutter layer creates a different look.
other The color is great. the fit is accurate and it is a great transitional piece.
other Way too big and had a granny like styling. was very excited but ultimately took it back.
other This dress is lovely! so flattering. i'm 5'6 and 140 pounds pre pregnancy and just into my second trimester. purchased a 4. will work for many more months and again after baby.
other I tried this on in the store on a whim. it is so flattering, soft, and pretty. i generally wear a size 1other and bought a l although the m might have fit, also: it's got plenty of room. the chiffon yoke is not particularly sheer and a nude bra strap is basically invisible, the jersey is adequately opaque so no camisole needed. my dimensions are about 40"  bust x 33" waist.
other Love this top! the colors are so fun and happy, and the fabric/fit are soft and breezy. it is definitely on the boxy side, but not in an unflattering way (in my opinion). super cute in my usual size small.
other The high/low hem is interesting, and the fit looks great. i did find that i needed one size larger than normal.  maybe that's bc these are high rise?  there is also absolutely no stretch in the fabric.
other These are very flattering thick leggings that would keep you warm in the fall and winter, but when i pulled them up i got a big hole in the seam at the waistband at my first trip to the bathroom! obviously you might expect a rip if they were too tight, but these fit perfectly (even on the looser side) and ripped effortlessly. pretty embarrassing given the price! bringing these back! for reference ( if you decide to try your luck), i am 5'7", 128# and my normal size s was perfect.
other Ahh it's delightful! it's a little short in the fit, but it's so cute. and didn't cost an absurd amount like some more heavy weight or full trench coats. love it.
other This is a nice sweater. runs a little larger than size.
3 I should have exchanged it for a smaller size, but i wanted to wear it, so my mistake. i tend to wear size 12-14, and the large is entirely too big. it also had piling right out of the bag. but it is just so soft that i tore the tag off and wore it anyway. if you get this, size down for sure.
other Weighs nothing. so comfortable. great length, not too short. fits a tad loose, but very pretty and easy to wear. fun print, flattering, casual style with a touch of class. 5'3 110lbs and the xs fits just as it shows on the model.
other Love the color and the design. it is slightly see-through which i don't like but it still works wotb a nude bra. very comfortable!
3 I loved this but couldn't believe how small it was.
other I love this top - it has the pattern and detailing that i feel like retailer used to do consistently, but often skimps on now. tit definitely runs small - i usually wear a 6 in retailer tops (sometimes a 4) and the 8 is quite fitted on me.
other Love the floral pattern.  top is loose and flowy, as expected.  i like to tick it into my jeans or shorts, so it doesn't look quite so shapeless on me.
other I tried this on today and it was awesome! great color, great fit, thin summer material but not too thin that it was see through. the slits added a really nice design to this dress, very slimming. my problem is the deep v in the front. for small busted women this might be a deal killer. for me in the xs the v hung even below my boobs, no cami could fix that. unfortunately, cloth and stone tend to make their shirts and dresses with too deep a v, it's always disappointing for me because i love thei
other Bought this sweater on sale off the website. it fits perfectly - nice length. as some others said, a little scratchy at the neck but certainly tolerable - just need to wear a cami or tee underneath. the collar is a nice shape. fabric is a little stiffer than it "looks" in the photos.
other I really love the way this sweater fits. the only negative is that it fits rather tight on the shoulders?i have broad shoulders and the sweater fits fine when my arms are down but a little tight when i raise them. but the size small fit well everywhere else, so i'm keeping it. the orange color is pretty but kind of glows a bit, but wish i'd also gotten it in the blue-green. very pretty and feminine, great with pants or skirts. i'm usually a small or medium (often just for shoulders) but got this
other Sometimes i feel like i have to try on the dresses that sell out super fast, just out of curiosity. and sometimes, they're surprise hits, like this one. i tried on the purple/black/blue option, and i had to have it. it is boxy through the torso, but the length keeps it from being too cutesy--it's pretty short. i'm just 5'5", and i'm not sure this is work appropriate without tights. i may have to try, though, as otherwise it's a great workable dress for summer--not too tight or revealing in the b
other I am pleasantly surprised by this purchase. i went back and forth on buy-in this, but ended up trying it out. so glad i did! it is very flattering and a very nice color. it fits perfectly and i look forward to wearing it with my distressed denim and boots for fall.
other I like this comfy top. i bought it to wear with a cute pair of gold charlie cropped pants i bought from retailer last fall. the only thing i don't like is the odd length of the sleeves. they are somewhere between elbow and 3/4. i am a true xxsp in most tops, but the sleeves end right at my elbow making it difficult to wear them unrolled. for reference i am 5'1" and 107 lbs. a larger size would have been too wide and roomy. overall, i am happy with my purchase.
other This dress is so beautiful, the color is even more vibrant in person, a stunning emerald green. it is well made and doesn't go too low under your arm, which sometimes happens with halters. the halter material is a thicker band that gives nice support. the skirt does a little poof near your hips at the top, look at the back view photo online, you can see it there. at first i was surprised by it because i didn't see that on the front view, but then i decided it was fun and flirty. i received numer
3 This top is really cute online, but that's about it.  it runs large, but even if i sized down the ruffles were a bit much and the top was a little boxy surprisingly.
other I was thrilled when this shirt arrived.  it is as cute in person as in the catalog.  it's soft, it fit perfect, and it looks great with shorts and pants.  it will be my "go to" shirt this summer.
other Really love the pattern and color combination. the dress has an attached lining to around the knee. i would say this is tts or a little big. i'm 5'8" and around 13other and size s fits well with a bit of extra room around the waist. print and fabric cover any perceived flaws and create a long, lean look. i love the feeling of effortlessness--with cute sandals this is an outfit.
other This is a cute and quirky feminine top with the ruffle detailing and polka dot flannel inside the sleeve cuffs. i wish it was little longer and maybe not flannel, then it would be perfect, but overall i liked it. i am 5'5", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame (plus a relatively short torso) and the small fit throughout the shoulders and chest.
other Normally i would take a size 0 or xs in dresses, but after reading the reviews i am glad i took a size larger. the 2p worked out very nicely and i am 5'3 102lbs. it is a bit stiff when i walk around in it and losses some of its shape. don't get me wrong but i love the dress and am always receiving compliments on it.
other As other reviewers have mentioned, this dress runs extremely large. i'm a solid medium in maeve dresses usually and got this dress in the store in a size x-small... and took it to my local seamstress to get it taken in! i get that this is supposed to be a "swingy" and "airy" dress but there was just too much space and material for me. i loved the top and the soft material so i am ok with spending money to get the waist taken in. i think this would be the perfect dress for someone with a slim fig
3 I purchased these in a 26 petite and a 26 regular. the 26r was too long and bunched up terribly pass the knee. they were also loose in the waist and overall body. the 26p fit great in the waist and body, however; past the knee it was too tight and again it bunched but not as bad as the 26 reg. the overall quality of the jean seems fairly good. the fit just did not work for me so these go back and the hunt continues for white jeans. would love it if they made the hyphen jeans in white.
other My husband never has anything negative to say about my clothes until i wore these pants! they are not flattering and kept stretching out until i could pull them off without unzipping them! baggy in the behind and sloppy looking. they are going back asap!
other I'm 5'5" and about 115, 35-36" hip and small bust - the xxs petite is a nice fit, and doesn't hang straight down as it does on the model. it has some shape around my hips, and the slit is slightly above my knee, overall legnth also shorter than shown (good). it's not colorfast when you receive it, so be careful wearing light colored underwear (and maybe wash with only very dark colors the first time or two). i tried a regular xs in store at first, and it fit more like the photos - more of a beac
other I can't believe this top hasn't sold out. it is a great casual top that will go well with anything. i agree with previous reviewer that talked about sizing up to cover straps. i did size up to a large but it didn't get huge around the midsection. i got the red and it will go great with pilcro khakis or denim.
other Eva franco has done it again by creating another fabulously flattering, unique, and compliment grabbing skirt. it runs true to size and is very easy to move in and wear. this is my 10th skirt of hers and i love them all.
other This is basically a poncho with arm holes. but it looks great and is well-made. i got this in the wine, which is a beautiful color. the design is nice and looks expensive (but i'm not sure how it will hold up after washing), it is oversized and a little boxy. i'm a medium or large on top and i ended up purchasing an xs and it fits just fine in the shoulders and arms. the rest of it is still roomy (though short) but perfectly fine. i got this on sale, so it was well worth the price point.
other There were just too many pleats to this thing. it was not flattering. it looks fantastic on this model but not on me. oh well.
other It looks a little more dressy in the picture but it's cotton, soft and very comfortable.
3 I love this piece because of its flattering stripes.i am 5' 9'', 150 lbs and ordered a medium. the large was just too big, the small too short and tight, but the medium fit well. however, the sleeves are a little large which was a disappointment, and because of this there's an awkward excess of fabric on the front next to the armpits. i also experienced that the shirt is not long enough to tuck in, how the model has done.
other This dress is made of a very thick material both on the top and bottom, making it very flattering. lots of compliments!
other Fit great with moving room. colors very vibrant. just right for a house with lots of cool air conditioning!
other Had to have this dress as soon as i saw it in store. i am heavy chested (40dd). bought it in an xl. it is so colorful and vibrant. dress would look good on any skin tone. love that it is a shift dress. perfect with sandals or wedges.
3 Was excited for this shirt. i usually wear a medium to large depending on the cut and material, so i went with a medium. i was swimming in it. definitely recommend ordering a size below your normal.
other Ordered a l and xl, the sleeves were so tight on both sizes but the rest of the shirt was wide and loose. the tight sleeves were not proportional with the rest of the shirt. both sizes had to be returned.
other This dress runs tts. the fabric is a good quality, and it has pockets. i am about 5'5", and it hit just above the knee. i really wanted to keep it, but it hit me at an odd spot and not on my waistline. this made the dress look awkwardly full and me look hippy (despite the fact that my waist is 26" and my hips are 35").
other I loved the design of this blouse and ordered it the first day it was available. unfortunately, i was disappointed on arrival. besides being more muted color-wise, the sizing is way off. i ordered the xxsp and it was huge on me. on the model, it looks like it skims the body, when in reality, it falls like a tent. i tried tucking it into a skirt, but there was just too much fabric.though the neck worked for me, i can see how it might be too small for some people as it is very narrow. also, it
other I love a dolman. the tassled dolman is slimming, light and comfortable.
other I l o v e this sleeveless blouse for is soft tranquil print, wearability from day to night, comfort and fit! the design is flirty yet sophisticated-i wear it with skirts for work and jeans by night. can't say enough good things! everyone should have this beautiful piece in their wardrobe!
other Good reason to read reviews. i concur with others in that it fins large and looks boxy. heavy fabric makes matters worse.
other I bought this dress because i saw it in stores when it first came to retailer. it was stunning. the colors were vivid and the beading was intricate. i regretted not purchasing it immediately. fast forward to today... the dress i received was not the one that was originally in stores. the fabric was different, there was hardly any beading, and the colors were washed out and dull. i read previous reviews saying that the dress was more like the studio pictures than the original promo. but t
other These are perfect with a long tunic for the weekend to run errands! they are not tights-like in the sense that there's full coverage across your bum -- no accidental flashing of anyone. they're not itchy either. i bought these in brown, and want to buy the rest of the colors available!
3 I thought this was such a beautiful cardigan from the online photos. i ordered it in the small size but the fit is strange. the arms and wrist cuffs are so large it cannot be pushed up to stay out of the way for things i would like to do when wearing it (i'm a teacher and my classroom is that kind of environment). i was also confused by the front "collar" ribbing and how it was supposed to lay - open, folded over, partly folded over - it just didn't seem to have a particular style to this area.
other I cannot say enough about these pajama pants. they're beautiful and crazy comfortable. it's a nice change from black or grey. i also love that there are no pockets because i hate how they jut out on me. i wanted a petite l because i am short, but the regular large is fine. i just wear them higher up on my hips. i normally wait for sales on sleepwear, but i couldn't resist on these. they're well worth the investment!
other Very happy with the fit, sizing, and look of these shorts.
other Super soft and stylish. it's a major step up from my overly casual fleece jackets. love it. i think the sizing is dead on so i would disagree with a review that it runs small. i'm 5'10 and 142lbs. typically wear a size s, but sometimes have to size up to a m. i got a s. fits great. not too tight. sleeves are plenty long enough. i typically wear this with skinny jeans to work (aka grad school), and i like that it functions as a jacket on chilly mornings, but its not too bulky so i can keep it on
other Was hesitant to order it as first since i was worried it might be a little too boxy in person. glad i tried it since that turned out not to be the case. drapes nicely (exactly like in the picture) and can be worn either on its own or layered with a cardigan/shrug. loose fit means i can wear it to work, too. am usually between a small and xs but the xs fit me well. also wanted to mention this hits me right under the waist and i'm 5ftother so there is a chance it could be a little too short for someon
other The shirt can be a little boxy, so make sure to order your size! the peplum is a great length in the back.
other I love this dress. it is so soft and comfortable, perfect for summer!! i wish it came in more colors because i would buy everyone!!
other Ok, so yes, it is true that the top part where the sleeves are can be snug a little, especially if you work out, but overall i found the top to run true to my regular size (i only tried on the 0, didn't try bigger). the length was great for me being short, i didn't think i need the petite (i usually do for pants and skirts/dresses, tops on and off). the look of the shirt is also classic, flowy and it looked great with e half tuck. the embroidery is also nice though one part of it seemed loose. a
other Love the way this feels ? epic and flowy and flattering ? and features my shoulders and de-emphasizes shape and size from waist down. waited for it to go on sale and it paid off. i'm wearing it to a wedding this weekend. i can't wait to show it off! highly recommended.
other I bought this on sale in all 3 colors. it doesn't look like much in the photos, but that's really the point. this is a staple, basic piece. layer on colors and prints, like a printed jacket, scarf or bag. i bought this in wine, along with the sweater knit boots and a bag with a print that ties the colors together. the shape of this dress is great - fitted through the waist and not a lot of extra fabric in the skirt. midi is usually a bad length for me 5'2" but since the skirt isn't overwhelming,
other I really wanted to love this dress. the cut out design is beautiful and it is very feminine. however, it does not really cut in at the waist and it left me feeling a bit boxy. i think if it cinched at the waist, it would be perfect. it didn't work out for me, but i think on the right girl, it would be very cute.
other Love the fabric & lace on this top. like other reviews said the arm area is tight where the lace meets the fabric which makes the fit uncomfortable. sadly this top is going back. if you have very skinny upper arms this top will fit fine.
other I love this top! i purchased the gray simply because i felt it would go with more. i can pair it with blue jeans, my pink pilcro chinos, and even my turquoise pilcro shorts. i love that this tee doesn't have the rolled sleeves, so it's a little more finished looking. i tried on both the small and medium and both fit, but i preferred the tapered fit of the small and ultimately went with that. for reference, i'm 5'8", 140 lbs, 32d chest. i do think $58 is hefty for a t-shirt, so you could roll the
other I saw this top in store and immediately picked up the red one. i am usually a 6 in tops sometimes an 8 but ended up with a 4.  feels a little snug in the armpit area but doesn't look it. i ended up getting the honey color one which looks great with white and army green pants. i loved the red one but felt like i was wearing a picnic blanket. it is a little flimsy and probably won't last that long so if you want to wait for it to go on sale and hope they have your size i would do that.
other I ordered this tee despite the price. the fabric is very thin and the quality was poor. nice concept for a tee, but failed in quality and value. it was returned.
other Now i would've been scared off by the fabrics had i not seen the cute, flattering cut if this spring top. love the futuristic look of the fabric and style brought back by the rise design throughout. like the previous reviewer claims, this top is even cuter on us non models (who are pry not as washed out). the color combo is another positive because it's both flattering and versatile!
other I fell in love with this as soon as i tried it on. it doesn't look nearly as good on the hanger, so definitely worth trying on. the fabric is high quality and super comfy; the fit is very flattering. i am curvy, 5'7" and got the navy stripe print in size small. it's very forgiving, fitted without clinging to any "problem" areas. i also love how versatile it is--you can wear it as a dress as shown on the models, or as a tunic over tight jeans or jeggings/leggings. love it!
other I recently purchased this tunic and love it! its not to big, hangs just right, arm holes are not to big and the material is very comfortable! looks great with white jeans, shorts, or just jeans. i will get a lot of wear all year round! fits true to size. oh, slimming too!
other Let it be known that i hate shopping for jeans. i recently had my go-to skinny jeans rip by my back pocket and new i needed to get something new & better stat. i have a pair of black ag sateens that i got a few years ago, and i decided to try out this pair. i got them in the mail yesterday, and i never want to part with them! they are perfection. they hit perfectly on my waist; they're incredibly comfortable and basically make you feel like you're wearing the jean equivalent to yoga pants. they
other The print is even better in person! true to size. flattering fit.
other This sweater is absolutely lovely. i bought it in the sky color which is so pretty, the picture just doesn't do it justice! the yarn is super soft and it seems as though it will be plenty warm this winter. i also love the retro 70's look. a definite keeper.
other Slouchy, longer in the sleeves, a little cropped, great neckline, stylish.....these are just some of the reasons i absolutely love this sweater! i've been looking for a style like this for a long time. i went down a size because of the wide neckline and the fact that it is a bit oversized. i'm petite, 119 lbs., with a 32f bust size. i went with the grey, but i'm loving it so much i might pick one up in the pink. so comfy and cozy and chic!!
other Loving the ombrã© color combination, the smooth lining, the fuzzy felty warmth and the slimming effect when viewed from the front. if you are busty or hourglass, stay tts or size up. if you are straight and/or small busted, size down. if you have a round bottom but slender on top, i'm not sure this dress will fit the way you want, do try it on in person.
other I sized down as other reviewers suggested (usually an 8, went down to 6) and the dress fit fine--but it was not attractive. the cut was like a tent with an empire waist. really just not attractive. maybe it has to do with my body type, but compared to the model, this dress was so unflattering in-person. returned.
3 I'm 5'8" and 130 and this made me look huge. it was a small but too billowy. it is pretty, nice fabric and well made but i returned.
other This is a cute top. not perfectly made, a little boxy, but also not a crop top on me (5'5). it looks cute with high waisted jeans.
other I purchased this top in blue and liked it so i ordered the red color. i hated the way the second one fit. i'm concerned the blue will not wear well after seeing the way the second one looked!
other Saw the grey one on the table at my local retailer. first thing i did was touch it to feel if it's soft and it felt like butta. surprisingly, it's a very snuggly and warm sweater despite it not being very thick. i think the grey is conservative enough for the office and it goes with pretty much everything, yet the geometric shapes make it modern and interesting looking. i hate turtleneck (choke!) and big cowl neck (reminds me of the 80's), but this is a compromise of both which is a bonus. since i
other I got this in the wine, which is a beautiful color. the design is nice and looks expensive (but i'm not sure how it will hold up), the fabric is very nice, medium weight and drapes well. it is a little boxy but would be nice to layer over a button down.
other I like this sweater vest - really nice quality. looks great with ankle lenght jeaens and booties or a shorter skirt as shown on the model. quality is really nice - it's fairly heavy. i love the slits on the slide. i do find it runs a big large.
other I bought this in blue and love it. i usually wear an xs to small in retailer shirts and a small to medium in dresses. i ended up with an extra small petite in this. it is really flattering and hides the stomach enough. i highly recommend the dress if you size way down.
other This chambray halter top is a good summer staple from cloth and stone, but, it is better for longer waists than mine (and, smaller busts). fyi: 36c, broad shoulders/back, short waist - normally i wear a m in c&s, and that is what i tried in this halter top.oddly the overall length was okay, but the armholes were very low. in the m, the bust area was tighter than it should have been for a easy summer top. i think that this is due to the overall length of the bodice. in other words, the top ha
other I absoluty love this dress! it hugs in all the right places, giving a sexy yet very classy look, very much a "mad men" look. the quality is fantastic and could easily pass for a vintage dress that has been kept safely preserved. i would recomend every lady has one of these in her closet, especially when you need to feel just a little bit prettier!
other Love this sweater so much i purchased the grey and the pink. so far no issues with the stitching.
other I definitely agree with the other reviewers who said this top is better suited for someone tall and slender. the design on the lace is beautiful and i love the scalloped hem. but it is somewhat boxy and flowy, which didn't seem to work on my curvy body proportion-wise.
other Bought this shirt on a whim, and it surpassed my expectations. just enough business, just enough pleasure. i wore it with high waisted skinnies and wedges and stopped counting the compliments! excited to try it in other ways. it's summery in print, but fall ish in color, so i think i can get even more use out of it in the next few months.
other I expected this to be a pretty basic peasant top but was pleasantly surprised with all aspects of my purchase. fabric is soft and flowing with a perfect feminine vibe. it has a nice liner and the length and fit are perfect. can be dressed up or down as you like it. does run a bit large but it's due to the style, not the sizing. i ordered my usual size and cannot be happier with it. go ahead-press the button!
other Great transitional top.  comfy and great fit.  i like my tops to be somewhat roomy and this was great in a small.  i usually buy medium.
other Most casual tops are so sloppy now - not this one! great cut, wish there were more color options.
3 Finally a pretty maeve shirt that actually fit my (apparently) giant hulk arms.. but it's so flowy/swingy i had to return it. this might just be a problem with being a larger lady, but the excess fabric made me feel like i was wearing a tent and made me look 10x bigger than i was around my waist/hips, even when balanced out with leggings. i thought about trying to size down but wasn't sure if that would even solve the excess fabric problem and still leave room in the arms. of course i can't try
other I absolutely love this tunic and was pleasantly surprised when it arrived in the mail. i thought it looked really cute in the photo here, but it's even better in person and is extremely flattering on. so happy.
other I was worried at first that this dress might make me look like a circus tent but it is actually incredibly flattering. also super comfy! first day wearing if i got compliments from friends and strangers!
other Got the petite size. dress is swing style, so extra fabric is expected. can wear a nude bra or strapless. dress is beautiful in person, more so than online. very comfy and stands out without being flashy, just pretty and different. nice silk (matte, not shiny).
other I&#39;m taller (5&#39;8), so it&#39;s not uncommon for things to be too short on me, but this was really short for the style.  it was very wide and loose all over in my usual size - both up top and in the wavy part below.  the style really just did not work with the length.  it looked very odd.
3 Beautiful dress appears well-made, but unfortunately i wasn't able to get it on! about 6 inch gap in the zipper over chest area. first time i've ever sent something back to retailer for not fitting.
3 This is a lot shinier in person, and the elastic band is really tight but i still selected true to size.there is a hi-lo hem going on that doesn't flatter my legs but it looks fantastic from the side.due to the stiffness of the material and the tightness of the band, it can get crumply on the side if you don't get the right size. the material feels a little thin and scratchy.
other Color is not like photo and fit doesn't work if you're busty
other Loved this romper! wish it was offered in petite... arm sleeves are too long once it's off shoulders.
other Bought this shirt in the colorful polka dot print and i'm obsessed! like previous reviews mentioned, it runs a little small in the chest. i'm normally a medium but am a 36c so ordered the large and it fits perfect! with the way the buttons are spaced i think all sizes will pull a little no matter what. it's a beautiful shirt and i plan on ordering the blue one as well.
other Yay for the return of shirts that show your form but don't reveal the flaws! i bought this in cream which only seems to be in stores right now. the stripes on the cream version are vibrant and beautiful. the weight of the top is very nice and really hugs your shape. i did think it ran a tad small. i bought the large but also could have worn the medium.
other In agreement with all the reviewers before me, this dress is gorgeous!i am 5'4" 120lbs 34a and got this is in a size 0 and it fits perfectly but i would be in a little bit of trouble if i were significantly larger up top, so if you are, definitely size up.the material is thick, structured and very well made. every time i wear this out i get a ton of compliments!one of my favorite parts about it is the intricate embroidery on the neck-line that gives the illusion that you are wearing a necklac
other These pants are great, as is the case with most c of h jeans.  they are a perfect length if you are 5&#39;5&quot; or shorter (i.e. you don&#39;t need to cuff them several times).  i love the relaxed but chic look.  they run large so definitely size down at least one size.  so happy they were on sale!
3 I wanted to love this shirt and thought i would based on the reviews. it runs really large however and while i love how flows it is i also looked pregnant. i am keeping though- looks nice layered under a jacket or sweater but alone i feel it looked sloppy and big....... which is sometimes just what you want so it is staying in my closet.
other Really great pair of pants/leggings. considering a second pair. great flattering fit. i ordered the petite as well because i was concerned about the length but the stride on the petite a was to short and the regular was not too long after all.
other Green color is fantastic - dark forest green. material, wool, is substantial and of good quality. however, on my 5'1", 120lb athletic frame, i felt both the petite xs and petite s were too small for me when worn over a v.v.v. thin ls t-shirt. i also thought it was a bit too short in the back. the petite medium would have been a great fit for me, but all gone.
other Fits true to size with good coverage. stayed put when i was in the pool.
other These would have been the perfect black pants! great cut, love the wide band in the front, true to size, quality construction. but a zipper in the back?!!! i had to ask my husband to help me zip them up. perhaps they would be easier to put on if my bum were a little smaller, but the pants fit perfectly - they were just too hard to put on. sending them back, since i don't have an assistant to zip them up whenever i need.
other This blouse is wonderful. i just got and wore the wine colored blouse today. i received so many compliments. i love it and with the sale price it is so worth it.
other This is a beautiful color top! it can be dressy or casual but the design is spectacular!i paired it with one of the new retailer pencil skirts and everyone in the store looked it!i wish they had other colors!!!!!!
other Just as breathtaking in person . . . and in a totally comfortable, soft, stretch fabric. i'm 5' 8" 120 lbs. 34b; purchased the size 0 and other for comparison; decided on size other as the size 0 was really tight in the chest area--meant only for the tiniest! the dress is long on me and i'll likely get it hemmed up a bit so it hits just above the knees--but i'm grateful it's too long (something i can fix) rather than being too short.
other Every year around this time, our beloved retailer comes out with a wool sweater coat. i've seen every style over the last five years and this year they have outdone themselves!!! this coat is a dream. not too thin and not too thick...it's the perfect layering piece. the fabric has perfect stretch in it. the colors are lovely (i ended up with the cream color, but i loved the green too!!) in many sweater coats i prefer an xl, but because of the stretch the l was just perfect. i'm 5'8 and it hits wel
other Love this top! i've worn it once and received several compliments. i'm 5'7", 127, and the small fit well. i'm happy with my purchase.
other These are my first pair of mother denim and certainly not the last. they fit true to size. i am a 26 in designer denim such as j brand, paige, ag. i bought these in a size 26 and they fit perfectly. they hug my curves nicely. i am 5'3 so they bunch up just a little bit at the ankles which i can easily have altered, but honestly don't need it. the quality is great - nice denim material with a lot of stretch to it. i love my skinny jeans tight and these were exactly what i was looking for!
other I first ordered this in the patterned denim. the online photo looks washed out in comparison. the blouse has very pretty detail all along the body and cute brass buttons. the pattern unfortunately looks more vivid in person and as result, i did not like. i brought it to the store and tried on white but it was very sheer (all though the pleating in front helps). i ended up exchanging it with plum which is also beautiful - not as much sheen as shown on the photo, but still beautiful.
other The light red color is so rich! i would describe it as a burnt coral/red. i love the length - long enough to pair with leggings, but not overwhelming in my 5'3" frame. one sleeve began to unravel the first time i wore it, but i was able to mend it easily and have had no trouble since. i think it was a flaw specific to my sweater and not s general indication if poor quality. hubby says this is his favorite sweater on me too!
other It's a great light jacket for early spring. ideal topper for jeans or denim skirt.
3 The sweater is very very warm. it looks okay, not the best but not bad. i had high expectations so was disappointed to see no closure, i don't wear sweaters and jackets without closures. i like having the option of closing buttons if it gets any colder. so i am sending it back.
other The issues the other reviewers mentioned didn't bother me as i don't have the prior years version to compare. i love the color and feel of the fabric.  a little heavier and great for early fall layering. the armholes weren't big for me but i got a small and would normally be a medium. the cut works great for a very curvy petite frame. it doesn't add bulk but does flatter a larger chest. i can see why this doesn't work for taller ladies as the pockets and hip do flare with the heavier fabric but
other I wasn't going to purchase this dress because it was given other star. however, i ordered it and i was so glad i did!!! i'm 5'1, 105lbs this dress fit me perfectly, it really compliment my petite body. i get so much compliments! it is not easy to order anything for a petite frame but this dress really show off my body without showing too much.
other I've got a bit of a love/hate relationship with this top. the fabric feels a little odd and wrinkles crazy hard, and i'm not a fan of the open ladder ribbon over the bust (really? who needs to see the top of my bra?). but i love love love the overall fit, the details (like the polka dot trim and the sheer tucks) and the color (blue green). it looks good tucked in or loose, and i can layer it under cardigans and jackets. i'll get a matching ribbon and sew it in under the ladder ribbon so it's act
other First i found the picture of this blouse stunning because the colors caught my attention . with that said, i found myself thinking of all the many events this could worn to, dressed up or down. so.... i found myself ordering it asap, paranoid that others were thinking i was thinking the same thing. well , i received it in the mail , and it was better than i thought!!! the colors and cut of this blouse is just as in the picture. i personally love this article/pattern of art, as i see it as an exp
other I went out on a limb ordering this romper. it's not really in my "wheelhouse" the whole romper thing. but it was a home run! i was afraid it might look too young and that i couldn't "pull it off," but the long sleeves and overall style was perfect. and my twenty something nieces were obsessed with it as well. as far as fit, i'm 5'7" 134lbs and ordered a size 4. i have a long torso and was concerned because some people said it ran short there, but i didn't have any trouble with that. i just took
other I have been struggling to find a nice flowy summer dress that isn't too short. i am petite but do not like to wear my dresses too far above the knee, so i ordered this in the 00 regular. this dress was not what i expected. it is not flowy, but rather a heavy and stiff fabric. it is also way too wide. it looks like it can't decide whether to be a box or a bag. it is also shorter than advertised. last thing to disappoint was the color - darker and more muted than the photo on the website. i can't
other I was expecting not to fit into this because i'm womanly, and generally wear a size 16 in things. but the picture was so gorgeous i had to try. i'm so happy i did. it slipped right on and is flowy yet not overly so. it still has shape. the colors are exactly as it is portrayed on the site. i love having this in my closet!
3 This sweater is much more cropped than shown. the sweater i received was only 2other inches long. the color of the trim is black, not the navy or plum that i expected. quality does seem good.
other Although i love retailer, this product isn't the quality or presentation i expect from them. the dress arrived stuffed into a small plastic bag and was a crumpled mess. the fabric wasn't soft and fluid as i expected, but rather was stiff and a little scratchy. i purchased the ecru version, which was also slightly darker than the photo showed. i returned the dress and will keep looking.
3 I am 5'2" and 115lbs......ordered the blue motif in small petite. they were not only too big overall but were way too long. i had to roll them up several times to get the right length. because of fabric design these would definitely have to be hemmed. i had to check tag because i thought for sure i got sent a regular length but they were petite. not sure if they are worth trying in a smaller size..... pants were really comfy but maybe too pajama like for my taste.
other This dress looked adorable online, but unfortunately, it's not flattering at all, and it's completely see-through. completely. the material is so thin that i can't imagine it would hold up very well over time. this one is definitely going back.
other The fold over is so comfy. not the most flattering but really when you are wearing it you are going for comfort i think. bought these on sale and trying to decide if they are worth it or not
other This dress fits so perfectly.  just the right amount of skin, not too bare, not too short, not too long.  can't wait to wear it.  great quality.
other Love the fit and color, but the material is my favorite. it's so soft and comfy. feels like your walking around in your pjs!
3 This shirt is really cute but a little stiff. it does come with a slip, but the slip was tight, but the shirt fit, maybe even a little big. i used another cami under which was better. i think think the sizing is off in terms of slip vs. the actual shirt. i got it in the store with the 30% off, so it was a good deal. it does stretch out as you wear it, so it will get bigger and it did make me look a little bigger, but still cute on and for a summer shirt, it's thin, so it does work well in that r
other I saw this sweater coat in store and thought it was gorgeous! i was turned off by the price so i waited for it to go on sale. luckily, i snatched it up right away. as other reviewers have stated, it is meant to be worn as a coat/jaclket and for me the medium ( i am usually a size 8 or medium in retailer) fit was slighly oversized on my 5'9 145lb frame. i admit that this not an item that i would usually have in my wardrobe and was not sure how the sweater and the fit looked on me. i was afraid it w
3 These looked super cute online and i was excited about getting them. i wanted that slightly baggy look to be able to carry them off similar to the model. so i referred to the size chart and ordered the size that said it would allow this. based on the size chart for this item...it is wrong. i should have had extra room. instead they were tight around the hips. i measured my hips before ordering and i am a seamstress....so i know where and what to measure. this is a nice quality product though...j
other I love everything from retailer but this top did not fit all that flattering. the neck line fits a little weird. too bad. color was nice though. i returned the top.
other Skirt is made well and beautiful colors. runs a tad small. i am typically a 4/6 and i ordered the 8 (based on other reviews) and it fit well.
3 I love the looks of this sweater on the model! after receiving it, it was still very pretty and stylish to look at. my problem is that i am petite, and the sweater seemed to run very large. it wasn't very fitted. i think the detailing in the back would look better fitted. it made me look rather dowdy and/or matronly unlike how it looks on the model. i think that was because it was just too big. i returned it.
3 Despite other reviewers comments on size - i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it. i'm typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small. the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit i'd said for more for a b. (if i lifted my arms i would literally come out of it)
other This tank is great - goes well with black pants of skirt. it's a nice texture that doesn't show too many wrinkles so will travel well. it's a bit hard to get the buttons done in the back of the neck, but i assume that will get easier with time.
other I live in a hot and humid climate so this tank is perfect for everyday use. you can dress it up or down and the lightweight material keeps you cool. i bought it in other colors and may go back for more. i wish i would have found them sooner.
other This duster is very nicely put together and is mid-weight. i'm not sure it's worth this price point but it's not cheaply made, either. the colors are as shown on the website to a 't'. the length is also as shown. i am 5'other 14other lbs and 34d and the small is perfect. i think if one is considering multiple layers underneath a medium would serve the purpose nicely but the small will accommodate a blouse or tee underneath and is just perfect. colors are dark teal, salmon and gold. this is a three seaso
3 It's a pretty top with a lot of intricate detail and love the edge the studs give it but it looks fuddy duddy in ivory. looks nicer in black but you loose some of the detail in the dark color. the lace is not soft either but has more of a polyester, slightly scratchy feel. sizing is true to size and it fits well if the style floats your boat.
other Cute style, cute color, cute cut.  and i got it on sale!
other I am 5'8 and 220lbs (extremely muscular) i ordered a size large and it hangs very nicely over my curves, the neckline looks pretty good with my broad shoulder, and the dress comes about other inches above my knee. i think people with curves would really like this dress but it does lack shape so beware if you're looking for something with some structure. the blue is gorgeous and the fringe details are very cute. this dress does seem to run a bit big.
other Fell in love with the design of this sweater. its lightweight, appropriately sized, with delicate details. the pockets are somewhat hidden which is a nice feature. the shawl collar falls just right. the unique design in the rear makes it stand out from your standard cardigan. i purchased in rose for a rich color addition to my wardrobe. the xs fit perfectly. i'm 5'3 and typically wear xs in retailer tops.
other I have been dying to try a mara hoffman bathing suit, so i went for this one. unfortunately, the design of the bathing suit is not like what they sent me. the middle where the tops meets the bottom, is squared off, not like that v that it looks like in this photo. it also makes for major side boob/sagging on each side. i was very disappointed.
other This shirt is amazing! the soft fabric, detailed embroidery, and gorgeous little beads/sequins..all fabulous quality and make this piece worth the price. i love the length and cut of this too - not boxy, yet not too tight or fitted; just covers my bum. can be dressed up or down.
other This piece is a winner solely b/c of the sleeves. otherwise, it's a plain, large tee. however, the sleeves are gorgeous and so unique! had they had my size left, i would have purchased in other colors (i got pink). it runs large, so size down.
other This too is great to throw on when running to class or going out. love the two different materials and the back detail.
other This is absolutely a 1-season top. the material is very thin and flowy, with the front v plunging pretty dramatically. i'm using mine as a swim cover, and i'm thrilled to report the mottled pattern on the cotton hides perspiration(!)the first time i wore this top, i paired it with denim shorts, and the hemline completely covered the shorts, so it was way more of a mini-dress than a long shirt--which is ok. if i wear it again as a top rather than a swim cover, i'd just go with yoga shorts benea
other The color was a little darker than it looks online, but i like it!
other I love the design, that's why i'm going back for a smaller size. i bought a medium and that size was made for someone 50 lbs heavier than i. usually i'm good at choosing my size online, but not today. if you are curvy and round like me still go for a smaller size because this dress has a lot if room. also i wish more clothes would come into the stores to try on, please!
other I am very petite and ordered the xs. it is too big which is often the case. i gauge how much i like something by my willingness to spend even more money on alterations. i love this jacket so much that i am willing to go through that extra step. i love winter and this is a perfect winter top. the faux fur is very soft and cozy and has a rich look to it. i have yet to have it altered which is the only reason for my other stars under quality. i don't yet know how it will fit once complete. the fact tha
other Love the rifle print on this dress. the fit is relaxed and very comfortable and can be adjusted with the tie in the back. the fabric is a nice weight, great for year-round wear.
other I saw someone try this on when it was 40% off sale, and should ahve purcahsed it then... ended up going back today for it. it is very soft, adn flattering. also, i purchased the balck, this can go with pretty much anything: jeans, skirts, dresses, you name it - very neutral and flattering fit. nto sure if petite would have worked but too late anyway.
3 Ok so this top is as cute in person as it is online. runs very small as theres no stretch or give in fabric. i normally wear 1other and i couldnt even halfway get this on lol. i may consider a 14-16 but the stores didnt have this yet to try on. the ladies at the counter were crushing on this top though!if you can find your fit this top is great for layering!
other I love this jumpsuit. i've worn it twice and received many compliments both times. absolutely gorgeous. i couldn't be happier. 5'5", 135, 34c-6.
other Runs small. i'm usually a size sm for retailer clothing (for reference, i'm 5'4, 129lbs, 36b). the tie around the waist of this dress is not a functional tie that you can relax a bit to give yourself more room around the waist. i could not fasten the buttons to close the dress on the size 8. the size 10 fit enough to fasten the buttons but there was a lot of extra fabric and the arm holes were very large. pretty, vibrant colors but size up and be warned of the large armholes.
other I ordered a m/l in this vest and it fits perfectly. thirst is cozy and stylish. in fact, i ordered the same vest in another color! it's versatile enough to wear with both skirts and jeans. i also think it's a timeless piece that will stay in style for years to come.
other I am 5'10" 150lbs and size 8 fits me perfectly. the print is lovely and the fabric has a nice flow to it. at this price point the dress should have a lining.
other This top is large like with free people i got an extra small and washed it right away and put it in the dryer and it is soft and perfect. so comfortable and will be a go to top with jeans, pj bottoms or leggings/ i love the pocket and my cell phone fits perfectly. i am now ordering the other color. for reference i am 5.5" and 12other pounds.
other These are nice, flattering short. however the colors and patters are not quite as pictured. i almost suspect they are slightly different on each short. exmaple: on the picture online the left leg seems to be mint green and the right one blue. the ones i received the left leg is a darker, bluishgreen color. the right leg is orange. i would hae prefered the colors on the photo but it is not a big deal i guess. i ordered the color block bra as well and it has the same issue: colors and patterns are
3 This jacket is cozy, warm, and very cute, but after the 1st washing (according to the manufacturer's instructions) it began to pill and has worsened each time.
other I wasn't sure about the dress on the rack. lace can either look amazing or make you look like a doily. it was on sale so i figured why not? let's try it on. it is gorgeous on. true to size. i am usually a 0 and the 0 fits me perfectly. the quality and tailoring is amazing. it is a heavier dress with the lace and lining so it may not work on a super hot day. overall, i love the fit and quality of the dress. i love it even more on sale!
other I love the muted red pleated ruffle tank. i usually wear a large in retailer tops. this top fit a bit loose. there is a bit more space around the armholes. this only concerns me because i can't wear a bra or cami without it showing. just mentioned this in case others may wish to buy one size smaller. i am 68, around 5/5" and weight 14other lbs. love the young, modern tops that i find at retailer. i just ordered the white version of this tank top in a medium to see how it will fit (btw, there is a
other Adorable with black pants or jeans. covers the part of your arm you might want covered :-)
3 I love these pants -- bought them in the mustard color. my only complaint is that they are not colorfast -- i washed them in cold water with other colored items -- most of which belonged to my husband. not good -- and pretty much ruined an entire load of laundry except for these pants. retailer -- please color test your garments. there is really no excuse for fabrics like this to run in this day and age!
other This is my 4th byron lars dress and i just love this designer. his dresses all fit the same as far as i can tell. i had bought this dress as my sister in law recommended it so much and she was right it is stunning!
3 Beautiful blouse in theory, however, on my 5'9" frame it came off like a costume. i truly had a nice chuckle as i looked at myself in the mirror. had to sadly return it
other My experience with these have been great and the colors are even more beautiful in person! they're easy to dress up for work and going out and easy to dress down for hanging out on the weekends. i am typically a size 31-3other and 30's fit me like a glove. i also typically wear petite but don't like the just-above-the-ankle cut of these so i purchased them in regular and wear them as pants. i can un-cuff them with heals/wedges or keep the double cuff and they hit me perfectly as full-length pants wi
other Fits a bit on the bigger side, but also being the style of the top. i would order down a bit. i'm usually a other on top( 34c) and the xs was perfect. the wine color is classy. it's a timeless piece...
3 Stylist in store warned be about issues with buttons falling of easily. loved the look, so bought it anyway. lost other buttons on the first wear. it did not feel snug on me, but i guess i could try a size up and see if the buttons hold a bit better. either way i will return or exchange.
other I agree with the review that says this is better in person than in the pic online. great sale price and super cozy but thin enough to transition to spring!
other Beautiful and femine dress. it comes with a slip which is a big plus. it fits well and the sleeves are flowy and just at the right length. the only downside is that the bottom is not hem and being lace, it is delicate. you have to take care wearing this.
other The shirt is a very cute cut. it "poofed" out a little more than i thought and kind of looked like a tutu. but, i wore it with white jeans to work and got a lot of compliments!
3 Cropped and wide- would look cuter on someone who is more petite. was too wide and cropped for me. very sheer.
other This dress is as cute as represented in the picture. the adjustable ties on the sides allow your dress to be form fitting or a looser, more casual look. the colors of the dress and the beading are beautiful. the dress looks great paired with a pair of black ankle boots!
other This is a very feminine and pretty top, but it runs really small. after reading the reviews, i ordered a size larger; however, i think i should have ordered 2-3 sizes larger.
other Loved these in store when i tried them on but was in between sizes so i ordered them in the larger size. boy do i regret that! these stretch out so much i have to wear a belt with them and it gives me this saggy bunchy front when i sit...not attractive. wish i could return them, but i took the tag off and wore them not knowing this before hand!! if in between sizes definitely size down.
other I did not have the issue that a previous reviewer did, there were ruffles on my shirt. the one thing i didn't know was how wide the top ran. i ordered my usual size 8 and it fit with no problems. i'm a 36b. the only thing is that in the model shot, the shirt is tucked into the pants and you don't get to see the full volume of it. even the model shot of the shirt from the back doesn't show the wide sleeves and body of the shirt. its not a big problem, since the shirt can be tucked but i will have
other This top is so lovely, i was worried of the color on my pale skin, but it is complementary, nice warm tones. yes, it is a tank, but i can see this as a transition piece into fall with a nice blazer, jeans, boots... the xs regular is perfect for me, length is adequate. if i were to go with petite, i might think it is too short. it is flowy, but still has shape, more than a swing top, so very flattering. the back is really cute too, definitely need a strapless for me, due to the thin straps...
other Take a look at this dress in person or on instagram. the model photos on this website make it look washed out and bridal. irl the lace is a gorgeous ivory tone that looks great casual and dressed up. i'll be wearing this with leather and denim! i chose the smallest of my size range and it fits very comfortably. if you are busty you may want to size up. i am 135# 36c 38/27/3other and i bought size 8.
other These are great pants. i love the fit and the taper of the leg. these will be my "go to" black pants for the fall season!
other I am usually a medium/large and was pleased to fit in the small/medium that i ordered after reading some of the reviews. lovely piece, great to wear over a short sleeve t-shirt, 3/other of a sleeve shirt or even a long sleeve shirt when weather permits here in florida. very happy i ordered this!!
other I absolutely love this top. i managed to snag one that had been returned to a store, so i didn't have to order it. i love the cute and the overall boho feel to it. i feel like it's true to size, as i'm normally a medium in retailer.
other Love this cardigan. fits just as i expected. very structured in the front with a bit of flair in the back.
other I tried a pair of the hyphen chinos on at retailer and loved them. they are comfortable and a great casual look. i bought two more pairs in different colors on line.
other I needed this dress as soon as i saw it on a mannequin in the store. unfortunately, when i tried on my usual size (other regular), the armholes were so big that you'd be able to see my bra no matter what. i purchased a other petite online later that day. it fits perfectly! i received so many compliments on this dress. a few issues though: (1) this dress wrinkles like crazy. i know it's linen, but i looked like a mess after wearing it for just a few hours. definitely don't wear it to work and expect to l
other This pullover is great for lounging! so warm and cozy!
other Skirt has lots of stretch and comes up to waistline so i am not sure yet how i will wear it but tucked in or out it looks very stylish and the dark denim is of course slimming.
other This super cute skirt has a beautiful drape and overall fit. i was afraid the tie at the front would emphasize my slight tummy, but to the contrary, the skirt is flattering and slimming. at 5'3", the front of the skirt hits at my upper to mid knee. 118 lbs., 26" waist, 36" hips, size other regular is a perfect fit.
other I really love the front of this shirt. however, the back of the shirt is more of a jersey material so it doesn't seem to match the front of the shirt. i still wear it and it looks cute, but it threw me off a bit at first.
other Lovely, lovely dress, great quality. unfortunately runs rather large at the hips. i wear a size other and the xs fit well in the chest but large at the hips.
other This tunic is super comfy and will look great with leggings or skinny jeans. i absolutely love the detailing on the sleeves. i am so glad i ordered this item!
other Beautiful fit and true to size. highly recommend. they are long and you will need to have them hemmed but they are soft and feel amazing on.
other I just got this and couldn't wait to wear it to work today. it is such a pretty designed top. unfortunately, it is falling apart as i write this review. one sleeve is unraveling. there are strings hanging off all over the lacy arms. am so disappointed in the quality. i'll be sending it back when i get home.
other Just received these this morning and so happy. cartonnier always makes a substantial quality product. might run a little large,depends how roomy you want them, lovely colors and perfect length. wish they came in other colors.
other I went a size down on this top. it was to billowy in my regular size. it has the elastic waist but it was bunching up too much in that area. i love the embroidery. . it is gorgeous. . will have to hand wash for sure.
other I loved this dress and i am usually a other or other in dresses. this was cut too small on the bust. i'm a 32c and it pulled at the chest. i didn't re-order it because i felt it would look more like a house dress and be too baggy in the hips.
other This dress is great! it's the perfect transition piece from summer to fall. it is very comfortable. the material and fit are similar to an oversized sweatshirt. overall, i love it.
other I ordered the red motif in size xl. for me, the fit matches the model so i think it's true-to-size. the only larger area on me is for the armholes. i use a cami so my bra won't show when raising my arms. since it's made of rayon/spandex and is a longer length, it's a little clingy along my hipline for my pear-shape. but, overall, it's so soft and comfortable. the colors in the floral pattern are beautiful. prettier in person. there's no problem with pattern placement either. a great top for summ
other This has such awful proportions. i'm 5'0 and 100 lbs, ordered xxs petite (in the neutral color). the seam at the bust literally hits in the middle of my bust!! it looks very unflattering, and it's very pronounced. i'm only 5'0 and already the seam hits at such a high point on me. below the seam the sweater is all scrunched up where it's sewed, and it balloons outward and is very square from there down. very shapeless sweater and not flattering at all unless you have your arms by your sides to hi
other I am very glad i purchased these shorts on sale. bought the coral color in a large. 5'7" 140lbs with a generous underside and long legs, i usually wear a m or a l in yoga pants. the l here fits really nicely--not too tight and enough length in the inseam so that i don't feel silly practicing outdoors in the park. the rise is also perfect.
other I saw this at the store today. very excited about it but i had no idea how to get it on! there is a side zipper so i attempted to step into the jumper through the collar but could never get my arms through! from what i could see on my body, it would have been too short in the crotch. i decided not to fight with it to put on entirely. i gave up. cute shade of green though.
other I was pleasantly surprised when i received this top in the mail. i expected the top to be more of a tee shirt but it is very soft and more like a light sweater. i feel the sizing is true-to-size but the design is not meant to be close to the body. for me, the shoulders and length were perfect.this top is all about the sleeves. matador? perhaps, but it was the sleeves that attracted me to this sweater. i will wear with with a vest, skinny jeans and booties.
other Love this white jean jacket! love the stretchy fit.
other Love! i wish this came in additional motifs! hits at hip, i have a long torso, perfect for high rise skinny jeans and sandals.
other This is an awesome shirt! gorgeous quality and design. can be dressed up or down! it runs slightly large i ordered a small. i would still order a small but if you are trying to decide between a small and an extra small i would get the extra small.
other This sweater is very pretty. the pictures online do not show the intricate knitting and the lovely details or how delicate the yarn is. i bought the light orange color and i think it will transition nicely into spring. the shape is very figure flattering as well. overall, i am very happy with my purchase.
other I love this unique t-shirt. the fall colors and ranchers theme are perfect with skinny jeans and boots. a western look that's feminine. the shirt is very soft, ordered my usual size small, a little long but good for tucking in.
other This may be the most beautiful top i've ever purchased from retailer!  gorgeous, classy, comfortable and one-of-a-kind!  i wish there were another pattern available so i could buy it.  runs large; buy a smaller size than you usually wear.  you will feel chic and confident in this flattering top.  i wear it on the shoulders; a perfect "10"!
other If you are self conscious about your arms and want a tee that has style then this is the one. soft fabric with a flutter sleeve makes this top so flattering. i purchased the turquoise and will purchase other colors. it's flowy comfortable and a must have!
other Perfection. soft. lived in feel and look without holes or rips. and for someone who is other ft other in. they are just the right length if i don't feel like cuffing the bottom. fit tts.
other I have been searching for the perfect white shirt. this is it! i love how the collar lays and the longer length and frayed hem are perfection! the fabric is super soft, too. i am very pleased with this purchase!
other No. this is one of the most unflattering things i've ever put on my body. i'm a very well-proportioned hourglass - i tend to wear a small despite a booty and 36d chest - this made me look huge. don't do it.
other Great very flattering bohemian dress! and it's silk!
other The embroidery is actually navy blue, not black like it shows in the photos, which was even better for me. these are so soft and feminine looking. love love love! please make more decorated and embroidered hyphens like you have in the past retailer :)
other I ordered size medium. the fit is true to size. the color and pattern work beautifully with the delicate yarns and design of this sweater. as other reviewers have stated, it is very thin and lightweight. in my opinion, it serves more as an accessory rather than it being functional as a cardigan worn for warmth. when i tried it on, i considered whether it would provide any warmth at all...summertime air conditioning, etc. the answer is no... if i decide to keep it, it will be for its aesthetic...
other I love this shirt. the quality is great, and very soft. the length seems a bit short, i will only wear it tucked in to a higher waisted skirt. the arm holes are tight.
other I purchased this in blue. it has a soft fabric and seems well made. i have worn it several times and think it is quite comfortable. i bought one size up due to comments on the site, but my daughter thinks i should have stuck to the size chart.
other The color and fit is amazing on this dress. i am 5"7 and went with the small and the length wasn't too short either.
other I bought the blue pattern and really have found this print to be very fun and flattering and the tunic style great for work and play. highly recommend!!!
other I couldn't be happier with this skirt! i was expecting a jersey-type material, but was pleasantly surprised by the thicker, textured, higher quality material. the ruffle on the front is such a cute feature. this skirt moves and flows very nicely when walking. it is lined and has an elastic waistband, it's super comfortable. so far i've paired it with a bright red knotted tee and a sheer white sleeveless button-down. i receive compliments every time i wear it! i'm 5'2", 110 lbs, i ordered an xs a
other Beautiful material- and washable!! i'm vertically challenged and the slits are a tad bit high, even for me- but still tasteful. i would suggest sizing down as i'm normally a medium in retailer but due to the nature of the material i opted to size down and i'm so glad i did!! no arm hole struggles with my particular dress either. overall just a really cute, versatile, cozy and functional option that will certainly get plenty of exposure for many winters to come.
other I agree with the other reviewer -- it's refreshing to find a top that isn't all baggy or sheer, which seems to be the current trend right now._______pros:- lots of stretch. this was so comfortable and the rayon lining inside really makes this breathable.- the ruched detailing, sleeves and overall length is great.- no cami needed with the white. i see in the pics on the model that appears to be cami underneath. i wrote a nude bra and didn't have an issue at the front because it's two la
other Runs big so size down. i love this top for many reasons but armholes are big so went to xs and i am usually a small or medium. xs was perfect and still long enough for me. gorgeous fabric and color and flow. got tons of compliments! very feminine and comfy. looks great with jeans and white crops.
3 I tried this on at the store, and though it was pretty, i was a little underwhelmed. it fit but had no give so it might not have been too comfortable for movement unless sized up. the embroidered polka dots were a lovely idea, but the quality was not great - they were already fraying and pretty irregular looking. the idea of the top was better than the execution.
other I love this top in peach! i usually wear a size 8 and ended up buying the large because that was all they had in store. it fits well but loose. i usually front tuck it in. what i love the most about this top is the perfect way it slouches off your shoulders. very effortless but doesn't feel like it is falling off. a few other off the shoulder tops i tried are either falling off or rising up (and you constantly have to pull them down over your shoulders) due to elastic in the shoulder. this top h
other This is an adorably gorgeous swing dress. the fabric is soft and flowy, and everything a swing dress should be. i was concerned that it would be too short, but it's the perfect length-fun while still being classy. a nice, chunky, eccentric bib necklace and nude sandal wedges would complete this outfit beautifully. highly recommend!
3 I wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors, but after only a few minutes of wearing them, i was having to pull them out of my bottom! why does women's underwear so frequently ride up? i normally wear a size 4/28, and ordered these in a m, but i guess they were still too small, which seems unreasonable to me. they are soft and pretty, but i will not be ordering more.
other This is a unique blouse and well worth a try. it is pure wool, so dry clean only. though it is wool, it is actually very thin and lightweight. i didn't find it to be scratchy..i am a size xl, but in this blouse the large fit fine. the narrowest part of this blouse is the width of the shoulders, everything else is very voluminous. for this reason, it doesn't flatter my full figure; it makes me look much heavier than i am. my only options are to return it, or bring it to a local seamstress who
other Had been eyeing this for a while. print is beautiful in person, just as pictured. tts fit (size 8, 5'7", 150#, pear shaped). comes within a couple inches of my knees so long enough to wear to work.
other I find that petite gals with short (,muscular) legs can have a hard time finding cropped pants that fit right. the flare on these makes the pants oh so flattering. the material is nice and thick and holds you in. the colors and patterns are beautiful fall colors, quite lovely and subtle, there is a nice stretch to the pant, the waist has nice closures, can't wait to weer these! i ordered the 0p and htey fit perfectly. (11other lbs, 26.other in wiast)
other Love this! i sized up to xl from large.. great pattern. very soft. i am thick legged and big booty. this romper is the perfect length. the only issue is when i need to use the bathroom. hard to unzip from the back in a hurry. i had my husband unzip for me in order to pull down.
other This top is really pretty. i love the details on the back tail of the shirt. the colors in this shirt are really pretty more like a peachy pink to me. i will however line dry this shirt because of the different fabric on the tail of the shirt. i would not iron that portion of the shirt either. overall, i am completely in love with this shirt. it will be a staple in my closet.
other Very poorly made- wide and short, very unflattering. the material is advertised as cotton, but it felt very synthetic.
other Like other reviewers, i'm glad i sized down. this is a cute tunic that is definitely great quality, lightweight chambray. i love that it has pockets, but they do puff a bit at my hips.
other Really gorgeous print! i purchased these to go with the top (also recommend it as well) and i love these! i have a larger behind, and it's nowadays it seems to find swimsuits with full coverage without feeling like a diaper - these are it. there is elastic at the leg openings, so that may be uncomfortable for some, but i found no problem with it. for reference, i am usually a 6/8 28/29 in pants, and i purchased a medium.
other I love the style and quality of this skirt. the material is a bit heavier than anticipated, so it works well in cooler months, and the thickness makes it easy to wear a shirt underneath. it fits true to size - my usual 6 is form-fitting without being overly snug or pulled.i am on the taller side, and the skirt is fairly long - it comes to the bottom of my knee.
other I have been looking for a black dress for a few events i have coming up this winter and have not been able to find anything suitable! i have tried a few things from free people but being 5'8", everything there is just too short for these particular events. when i saw this dress, i had to have it! it has the same feel as some of the free people dresses but the length is so much better! the dress itself is sheer and not intended for extended outdoor wear, but really beautiful on. dress up with som
other Much nicer in person -- the chunky knit reads more gray with black accents than "blue" as described here. there are lovely flecks of rust, blue, goldenrod, green throughout. super soft, stretchy; it's fine sizing down...otherwise the arm holes dip down very low. i'm usually a size 4/small and xs was best for me (33" bust, long torso, broad shoulders). i can see wearing another layer underneath when cold weather sets in.
other The previous reviewer was right on with her review, including that the shirt is a bit darker in color irl. i'm writing this review to emphasize how large this shirt runs. i'm typically a small in shirts, usually a other and occasionally a 6 if it's a very fitted style. i'm 5'5", 125lbs, 34b, and i went with the xs in this, and it is huge on me. i really like it though, so i'm considering reordering in an xxs, i've never worn an xxs. i'm starting to get frustrated with inconsistent sizing, especially
other Adorable skirt but fit is definitely too tight like the other reviews before me  i am super petite other 1other 10other pounds the double zero and zero were just a little tight for me and a little too long ( both could fit around my waist which is a 2other but high waisted and tight not a fit around the hips) if  the length had been above the knee i might have kept  the zero but they were both returned  great skirt in the theory  with the wrong  waste fit and length
other Given that i am petite with thighs (take a size 6p or 28p) these were not for me! the run small, are really tight from the thigh up, run longer that a petite should and are fairly thin. on top of that the zipper and hook in the back are really inconvenient. i was looking for something i could wear to work, and these were not the right style for that. plus they seemed cheaply made, like they wouldn't stand the test of time. i imagine if you are tall and skinny like the model, they would look good
other I love this tee shirt. i love the higher neckline and the feminine and subtle ruffle at the bottom. it is my favorite tee by far! i am buying my second round of it now. i have one in coral, light blue and i am ordering more. the only down side is that both of my current shirts developed holes veyr quickly.; one on the shoulder and the other in the usual belly area that comes from the granite counter and jeans top button. there is no excuse for the shoulder holes in my mind...but i love the look
other This is one of my favorite pieces. simple, classy, and cozy!
other I am usually drawn to more color but the vertical and horizontal lines of this dress made me curious. the fit is absolutely incredible! i like the fact that it is very easy to put on without any zippers or buttons as well. it hugs your body in all the right places. i had no issue with the dress riding up and the way the designer placed the lines makes this one even more flattering. gorgeous dress!!
other This cute top fits great. it's got a nice fit on arms, shoulders, and bust, then flares out a bit to give ease to the tummy area. the back has a cute button trim and solid blue inset. cute top!
other Love! i always used to wear skinny jeans until i discovered these!!! highly recommend. they elongate your legs and curve in just the right places. super flattering! plus, they are extremely comfortable. however, i'm other ft other inches and i have to wear a good other inch heel with them!
other Beautiful. elegant. sexy. i love the fit. can be dressed up or wear with jeans. it's great!
other These tights are wonderful, exactly as pictured (but the shimmer is more apparent in person), definitely true to size, and super comfy! the only tricky part is finding the right shoes to pair with.
other I ordered two of these in orange as holiday gifts this year. both were loved! great style and quality will hopefully make this a go-to sweater for both recipients.
other I love this dress. colors are great, but a little tight in the chest and arms. i am 5' 8" and usually wear a size 6. i bought the medium because i like a little looser fit on top. the arm holes are a little large which makes reaching up for things awkward.
other Great sweater. cozy and thick. the bands at the waist and wrists help keep this sweater in place. the loopy knitted fabric adds a bit of texture to the gray which makes it a little more exciting than your average gray sweater. i got a small and it fit perfectly.
other This dress is thin and completely see through. it is definitely not worth the price tag. would be really cute in a thicker material.
other I bought a pair of these a month ago and first time i washed them they came out with light spots all down the leg. i figured i did something wrong so i bought another pair in the same color and one in sage. just washed both pairs according to care instructions (no spills, stain remover, or anything but detergent) and both came out with light spots all down the leg. very sad to have wasted all that money.
other I love this dress! i generally wear size 10 and the medium fits perfect. i'm a curvy lady and this dress fits great. i've received many compliments on it and might even get another pattern because i love it so much!
other Great with a tank top underneath and jeans. i also wore with a delicate gold necklace. charming!
other The dress didn't look like much on the hanger but the rust color caught my attention so i tried. the dress fits beautifully. i did have to size down to a small because the medium was too large on my frame. i have a longer torso and the elastic waist did not quite fall on my natural waist, but corrected by pairing with an obi belt, which looks fantastic. the bottom is lined and flows rather nicely. the dress has a modified hi/low thing going where the front and back are longer than the sides, but
other I was a little nervous to purchase this top as there were no previous reviews. but it intrigued me- especially with the sale price! i love it! i am 5' 6" and got the small. it hits just at/below my knee in the front and a few inches above my ankle in the back. it is perfect with a pair of skinny jeans or leggings. what makes it go from a frumpy tunic to a cute flowy top is the slits up the side. a beautiful touch! the neck is very high- almost a cross between a turtle neck and a hooded look. i l
other I was really disappointed in the shirt. the blue embroidery is a lot darker than what is shown in the photo, and barely stands out against the black. the photo does not accurately depict this shirt. i will be returning.
3 Cute but too thick and rough
other I didn't expect to love this dress.. i assumed it would be something i'd return. this dress is so cute on! i love how well it fit me and that i could dress it up for work with booties, or pumps and a cardigan or dress it down for happy hour or a baby shower. i ordered a small ( i am 5'other and 130 lbs) and it fit me like a glove....good job maeve you did it again!
other Made of casual materials, perfect for drinks or to be used as a vacation top. has a very flattering cut and pretty design with chiffon trim on top.
other This poncho is dreamy. the colors are divine and appear a little bolder in person. there is a gorgeous leather trim around the edges that elevates the look so much. the belt minimizes how big the poncho is and really makes it feminine. its everything you dream of when it comes to a third layer for fall. my only gripe is that the fabric is a little itchy. it being wool i can't say that i'm surprised and the truth is that its heavy enough that you would definitely be wearing long sleeves underneat
other I am always on the hunt for a cute white t-shirt but this one was a miss. it is too boxy (short) and the material is very thin for the price. i gave it two stars because it has nice colors for spring/summer. for reference, i am 5'other and 11other lbs and i ordered a small. bought it online so i ended up returning it to the store.
other These are the perfect higher waisted skinny jeans. high enough that there is no muffin top, but not so high they look like mom jeans. typical ag super soft fabric. they are like wearing sweat pants. so worth the extra money for the ag jeans. love the length too.
other Love this black and white dress. the bottom art print is so nice, i am a sucker for flowers, i also love the cut of it, teh tiered hem is very flatering, not too much amterial. the upper part covers a normal bra, and the whole dress is super flowey, substantial amterial, and stretchy (for those days where you ingest more than itnended). flattering cut (waist being the aame apttern as the bottom, gives it a nice shape). i can't say anything bad about this. regular xs fit me but i would ahve t
other This top was a big disappointment. i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size 16. neither of them fit well, but one was cut much smaller than the other. i've had this problem with all of the numerically-sized buttondown style of maeve tops. i don't understand why in size 1other & 16, this keeps happening. that's why i purchase two of each. usually one fits and the other doesn't. this time, unfortunately, neither worked. they both were too tight in the arms/shoulders
other Maeve has done it again with a fabulous blouse. i bought in the blue motif and the colors are so wonderfully fall. the length is great for skinny jeans and leggings. loved that it covered the rear end as well. i am 5'5", 135lbs, curvy/athletic frame, 34c and the size small fit well.
other Love these pants. love the fit. i can't wait to wear them, but i have to find the time to hem them first. i am kinda tall at 5'9" and i wear a lot of heels, even tall heels. but these pants are even too long for my 3-4" heels, and i don't wear taller than that to work every day. only on very rare occasions. so they do need to be hemmed. they are a great cream white color so can carry on through the winter and will also get a lot of use in the spring and summer. good fabric and a nice fit!
other I have many left of center tees, and this one is a part of that same family. i got the deep purple (kind of an eggplant color), which is perfect for fall. the sleeves are long, the cotton is thick, and i love the small details at the neckline and bottom hem. it's not quite other stars for me, though, because it is very high on the sides--not too much that you can see skin while standing still but enough if you raise your arms. not a deal breaker for me, though.
other I was looking for a flowier top to wear under cardigans, and this is pretty perfect. it is more sheer than i would like, but because i am wearing it as a bottom layer, i'll overlook that. the fit is great and the peplum is a cute detail to make this layering piece a little different.
other Love the shirt. exteemely comfortable, simple and nice.
3 I wanted to love this top- the pink color is wonderful and vibrant. however, like many tops lately, it is short waisted and ended up looking a bit boxy. i am 5'8 and found it about 1-other inches too short.
other Absolutely love the diagonal zipper. it is extremely flattering for the office, and comfortable. a great layering piece with a simple blazer, or alone. looks high quality. my only one minor complaint is that the bottom tends to move away from my body, as the top is wide on the bottom. hence, gives you a lot of leeway in the stomach area. may not be a good thing, or may be a good thing. still, overall, a keeper.
other Really cute piece, but it's huge. i ordered an xxs petite and it was unfortunately extremely wide and not flattering. returning.
other This shirt is so cute! i was unsure about how flowy the sleeves would be- as i'm not one for frills- but the sleeves sit nicely. also, i am between a size small and medium, i got the small and it definitely is flowy. runs big, so if you like a tighter fit you may want to order a size down. i got the red and it's a perfect autumn / winter color. the cut outs are not too showy- so it's not revealing for us gals who are a little more belly-conscious. it's the perfect shirt to just throw on and go a
other I've been on the hunt for flattering cords for a long time, and these fit the bill! bought the silver on friday and am going to order the pink. the silver is really more taupe, as pictured, so if you're looking for true grey, this is not the pair for you. but the fit is fantastic. i'm 5'3" athletic build about 130 lbs and the 27 fits perfectly. finally cords that don't make my muscular thighs look giant!
other This top is such a great color and style. i did have to go a size down, as i typically wear a medium. the style is very forgiving. it looks great with shorts and jeans! it's staple!
other Upon opening this top, i thought for sure it was going to be too s mall, but it stretches nicely and is gorgeous when on. it is a little thin, and you have to be careful that it's not too tight or you can see skin through the knots, but i love this shirt. i got the xs, which is my usual size. i could probably have used the s, but didn't want to pay for shipping to exchange it as i don't have a store anywhere near me and the xs was fine.
other I loved everything about this dress. the fit, the style and the ability to wear in the fall. i wore it once, washed it in gentle/hand-wash cycle, in cold water and laid it out flat to dry- per the instructions- and it shrank at least a full size. it's going back. i am so sad, as i said earlier, i really loved this dress.
3 This is a really cute shirt. i love the design, color and everything about this shirt but the size. i am 5'other and 10other lbs, i can usually wear an xs or xsp. the xs was huge and they were sold out of smaller sizes or i would have ordered one. this unfortunately had to go back.
other Great dress that can be dressed up for work day or even dressed down for a nice weekend day.i have it in black but thinking of buying in the yellow/orange color too.
other I love this dress. it is super cute and comfy. i am 5'7 and a size small, other and 36c and i got this dress in a other and it fits great. a other might be a little more fitted on my waist but the other is comfortable and looks great. the length is perfect, not too short at all.
other Love this one. i usually wear a medium, got this in medium and fits perfectly. i agree with the prior reviewer regarding the arms, they are a little snug, but i like the fit just as is. the pattern and medium thinkness were just what i was looking for.
other I was so excited to see that these were on sale post holidays. love the style and the fit. my only disappointment was that they don't have as much stretch as i thought they would (i wrote above that it "runs small" but if it had more stretch then the sizing would be ok). for reference i'm 5'other and 10. i usually wear 2other in pilcro pants but these felt tighter. i would exchange for a 26 but they're sold out unfortunately!
other I had been eyeing this top for awhile so decided to snag it when it went on sale. i'm still on the fence. i love the material and pattern but it is really long, and i'm 5'10". it looks very roomy with jeans but i still want to try it with tights and boots to see if that looks better. overall i think it is a great piece.
other Love this dress but wish the lining was full length - will be removing this liner and using a different slip underneath!
other I wore this suit for the first time yesterday and the black inner lining is leaking and causing stains on the white sections. seriously bummed as this is a super lovely suit.
other The dress is true to size, but has generous stretch to it. i absolutely love this dress, i compliments where needed and hides what needs to be hid, for me the tummy!
other I initially saw this top a few months ago, and fell in love. it ended up selling out in stores, so i ordered it online, where it was back-ordered by a couple of months. i received it this past week, and was sadly disappointed. the design is pretty, but overall the quality is sorely lacking. i wonder if maybe the first batch was good, but when they realized they were so popular, and had more made, the newer batches weren't as good? not sure. the one i got had inconsistent red embroidery, and ther
other I haven't gotten a dress from retailer in a long time that i like as i do this one! this is the old retailer-quality, extras, and unique design! fits like it was made for me-tts, i am 5'5", 14other lbs and the 6 is perfection! no enlarged arm holes or funky fit...it has lining as well as a tu-tu slip underneath so you can create your own fullness in the skirt. it is very fitted at the bust and waist and will hide numerous flaws at the hips. this dress is spectacular so don't wait...press the button!!!!
3 This dress is super cute - and fits tts for retailer. i ordered my usual size small and it fit me great everywhere, however the arms are much shorter and hit me either wrong, or the model in the picture is just very,very small. i'm 5'10, 136#, 36aa, slim built and the dress fits, but the arms bunch up -- if i ordered a medium the entire dress would be too baggy (and it is a loose fitting shift). bummer, bc it is super cute! also, the material is loose crochet - my dress arrived with a pull. sad fa
other Wanted to buy this dress, but the bust area was way too small. as i went up sizes, the torso began to be too long, and i would have to have it altered, i guess. what a shame.but, if you are small chested, then this is your dress.
other This top is adorable; fits like a glove which makes me a little nervous...there were no washing instructions attached so i will hope for the best. the quality of your garments are always excellent; its only the risk of buying on line (sizing) which makes me hold my breath until i can try my order on. it is a joy to get items that fit from retailer, my favorite online store!
3 This dress could have been great but for me there was too much design on the top part/ front. i wish the neckline was different or just less beadwork/ design near my face.all in all its a maxi dress and was returned because approx. $250 was too much to spend on this.
other While this is cozy and well made, the problem lies with the unavoidable exposure of the inside of the poncho, which looks unfinished. had the inside been lined or had the hue of the stripes continued through the material, the draped look of this piece would be gorgeous. unfortunately, the faded backside of the pattern (a glimpse of it under model's left hand), viewable through the very large arm holes (and impossible to hide), disrupts the effortless, fluid feel that a poncho should have. i was
other Purchased this for new years eve and an early january wedding. can't say enough good things about it! the lace fabric is soft with the perfect weight. the style is slimming and flattering. although i am short, i have a full bustline and ordered regular rather than petite and it fits perfectly. pants are very easy to hem if needed.needs very little by way of accessories because the lace edging is so beautiful.other seasons appropriate!
other I like my dresses oversized but this one is ridiculous. it's seriously unflattering. i usually between a m & a l and i got a small and it's still massive. but the slip is tiny. it looks so cute in the picture. but not good in person.
other This socks are very comfortable however they do feel a little big around the top so for people with a small lower calf might find them a bit big. that being said they are very comfortable.
other I would give this top a 4.5. it is a very pretty top, i love the embroidery, but runs a little short for my taste. it still meets past the top of my pants, but barely. this is why i didn't give this top a 5. i am 5'9" so i think for a petite person the length would be perfect.
other I hate buying dresses because i rarely find one that fits well. i'm very petite on top (xsmall) and small/med on bottom, 5'8". usually dresses are tight on my hips & thighs and loose up top. this fairly lightweight yet warm dress is such a winner! form-fitting yet stretchy and forgiving in all the right places. the x-small and small both fit pretty well but i decided to go with the x-small on this one. i think this will be a staple winter/fall dress. loved the fit so much i bought it in the peac
other I purchased the orange version (definitely orange - not red) before heading out on vacation and it was perfect for hot summer weather. the swingy shape keeps you cool and the print is much better in person. the fabric is very soft and hangs well. look forward to wearing to work also with a cardigan. i own a few akemi + akin tops and always get a s. this one seemed a bit large even in s but i liked the length so kept the s.
other I love this with skinny jeans! it is comfortable and soft. it fits well.
other I love this top, it is a very soft material and it looks very classy.. i have worn it with a skirt for work and skinny jeans. i have a bigger bust and i wear a small, it is true to size. very classy!!
other Wow.. love this blazer! it's not as structured as some blazers , but the woven fabric hugs in the right places. fantastic addition and great alternative to the good'ol black blazer.. great versatility work to play. nice weight for fall, but will also do well for my fl winter. it's longer than some of my other blazers, but i like it.. with the front pockets as they are, it makes for a unique design that gets noticed. i got the size other and i have broad shoulders for someone @ 135lbs.. makes for a n
other Was looking for the perfect birthday dress....and i found it! gorgeous! i generally wear a size 0 or other but opted for a size other to give some wiggle room and it still fit me like a glove.
other This is online exclusive so i ordered both sizes xs and s. it runs pretty large so i kept size xs. the material can be stretched. but i like the feeling of it and very comfortable to your skin. i am so happy receiving so many compliments wherever i go!!!
3 I bought the red and white. both tank tops were a nice, thick material- definitely high quality. i was hoping there would just be a little bit of swing at the bottom, just enough to be loose and flattering. but there is a ton of extra fabric at the end, which with a larger bust wound up edging into looking a little maternity. but i think it'd be great on you if you tend to do well with very drapey or swingy tops. it runs a touch big- im normally between a small and an xs, and the xs was not even
other I tried on the dress that was returned at my store in xxs p, i would not have based on reviews but my stylist asked me to try it on. it does look nice, you just have to cinch it all the way. perhaps most people do need to size down. for my 11other lbs, 30dd, 26.5in waist, i wouldn't go up to xs p... to give an idea. material is nice and sturdy. give ti a try!
other Super cute retro styling and i adore the pattern however i had some fit issues that were worth noting. i tried the standard 6 on at my local store but the bodice was so tight on my 3other b chest. i was determined to get this lovely summer frock and had the sa order an 8p to be shipped to me. i'm currently taking my 8p for a spin today but only after some alterations: even through the dress was quite large in the bust, there was still the dreaded button gaping so i added other snaps in between some of t
other I know it's for warm weather, but i am more excited to use as a layering piece for fall/ winter. i bought other sizes a other & 6, because i wasn't sure on size. the 6 was way big on me, but the boxy cut of the other left enough room for a shirt or light sweater underneath.
other This is such a nice little sweater to add to a dress or tank. fits true to size and i love the tie and hook and eye closure. quality.
3 This dress would have been perfect in a medium petite. beautiful dress, wish i had sized down
3 Loved the look of this top. sadly it runs quite small and was very tight where other non-swing tops in a large do not. the item ran out of stock far too quickly. i normally wear a large but feared that the large would be small and wanted to order up but it was already put of stock. the quality and style are great especially for a larger chest. length is great for taller women.
other I just got this top in store today. all the colors were "heathered ", pretty casual colors. the top is extremely soft and i would say true to size. love the flutter sleeves that give nice feminine details.  i hope it doesn't shrink in the wash and wears well! also, i found that the purple color seemed to run slightly smaller than the others? kind of odd, but i thought worth mentioning:)
other Very cute dress for 5'other or taller
other I got the top in green, it is very soft and comfy. it does flare out a little if you wear it untucked but looks really cute tucked into jeans or a skirt.
other I was really drawn to this burgundy color on this sweater, but wasn't all that impressed with the style. as soon i tried it on, wow it is very flattering. the color is gorgeous, i can see myself using it with jeans, pencil skirts, pants. for reference it does run large, i am usually a x large but i got a large and fits beautifully.
other Loved this blouse the moment i tried it on! it is one of "those" items for me. it does run large so size down. if you are concerned about the arms don't be. i usually go between a medium and large and the medium was perfectly roomy without being to large.
other I bought this dress for work and post work happy hours. love it! it's material is high quality and is flattering since it falls nicely on my postpartum figure. it's a little shorter than i thought but still appropriate for work.
other I anticipated receiving this skirt as i love a longer pencil skirt and this looks beautiful. i opened it, tried it on, sent it back...it is well made but has too many negatives. first, it is very thick. i ordered size 6 (5'2", 140 lbs.). the size was good, but it is so thick that it adds lots of extra fluff around the waist and abdomen. it is also very stretchy and fits in an unflattering way. finally, and most importantly, it has a back and front vent and both are vented all the way up to the c
other Was looking for a top with this style. i ordered this top wondering if it would fit in the hip area after reading the size chart (it showed a close fit.) the answer is yes! there's room to spare, which is a good thing. i like the nubby front material and the hemline's asymmetrical style. i'll be layering this top with sweaters and jackets all winter. very soft feeling fabric. wouldn't mind another one in a different color!
other I fell in love with this dress as soon as i saw it. it does fit more loosely than i typically prefer, but the colors and the patterns have such personality that it didn't matter. i wear mine both as a dress and with leggings for the windy days. this is one of my new favorites!
other This top is too cute and shows just the right amount of skin without being overt. it can be worn on or off the shoulder and is just enough to cover a tummy without looking maternity. i can't wait for the warmer weather to get here and stay so i can wear this top more often!
other Great long cardigan! i wear this with a simple tank
other I love everything by cloth & stone so was excited to see that they made a dress. hooray! i ordered it in the xl, which is my usual size in their shirts. when i tried it on i was so sad to see that it barely fit around my tummy and hips! i am a true size 12/1other and the xl just barely gave me enough room to move. my chest also caused the dreaded "button gape." it is clear that they cut the dress for people with a stick straight figure. so disappointing!!
3 This is such a cute top with so much potential, soft fabric, vibrant colors and flattering fit on top. however like so many of retailer swing tops lately it has tons of fabric at the bottom making it billow in a very unflattering way. i ordered it in an xxsp so i can't even go down in size so this top, regrettably, has to go back.i love swing tops but retailer, could we please have tops that do not double for maternity tops??
3 I'm obsessed with this skirt and was so excited when it came in the mail. i ordered a m, and it was massive! i'm 5'9 and typically wear a 6 or an 8. as i don't really have much of a waist/am built more like a column, i wanted it to sit right at my waist/right under my ribs. wanted to wear a crop top with it, but it fell down to my hips which made me look significantly larger. the quality is amazing, and the skirt is even better looking in person! worth ordering in a size down and getting it tail
other Super cute! very light and flowy. i ordered the black. packs well wasn't wrinkly when i took it out of the suitcase.i ordered the black. so happy with my purchase.
3 This dress is beautiful. very vibrant and rich looking...however, after wearing it to work the back of the dress was completely stretched out from sitting in my office chair. when i stood up a little bubble remained around my butt. not attractive. i wanted to love it but it's going back.
other I love the bright red color and also the texture of fabric. it's light, soft and crisp, which is perfect for summer days. the dress is definitely designed for people with a short torso. the waste line is a bit high for me, but overall it didn't feel weird or look funny. there is just something about this dress that made me very difficult to part with. once i tried it on, i had to bring it home with me!
3 I like the feel, stretch and softness of this dress, it's very comfortable. sadly, as others have commented, the armhole openings are just too long causing the dress to fit and look a little off around the chest area on me. i considered sizing down to a 4, but it fit beautifully other than the armhole area. unfortunately it will have to go back. i am 5'7",120 lbs, 34d and ordered a 6.
other I had been eyeing this top for awhile and decided to get it when it went on sale. it is a very nice top. i'm going to pair it with jeans and boots for our florida fall but could see it working with a nice pair of pants. it is roomy so if you're looking for something more fitted than i would pass on this top.
other Love this shirt, the material the design... but....i have not worn it yet... the side openings are strategically placed to show my least flattening angles, if you know what i mean. i will be sewing these two openings and hope the shirt still looks and fits beautiful.
other Pants are overpriced and very uncomfortable. to my utter dismay i wore them during a business trip for the first time and ended up with bruises caused by the side zipper. i have been a long time retailer shopper and usually my go to store, however,ending up with a pair of pants that caused me pain was a very big disappointment,
other Usually wear stevie jeans from ag but wanted to try something different. now i love farrah!
other Coat is very soft and comfortable. runs large; usually wear an xsp, could have gone with an xxsp, if it came in that size. the lining is very soft. can wear a sweater or something heavier underneath, if needed.some small, little pulls on outside fabric, but, might be part of the fabric. outside fabric is very soft. would not have paid full price; glad it was on sale, as i had been eyeing it for some time. it is cute, and felt like twirling, when put it on!
other Runs small. great quality. haven't washed it yet, but guessing it will shrink if i dry it. awesome texture- waffle knit. i got the stripe. it has a removable palm tree pin!
other I wanted to love this top -- looks so comfy and cute. but hangs like a bag. going back!
other This dress definitely runs large, so i ordered it through my local store, in order to get a size that would fit. i ordered one size down, but could have gone down 2. i love the embroidered design. i just wore the dress to a slovak festival, yesterday, and it fit right in :-) very comfortable, and fun to wear.
other This is a beautiful light weight sweater. great for the texas weather. the red is a great color for the holidays too.
other When i tell people i invested in a "horse sweater" i don't get a lot of encouraging comments, but when they see it they understand. so cute, different, and cozy for cold days (winter is long where i live). really works as both a sweater and as a coat.
other I was obsessed with this dress/jumpsuit after i read all the great reviews, even tho i had never seen it in person. it was already on sale and sold out online, so i called a bunch of stores and finally was able to track one down in the navy colorway in my size (it's tts). so glad i made the effort! it's as great as everyone says it is. i love how it's "party in the back." i'm 5'3" so it was pretty much floor length on me.
other I ordered this for the colors, and modern geometric design. colors are as shown. a beautiful combination that works well with blue jeans, and my burgundy flats. it's casual and soft enough to wear all day. i wore it to the beach, then out to dinner the same evening! oh... i spilled red wine on it at the beach, and couldn't wash it until the next day. i used dawn dish detergent and hydrogen peroxide on the spots, then laundered in the washer on hot and they came out, completely. i air dried, and
other This is so beautiful! i loved it online, but it's even prettier in person. it's a little greener than it appears in the photo. the straps are actually a green rather than white. i'm 5' 6'' 123 lbs and the xs fits perfectly. worth the money!
other I wanted to love this sweater. the photo of the model makes it look so soft and warm. i liked the heavy texture and the extra long sleeves. however, after receiving this sweater i tried it on for less than other minute. one look in the mirror was enough to make me take it off and return it asap. the knit quickly expanding from small to large right over the bust, combined with the boxy shape was an atrocious combo. it must have added 30lbs to my physique and made my bust look matronly. yikes! this ma
other I like the shirtsleeves for south florida and the material. the design is great too. hits high up on my waist which i like. i ordered the black, but had to send it back as the medium was too big. i usually take a medium, but the small fits perfect. like white a lot and ordered the gold too.
other I am normally a straightforward 10 - since i saw the other review i ordered down to an 8 - i am still swimming in it.i would say i have about other inches of extra fabric in the waist/hips. this is sized way too large. i love the softness of the checkers but i suspect this could get itchy fast on the arms where it touches the wool - but i won't find out cause i'm returning it?on the bright side i might fit a 6 which would be pretty nice.
other I at first only intended to try this jacket on and get a feel for the fit and style, as i've been looking for spring/fall in-between weather outerwear. but i unexpectedly (and maybe unfortunately for my bank account) fell in love instantly. the fabric is very soft, and the cut is cute, stylish, and flattering. the quality seems good, and the fit is perfect. i ordered an xs regular in the moss color.
other My favorite pants, casual and a bit dressier by changing my top. comfortable, classic, well made
other I got the floral suit and honestly, it's the most beautiful bathing suit i have ever owned. i have yet to wear it to the pool or beach so i don't know how it holds up when getting wet. i can see where other reviewers have said there is no support in the chest. it is padded which is nice, but no underwire or anything to hold the girls up. if you are big chested this could be an issue - not so much for me. :) looking forward to wearing this suit when the weather gets warmer!
other This dress is absolutely lovely, from the neckline to the fabric. really feels like a well made dress. i will say that it ran larger than i thought though, so keep that in mind. it is more of a shift dress than the pictures suggest. still gorgeous though!
other An absolutely gorgeous, but poorly fitting blouse. the bottom part is way too billowy and inconsistent with the fitted top half. got it on sale and still returned it.
other I was so bummed when this came in...the colors and print are beautiful, but the neck is super itchy because of an elastic/ruffle combo. there is also a liner which is a nice touch, but it's significantly shorter than the top layer which drove me nuts. definitely going back.
3 Great cut and fit. tts. size 6 fit my 5'5", 13other pound frame (34b/c bust) wonderfully. my sister and best friend loved it on. but i'm returning. the color is more of a very bright orange than red. i would want to wear this in the middle of summer but the all-polyester fabric is hot. i have too many dresses in my closet. cute as it is, i'd just never pick this one. love to see this design in lighter fabric and different color options. 1-2" longer would also be a slightly better length.
other I got this dress in the mail today, and it's one of the best dresses i've ever gotten at retailer.. the material is of high quality and feels silky against the skin. the fit is true to size for maeve, and is so flattering. for reference, i'm thin (116 lbs), but curvy and usually order a regular xs. in maeve, i'm usually an xsp, and the xsp fit perfectly. it looks good with a wide cream colored crocheted belt (also from retailer), or on its own.
other This dress is absolutely hideous on my physique. ordered a size 6 and it hung on me like a cheaply made tent. i have an athletic built am a 34d. it is going back asap.
3 I purchased these on sale and am only keeping them because they were such a low price. i ordered the other petite, but they do not actually seem to be made for a petite person. they are still very long (to my ankles) and the legs are very wide. the waist fits fine though.
other They look good in the front as well the back i would go a size down in them though as they stretch out throughout the day! i love hei hei and would recommend this pant
other I wanted to love this shirt, but was very disappointed. i had read other reviews and still ordered, but wish i would have listened. the shirt looks nothing like photos online and is extremely boxy and unflattering. had to send it back.
other Love this casual and soft flowing top. its a nice loose fit. slightly big, however i'm petite. asymmetrical hem adds a unique touch. pairs well with a variety of denim skinnies...black, dark denim. planning to try with white ankle skinnies as well. the v-neck is just right. dips enough to show the neckline without revealing cleavage. it's the perfect lightweight layer for spring to fall. i even added a black blazer for a cool evening out. love this top and would buy in other colors.
other I tried on the refgular xs and it fit, btu the cut was wring on me, i moved up the dress as though it was cut "petite" and what a difference! i will ahve to roder the petite for sure.te material is a thicker knit, very strectchy and warm enough to carry the dress through winter and spring.the shoulders are well covered, in a flattering way. the chest area is crossed over "open", not stiched close, so yo ucan adjsut as needed. te "tie" jsut falls but is attached to the dress on one side, so it
other Cute and comfy shirt! tts- got my usual m (i'm a 10) and it has a generous fit but i think it's supposed to. it's actually a silver grey color.
other I am not usually one for super girly tops, but i could not resist this top. the material is beautiful and this top can definitely be dressed up or dressed down, i think it is extremely versatile. it is a little bit see-through but if you just wear a nude bra it's perfect! i usually wear a 00 or 0 but i got a other in this top because it is a little tight in the sleeves/across the shoulders. but if you size up you should be perfect! super cute and i definitely recommend you get before it sells out!
other I love this sweater and the sleeves are amazing. i also love the purple color, which is more of a deep maroon. the material seems to be of good quality. what i don't love about this sweater is the shape. it is very swingy, which is somewhat flattering because it isn't too clingy, but it poofs out a bit too much on the sides, becoming unflattering from certain angles.
other Even on sale sale...this tank is not worth the money. the design in the back is adorable & would expect it to be so much better quality but the fabric is flimsy(think old man white tanks that come in a pack) completely see through and lack of shape..i wanted to love this but definitely photographed significantly better than actuality!
other I bought the calia tunic in blk/wht and in red motif. i love the black and white one. the cut is flattering and stylish. comfortable. you can dress it up or down. all good. the red motif is cut differently. the neckline is very low. the shape is different from the black and white one. i am not sure why but i returned it.neither shirt is as long as the one pictured on the model. i would recommend the black and white one though.
other Great top. i got the size other but i ordered a 6 and plan to return the other depending on how the 6 fits. the top is really cute but it fits just right and i would like a little more room. when i raise my hands the entire shirt raises up. otherwise cannot wait to wear it and this is a great purchase.
other The first day i wore this dress to work i was amazed by how many people commented on it! i knew i liked it but apparently so does everyone else!
other I have a number of sweaters from moth, and they never disappoint. the ones made with this ultra soft and warm yarn are my favorite. i bought both colors :) i wear it with jeans or dressier clothes-- i'd say it's very versatile.
3 I saw this dress in the store months ago and never forgot it, so when i saw it on sale i nabbed it online. so sad to see how this dress fits: just right up top, just right along the hem, and then it's a hot, potato-sack-frump mess in the middle. it's a shame because the fabric is beautiful.
other A great wrap dress with many buttons, the dress stays on better than any other wrap dress i ever owned.
other This skirt is great to wear to work. nice medium weight. being cotton, it doesn't get to hot. skirt is lined. nice flattering shape. my normal size other fit perfect. love the godets. comfortable. doesn't get all wrinkled from sitting. nice royal blue color.
3 Definitely size down, the waist and chest were baggy in my normal size s.
3 This a heavy cotton which is great for fall. design is cute and pockets are interesting. the fit is boxy and can look bulky. i only recommend if it's on sale.
other I stumbled upon this vest in my local store and i'm so happy i did. i was looking for a classic staple that will be on trend but pass into classic season after season. i wore this with a black 3/other sleeve top, dark skinny jeans and black booties....perfect look for most seasons in dallas. so happy about this purchase!
other These pants are so comfortable and i love the color, but they did not work for me.
3 This dress looks so beautiful on the model and i couldn't resist ordering it on-line. i have an athletic build -- read small hips -- straight. i'm 5'5' and 13other lbs. i was very disappointed when i put on. it's made for a curvy build. the dress was just too big, especially around the hips. i think this dress is probably beautiful on a curvier build!
other Loving this top! the material is lovely and high quality plus the design is very flattering on body. perfect for cooler evenings out. did i mention super flattering?
other This dress turned out to be a huge disappointment!!! i was in loveee with the picture! in real life, not so much. the material felt thin and cheap! and the yellow was super yellow! nothing like the picture. i was so bummed! returned it earlier today...
other Yes,you need these, so comfortable - and wash up perfectly - workout, walking or great to sleep in
other This was my first mother denim purchase and i've already gotten another color. love the feel of this denim. it's heavy enough to smooth out any imperfections and manages to stay tight (not stretch out) while being comfortable. this color is perfect too. so flattering. love!!
3 I purchased this dress to wear to a beach wedding. i loved the color, the fit and the style. i even got a lot of compliments on it. the problem was that the wedding was on the beach, in florida 8other degree weather and when you are sweating the fabric changes colors and takes a really really long time to return to normal! unfortunately i had to return it. would be great to wear indoors, just watch getting water or anything else on it!
other This is a very pretty blouse and i like the mix of fabrics. i bought this in my usual size and it fit nicely except for the fact it is much too long. i have a short torso, and all this does it just cling and sit on my butt. perhaps this would work very nicely on someone that was athletic or tall and slender. sad to say, i had to return this because of the length.
other I wish this fit me better. i love the inside fur. it is extremely soft but it doesn't look flattering at all. it makes my shoulders look really broad and it was shorter in the length than i wanted. it wanted it fit over my butt (or cover half) and it sits a little below my waist. unfortunately i am taking it back. great idea though.
other I agree with the other reviewer that the green is brighter in person, which was a happy mishap. the 8p makes this look just like depicted on me in terms of proportion, so beware that this borders on too long for petites. my not small chest made me look pregnant, but it fit well regardless. adding a wide belt made this dress look amazing on me and shortens it to a more flattering length. this is a miracle as-is because i'm very short-waisted. keeper!
other This jacket is as cute as it looks in the picture, color is very close too. i normally wear a 4-6 top (sometimes s sometimes m). the small looked great until i tried to raise my arms - the cut runs a bit small acrossed the back). i love this jacket though! the m fits nicely and i highly recommend it!
other Flattering fitted form. flowing fabric. well made. colors are true to pictures.
other I am going to keep it. i think it will be a great "throw on and go" piece you can wear with many different types of shoe/sandal. the detail on top is excellent and it is a flattering cut. two complaints: runs a little big on bottom, a little "genie" looking...like there is too much fabric above the elastic around your upper ankles. but the bigger issue is that there is no zipper or elastic on top so slipping the top over your shoulders is super tight, to the point i thought i was going to rip it
other A flattering soft basic! i'm 5'2" 120 lbs and purchased the small on sale.
other I wanted to love this sweater and it has some nice distinctive features that make it more interesting than your average cardigan. unfortunately, however, i found that flared in an unflattering manner over my stomach. the chest fit well - though it was very low cut - but then if i buttoned the sweater it made me look like at least three sizes larger.the quality seemed okay, but a bit thin and i was afraid that this would not hold up for long.
other I was so excited for this dress to come. i am 5&#39;1&quot; and 100lbs so i ordered and xs petite. it was literally falling down around my shoulders and gigantic all around. maybe on someone taller this would have looked great. i was also disappointed that the blue shown online was not accurate. my dress was a much lighter blue. back to the store it goes.
other These are really cute and done in a substantial knit type fabric that drapes well and doesn't cling. i ordered my normal size large. so i'd say they're true to size. the leg isn't too wide and bells out nicely toward the bottom. the color variations are striking but on me they made me look wider than i am. i'm short and the hem hit at the top of my ankle instead of the cropped look shown. think they'd look best with shorter tops. i decided to return but still highly recommend.
other These are great. they fit tts - i'm a 26 in most denim brands & that's the size i got. the material has some give but doesn't stretch out. the color is not super white so you can actually wear them in the colder weather season as well. at 5'4", they were a little longer on me than shown on the model. i find them very comfortable.
3 It's okay for a coverup or beach dress and lounging around the house. it's comfy and i like the detail of the back. the front is very plain but okay. it's not too baggy and it's a straight cut. the detail in the back makes it a keeper for me but only as a casual dress too chill at home or quick errands to grocery store.
3 This shirt runs large. i ordered it before it was sold in stores so i didn't return it. the style is really cute. the shirt does pill.
other This sweater is so unique. not for the faint of heart but it's beautiful. hubby thought pattern looked southeast asian inspired. the colors are saturated, vibrant. love the raglan sleeves and the tweed on the sleeves and in the back. the front material is slightly stiffer. i feel like i have a little bit more bulk in the stomach area than i want but i'm willing to overlook it. will be a great sweater for the holiday season. wear it with a skirt, jeans, skinny cargos. endless possibilities.
other Great material, pattern and cut. perfect summer top
other I love all of these dresses, ordered the ivory in 00p on accident, meant to order 0p. was too small, but 0p would have fit. it is flattering, the pattern of lace is great, but i didn't like the color as much in person. i think i would like the blue better.
other This dress is gorgeous! the colors are deep and rich and the fabric is super soft. the top part is lined but still avoids feeling like it would be too hot when the temperatures warm up. bonus-- a regular bra works perfectly underneath without anything showing, even with the deep v neckline. while the waist does sit a bit high, it works perfectly on my body-- emphasizes the smallest part of my waist and then flows away. it drapes nicely, not too full and not too clingy. i am 5'7 and a true size 6
other I saw this dress at my local retailer and passed it the first time. one week later, i stopped by and skimmed through the store and went back to the dress...and decided to try it on. boy oh boy! i grabbed a small and a medium (i usually wear a medium) and the small fit perfectly! the fabric is thick and feels so soft and nice. i love the pockets! worth the splurge and like the other reviewer said- it's not maternity like at all. i plan to wear it with brown boots or brown heels.
other I love this sweater. i bought it in black and love the way the back falls gently and flatters my figure. i'm curvy on bottom w/ a butt and tummy so i like to cover them but i don't want to look like i'm wearing a moo-moo. this top looks chic. it's the right shape to flow gently. it's just the right detail to be different in an understated way. i wear it w/ leggings and jeggings because it falls low enough to cover my butt. neckline is good-- i'm a 34b and it's flattering. not sure if it will fla
3 I bought this dress to wear to my low-key backyard rehearsal dinner. the dress it's self is beautiful, good quality, and a perfect summer maxi. however, it was way too big. i'm 5'6, 118 lbs, i typically wear an xs/0 and felt like i was swimming in fabric. i loved the style and make of the dress, so i choose to get it tailored.
other This dress is navy and neutral stripes. not black and white. it fits true to the size width wise but is 2-3 inches shorter than the picture. to gain the length you might want to size up but it will be wider. the knot at the hip is beautiful and very flattering.
other If you love the boho style then this too is for you. it is very pretty and pairs well with skinny jeans, leggings, sandals, boots, and booties.  i bought it in the orange color which is more of a burnt orange which is perfect for fall. it does run big which is the style so you could size down and still have room to hide flaws. for reference i'm 5'3 and bought the pm but needed the ps. i have recievied tons of compliments and i'm thinking of getting the silver one too!
other Love the tegan tunic version of this dress. i assumed since it looked identical except for the length that the sizing was the same but i was wrong. this runs so big! i got a s in the tegan but the s in this dress looked like an oversized potato sack on. i highly recommend ordering at least other sizes down unless you want to look tent-y.
other Such a pretty fall sweater. nice fit. wore it once out shopping and it snagged :( had to return, sadly.
other Not at all tapered at waist as suggested here by photos. i have wide shoulders and am slim, and this made me look big all around. i am doubtful a smaller size would correct this- i am 5'10" and ordered a medium. also, it curls under a bit at the waist. one nice thing about the cream is that it is not see through. anyway, i purchased this to go with high waisted skirts but am returning.
3 I love the look of this dress and the material - the problem is that when i tried it on the fit was a bit off. it seems that the arm holes hung down way too much and pulled the dress so it is uncomfortable to wear. i don't think i could have gone down or up a size to make this dress work. it is a shame because i really liked the look of it.
other Super comfy and longer than last year's version minus the hood. love it!
other After reading the other reviews, i felt compelled to write one for this top. it is not often that i get to shop at an retailer store, but a few weeks ago, i had the pleasure. i saw this top, and while it was not on sale, i had to have it. yes, it is sheer and so you do need a camisole under it. the gold and silver embroidery is gorgeous. to be honest, this is my favorite top in my closet right now. i can dress it up or make it more casual. and, now that it's on sale, don't hesitate in this purchas
other I absolutely love the color, cut and style of this maxi. the high neck and drop waist are both so flattering! the color and design is gorgeous as you'd expect from rana gill. i got my normal size 8 and it was perfect. i would have expected the fabric to be a little heavier but it works as a late summer early fall dress
other Bought both colors - nice quality top, but they do run large. for reference, i'm 5'4", 115lbs and xs is still kind of big on me. wish they have xxs.
other Order at least one size down or the double v neckline will insist on slipping off your shoulders. everything else about this top is great.
other This dress is cute!! i ordered my regular xs which was too large but liked it enough to exchange for an xs petite and hopefully the fit will be better. (the xs was much too wide and came past my knee. i'm 5'2' and 123 for reference).  the grey is very pretty and is blueish gray... very misty and unique. the pockets are awesome and i like that it's lined in a fine poly that shouldn't cling to tights, etc in the winter. if you can find a size that fits you, buy it!
other Dress runs a little small, tight on top. so i had to exchange from a size 8 to a size 10. originally ordered a petite but petite wasnt available in the 10 so i will probably have to get altered for an extra expense. the material is light and soft, flowers are muted. maybe would of prefered a little sleeve but design is so cute.
other I bought this top in the gray color and my usual size large.   the fit is perfect.  i don't have the tight neck issue that another reviewer had.  there is an odd knitted neck that you can't see on the model since her hair covers it.  i love the softness, fit, and embroidery of the top, but was debating on returning because of that weird, stiff neck knitting.  my husband said that he really liked it, so i gave it a shot.  i'm wearing it right now and it's super comfortable. i don't notice the nec
other Was in my local retailer today and just had to try this on! it appeared to be a structured jacket, but it is actually a sweater-jacket! gives a very "chanel" vibe and looks so chic. i plan on wearing it with just about everything. i would probably wear it open most times, but i love the closure with the button detail. i am large busted, but petite, 119 lbs., 5'2", and this was way more flattering on me than most jackets. normally, the sleeves are too long, but these were just right! i am sure i wi
other Ordered this in white and the peachy color- the armholes were gaping. not well designed. i don't recommend this tee at all.
other I order this sweater in black - size small - and i just love it. i'm a slender 5' 9" 130 lbs and the small is perfect in for me. while it has the classic cardigan look and a slightly oversized "boyfriend" feel to it, the rounded front hem, hip pockets, and buttons that end slightly above the bottom hem (where the rounded hem begins) are unique touches i appreciate and love in retailer's clothing. the weight was slightly heavier than i expected and better quality, but it is perfect for my minneapol
other This skirt is very comfortable and fits tts or even runs a bit large. i was able to dress it up with a great white shirt and statement necklace. great find.
3 Too floppy; light and comfortable material but the tie-neck needs a shirt with a bit more structure.
other Well, it's the snails that really make this cardigan special. the buttons and the open work stitching are nice too, and the fabric is soft and warm. a note on the sizing though - the style runs short in the torso and long on sleeves. so if you are petite like me and considering buying the regular size because the petite is sold out - you'll be fine with the torso length but will have to roll or scrunch up the sleeves. that's not too bad because the fabric is soft and easy to push up at the sleev
other I love this skirt. i was happy with the quality of the fabric and style. i originally ordered a small, but returned and exchanged for a medium, which fits great. (i typically wear a size 6-8 in pants). i look forward to wearing this skirt to work this fall.
3 I was really excited about this romper and when it arrived it looks just like the picture. the torso was abnormally long and i get this is supposed to be a relaxed fit but it sagged way too much for my liking. i'm 5'9", 32c and i wear 28 size pants, usually i struggle with too short of a torso in romper/jumpsuits but not this one. i ordered a medium and felt like it was way too big. i probably could have gone down a size but i wasn't loving it enough to try. the fabric is nice but the tiny clasp
other This is my second pair of pilcro jeans and the second time i am totally impressed. these jeans have a comfortable stretch and rugged wash that is trendy & fun. they are the perfect everyday jean and look great casually with a pair of birkenstocks or converse low tops. the only thing worth pointing out is that i am pretty short (5'4) and the regular length fits me perfectly. this may be an issue for ladies lucky enough to have some extra inches on me.
other These pants are so comfy and perfectly casual without being sloppy. they're the perfect summer pants.
3 I can usually be counted on to love a pretty top with lace detail and a bit of flow. this one has those qualities but it does not look great on me. perhaps it is too flowy because i am 5?3. or possibly the fabric is too soft a look on me. i did size down as reviewers suggested. maybe one size was not enough :-). i must return it.
other It's a bit baggy (i'm normally a 6/8 medium but went with the small here). i debated for a while but finally went for it on sale and i'm so glad. the colors are just gorgeous in person. delicate stitching on the shoulders adds a feminine touch. great with my jean jacket which gathers up the extra material just right. looks great with summer sandals and booties for fall. i love love love this dress!
other I love this dress! i spotted it in the store yesterday right before walking out. i almost missed it! i'm so glad that i didn't because this dress is super cute. the fit is nice too. not too short. the fringe detailing is very cool. i cannot wait to wear this dress this spring/summer. casual enough for flip flops, but could also be dressed up with some cute wedge sandals.
other I love the ruching on this hoodie, which is why i ordered it. i'm typically a size small, 34b, 130lbs but the hoodie was a bit tight in the waist and around the bottom band. i might order it in a medium (although the sleeves will likely be too long) the only thing that makes me hesitate is the color. it's more of a brown gray (instead of just gray as you see on your computer screen.).
other This pjs are adorable!! they run tts and are extremely comfortable!
other Mom loves these and she looks great going to the gym! the cut-outs are so cute!
other Great fit and style. i got the navy and the color is beautiful.
other First off - i love these jeans... they are the exact look i have been searching for, and the bands around the hem are what really sold me on this specific pair. the only problem - which i found with a previous purchase - is that they hit me at the ankle, rather than what is pictured. since i liked everything about these jeans, i decided to so with plan b and had them altered to be about an inch shorter. this involved cutting the hem at the top of the bands and reattaching... the stitching blends
other This is the best item i have gotten form retailer. the quality is amazing. soft, covers my butt, classic piece!!!
other Simple pull-on pant with a great design. they look flattering on and can easily be dressed up. i wear between a other and 6 and the small fit perfect. i have washed them and worn them several times and they still seem good as new. the wide elastic waistband ensures that they stay in place.
other Love this piece. can be worn casual or fancy. runs slightly big, but that seems to be the style. size down if you are in between sizes. the color is unique and organic. really comfortable and fun fabric.
other Good quality tank. very flowy and longer if you are short.
other I know that some folks said it runs small, but i am usually a size small or medium in dresses and the medium feels big to me. that being said, it definitely works, and i think it'll be great. excited to dress it up with accessories- feels professional enough for me to teach in.
other I was on the fence about this toposition because, as others have stated, it is quite billowy at the bottom. just before returning i decided to try it on with a navy linen v-neck cardi and it completely changed my mind!! wow! now i am not saying that this isn't beautiful on its own, because.it truly is!! i am just saying that now this has become a truly versatile piece in my wardrobe. i did not order a petite even though i am 5'3", and for that in am glad! i ordered regular size xs (108 lbs/36b)
other I love everything about this dress. the sleeve and bodice detail make this dress exceptional. the fit is true to size. i ordered medium. the length is as it appears on the model- just below the knee. the material is of great quality and the slip lining is made of a nice stretchy knit.
other I haven't worn jeans in a year because i felt uncomfortable and constrained. these are as soft as my leggings. they have so much stretch, you could do yoga in them. if you want the jean look w/o the stiffness/structure, get these. flattering to the booty too.
other I love this top. the wine color is beautiful, the fabric is soft, the details are pretty, and it fits perfectly. it is long, and will likely look best with leggings or skinny pants and boots.
other Bought this in xs petite - i'm 5'2", 102, it was too big, so took it to a tailor. altered it so that horizontal stitching at the bottom sits gently on my hips, rather than floating way out all around. it's now nice and flattering; i get tons of compliments. note that the fabric is more off white, than bright white; i bought it online thinking it would look good with white jeans - it actually looks best with blue jeans or navy shorts/pants. drapes nicely and doesn't wrinkle. a win!
other I absolutely love this tee! i normally don't buy two of the same thing, but i bought it in both black and mauve during a december sale. i ordered a size small, and it fits tts. it can be worn with leggings or skinny jeans/cords. i love pairing it with skinny jeans and boots best. it's very slimming and so soft.
other Love everything about it but had to get a size bigger to be long an off/ to short for a mom. if i was 20 would be fine.
other I had high hopes for this top. i love the plaid and design but found it too boxy and short. the front was cut too low as well.
3 This top is very light and soft for summer. even the lace is soft. it's not sheer and doesn't require layering. true to size. i'm 5'4", 34dd, 150 lbs- m fits well. my arms are not tiny and yet the lace weren't tight for me. but the quality of the material is average and it feels like it will last barely one summer. it's good if you are paying the sale price.
other Fit, length and design were perfect. i took this skirt on a recent business trip and it transitioned perfectly from meetings to cocktail with an accessory change.
3 Love everything about this skirt but the sizing. i'm a size 6/medium in almost everything but this skirt swallowed me. i wise there was a small or even extra small to try out. i'm also 5'other and the skirt was right at my knees. definitely size down if you want it to look like the pictures.
other Material is awful. not soft at all. colors are much darker than shows online. it is actually very short not at all as it looks on the model. it went back.
other I was looking for something to wear for an event at an art gallery. i actually really loved this dress! i think it hides body flaws. i tired on the xs, but the small was a little more flowing. it was comfortable and very fun to wear.. i am short, so the length was great for me i wore a different full length black slip under it which was more comfortable for me. go try it on too see if it fits for your body style. it was great for me
other I am 5"7" and weigh 123 lbs. i tried on both these dresses in medium, and they both fit. they are not too thin, not too high slit, not scratchy. the problem is i am middle aged with a thick waist. the waist looked lumpy with the close fit knit. if you are younger, slim and tall, you will love it. i sent it back with regrets. hope this helps.
other I was pleasantly surprised by this dress. it goes perfectly from work to drinks and i receive tons of compliments on it. i pair it with a thin belt and heels or booties depending on the occasion. i ordered a small, it is a little big, but the fabric is stretchy (i am 5'4" 125lbs). this dress accentuates my upper half, while disguising my lower half--thanks, dress!
other Love this top for casual days. fits perfectly, fabric feels quality and color is bright but not too bright. good length, just touches top of my thighs.
other Great fit, the fabric is supple and of good quality; has a fasionable look to it but is also very very comfortable. can't beat that!
other I tried this on in the store and was sad that the small was a little unflattering around my mid section.  couldn't stop thinking about the dress though, so checked reviews online from home...many said to size up. i ordered a medium and it is perfect! fits so nicely now and the fabric is so cozy!! i thought the top would be too big in a larger size but it still looks good.
other I just bought this and really think it is a great dress! it is conservative, and i will be able to wear it to teach or play the organ at my church. i am a church organist and college professor and need conservative clothes, yet i do not like to look "frumpy." this is cute and chic, yet conservative. also j got 25% because it is black friday. thank you retailer!!!
other I just purchased this cute top at my local retailer store and definetely the size is way off! in blouses i wear a size 6 (small or medium) with a 34b bust, tall and slender and i had to purchase a size 1other (what????).overall so cute and could not pass it up. good luck. try it on before purchasing.
other This top is so cute, but it is massively babydoll shaped (a- line) which is not apparent from the pictures. i measured the xs i have and the chest is about 42" and sweep is over 70". i would definitely keep this top if it hung straighter. the craftsmanship is lovely and fabric is so natural and handwoven looking. i'm thinking about asking my tailor if she can take the sides in, but that might ruin it as the fabric layout is cut and proportioned to this swing style.
other I loved the idea behind this shirt but it just hangs around the waist with tons of extra fabric. i suspect the model in the photo has the shirt pinned. totally unflattering making the chest look small and your midsection appear huge. maybe if you size down it would be better- xs was not available for me to try. also the lavender color is really washed out...
3 Adorable top, but i have to agree with what two other reviewers said... that is is boxy and unflattering. i have a similar patterned top, also by maeve, but the sizing on that runs small, medium, large. the s petite that i have doesn't fit quite the same as the other petite in this blouse. this is definitely more "square" in the torso, and the ruffles do stick out more - very flouncy. it just made me look frumpy instead of the sexy date night look i was going for. i am 5' and 120 lbs. also, i didn't
other Love this top. have two of them. they are comfy, light-weight and extremely flattering. love!
other So much extra fabric. not something i would recommend buying online.
other I bought the blue in store and loved it so much that my hubby recommended i buy the raspberry online! i usually buy a medium in tops, but went with the small so it wouldn't be so flowy. fabric is soft and not itchy. i will be wearing these a lot this fall!
other I absolutely love this dress. it is very body conscious, but has some "give" to it. the sleeves and lines are beautiful. very well constructed... sexy without being overtly so. i find it very elegant
3 I ordered this in an xs, which is my normal size in retailer tops. the stitching and detail on the straps is beautiful, but they were also somewhat tight across my bust and across my back. it puckered in a strange way that wasn't flattering. back it goes, unfortunately.
other This dress is so comfortable and looks so good. i love the low back and the swing in the skirt. i ordered the tangerine, which is really more red than orange. this is a simple, slip-on dress, perfect for traveling as it doesn't wrinkle. i will wear this often when the warm weather arrives.
3 I was looking for a basic tee, but this one was just ok...the quality is okay, but it us not as soft as i would have liked. unfortunately,  i will be returning this item.
3 This top was quite voluminous when i purchased it and i sized down to an xs, however after hand washing it once in cold water it has shrunk significantly. it still fits, but something to be aware of.
3 I know this is supposed to be a loose, flowy fit which is exactly the style i love. however, this is beyond tent-like. i'm 40 weeks pregnant and i can probably fit two of me in my normal size small. fabric is very thin and pattern looks like drab wallpaper. huge bummer, especially after seeing a few 5-stars.
other I tried hard to make this work because it is beautiful, but ended up returning it. first, it is very delicate material - i was terrified trying it on. second, i just couldn't make the drawstring work for me to achieve the fit i wanted. third, it was too low for me and would need a cami over the slip. while i didn't think the colors were as deep as the picture, it was still pretty. i could have possibly gone down a size to fix some of my concerns, but then i know it would have been too short for
3 I purchased this dress online and it just didn't fit my body very well. it also arrived with a pretty sizeable hole so i can't say that i'm impressed with the quality. there were other areas too where was a loose thread which i'm sure will develop into another hole eventually. returned.
3 I saw these in my local retailer and loved them on the hanger. when i tried them on, not so much. the material is a pretty substantial white denim and very stretchy (i didn't find them to be that smooth of a fabric, but more of a traditional denim texture). i am a 6-8 in pants, and normally wear a 27 in pilcro denim. when i tried on the size 27 in the store, i found them to be very tight in the thighs - and i don't have big thighs. i also found the pants to pull conspicuously across the crotch are
other The other reviews seemed promising and so i ordered these in a 10 petite. i am 5'4" and the length was still long and would either need to be worn with a heel or altered. the length was not what made me send them back though. the quality is very very nice and the fabric thick, stretchy and well made. however, the body hugging fit and flare make these look exactly like a yoga pant but made from nice material. if i were a bit more confident to wear these outside of the gym then they would be great
3 There is a lot of fabric here! the legs fit me fine, but they are long and when you roll them up it creates a bunching of fabric in an awkward area. i've also found that they don't stay rolled up in the back, especially if you sit down. it's a shame since the fabric is soft and comfortable. maybe sizing down would've helped, but i doubt that would've fixed the problem of the cuffs staying rolled up.
other I never noticed this sweater online but when i saw it in the store, it was love at first sight. i agree with other reviewers that the color description is odd. the brown is a very pale gray and the blue is a light mint green. the sweater is very delicate looking and fits true to size. the sleeves are very long, covering my hands, and i have long arms. it does have enough body to make a large roll at the cuff. i do have a couple of issues that aren't related specifically to this sweater: even tho
other The petite was a little bit long on me (i'm 5'2), but it otherwise fits true to size and is very soft and comfortable, breezy. covers enough that it is work appropriate or for something outside. a keeper!
other Let me start by saying i was not in the market for a new dress. i bought this because it was retailer day and because in my seasoned experience as an online shopper this many positive reviews is rare so i'd better listen up. and because i really like the other bailey 4other dress i own. wow! i am glad i made the impulse decision to buy this. i love it, my husband loves it and it's comfy. for reference i did size down and went with a petite. had i not i think the dress would look on me like it does on
other Simply lovely to look at because of the fringe detail and it's a joy to wear because it does not cling to my trouble spots.  very versatile as it can be worn and layered in many different ways.  i was lucky enough to buy this in petite but i'm sure the regular would've been fine.  looking forward to outfitting this because i got so much inspiration from instagram.
other First time trying pilcro, but glad i did. these shorts are extremely soft and comfortable without being too short. love love!
other Great tank top! loved it so much that i ordered 3!
other I wasn't sure about this top online. in the picture, it sort of looks like it juts out after the tie. but the reviews said it was really soft and flattering on. i wasn't sure exactly how the sizing translated (numbers vs letters), so i ventured into the store. i am normally either an xxs or xs in most retailer tops. i went with size 2. i think i would have been ok in the 0, but it might have gotten a bit snug in the shoulder area sizing down. and with the front tie, it can be cinched in to create
other This dress is great if you're very skinny and have no chest. otherwise, it makes you look dowdy. the colors are also quite washed out and do nothing for my complexion.this one is going back.
other I saw this classic beauty on a mannequin with black trousers, and it looks gorgeous so i went back to try it on! looks better on vs on the tablei have broad shoulders and the small worked
other I got the black in size small. i love this easy, breezy and comfy t. i love that it's different and can wear with anything. the shirt is more flowy vs fitted which i like. i wish they had more colors! i could see myself wearing this shirt a lot this summer. i'm a size other and bought a small.
other 1. i'm 5'5" tall, 14other lbs, and 38-32-40 and the pilcro hyphen chinos and stet chinos fit me perfectly, if a bit loose in the size 30. the size 30 in this flare pant was snug in the hips and waist and loose in the thighs and legs. i could not tuck a shirt in.2. the front pockets with the leather trim are sewn shut. i'm fine with this, as it keeps the pockets aligned properly. however, there are still pockets on the inside incase you want to unpick all the stitching that's keeping the pocket clo
other I love this shirt! the colors are more muted in the photos, so i was a little surprised to see how bright some of the colors were. still super cute! also has a looser fit--i'm a small across brands (5'7", 130, straight/slender build), so if you prefer a more true or tighter fit, size down. either way, get this!!!!
other This is a lovely jacket. it is easily paired with different bottoms and tops, and is such a fun take on the standard blazer with the beautiful ruffle pocket-detail. they are not actual pockets though, which i thought would have been an easy thing to incorporate. my chief issue with the fit is that it is a tad boxy. i am a standard xs/xxs and this runs just a tad big and a bit wide. but unbuttoned it falls seamlessly. if you use the clasp, it actually looks bigger. regardless, i love it and was o
other Just bought the patterned and gray. the small fit perfect. i do have a short torso though. chest size 32dd. i tried the medium but then the underarm portion was too wide. i might have gotten a medium petite but small petite would have been too small i think. i hope the quality holds up which was the only thing i wasn't sure of. great summer tank to throw on with jeans or shorts.
3 I'm 5'7", 13other lbs, slender bone structure. the medium fit well in the front but hung to the back of knees in back...just way too long. it would work best on someone closer to 6' tall.
other I love how the white and beige were not see through and actually very forgiving to people with cellulite. love love the fit. highly recommend. i'm always a 30 but in these i even fit into the 29. i would say if you're in between, size down. i love the fit so much that i got the beige and white. highly recommend. hit at my ankle for me at 5'6
other This is one of the best purchases i've ever made... i have had the black for over a year, and every time i wear it, i receive so many complements. i've dressed it up with a striped scooped back shirt, or a fitted sweater, and paired it with flannel with a belt... i love it. i'm 6' ft and slender, and the xs it hits me at the perfect length just below the knee. i recently ordered the silver in a small (it's a little big in the waist- but nothing a corset belt can't help) for nye. love this dress!
other I've been searching high and low for a pair of flattering and comfortable linen pants. i'm very particular and have turned down every pair until these. these are perfect! they fit true to size. they are a relaxed, but not baggy cut. (i hate saggy butt pants!) the legs are slightly tapered so they don't widen my frame. they look great rolled up or left down. the linen is soft, not scratchy. the elastic band sits comfortably on my waist. they are also not see through! (a must for me!) i ordered th
other This sweater is so soft and warm and i love it with the matching leggings. i say it is true to size, however i ordered it a size up so that it covers the bottom/crotch area when i am wearing the leggings. normally wear an xs, ordered a small and it works well. it is very well made. i absolutely love it!
other I love everything about this dress! i love the colors - style and fit. it is so comfortable. i had so many people ask where i got it. i usually wear an xs or s in retailerpolgy dresses and i got this in an xs and it was perfect.
other Obsessed with this sweatshirt! it's a must have for any loungewear lover. i'm normally a xs but sized up to a s for a more loose, relaxed look. i was afraid it would swallow me, but i love the fit! the knot in the front is a nice detail that makes this comfy top really cute. the fabric is a great texture, great for transitioning from summer to fall and winter to spring. love everything about this sweatshirt and will easily pair with leggings or jeans. worth every penny!!!
other Love love love this blouse the cut outs at the top just add to it's elegance
other Saying that these pants are comfortable would be redundant. they are over & above in comfort. i wear a size 8; and they are right on in sizing. i want to comment on the color/print. to see the green, i had to take the pants by a window with natural light and look closely. that being said, i think the pants take on the color of top one chooses. i walked through my closet with the pants in hand. they match with light grey, periwinkle blue, light sky blue, navy, white, your choice. i do prefer a so
other I like this dress very much. the colors are great and the style cute and casual. its perfect with a pair of cognac riding boots and tights.it really is depicted well in the model photo, although i think it may be cut somewhat shorter than it appears in the photo. i am 5'9" and its shorter on me than on the model who, i imagine, is taller than me.the dress is made of a substantial, tight knit material. i found it to be a bit boxy so i washed and tumble dried it, hoping to tighten it up a bit. t
other I love this dress. it fits like a dream and is incredibly flattering. i vary between a other and a 6 in dresses, and the 6 was too large on the bust but the other fit great! the dress is longer than in the picture, the model must be wearing heels, but it doesn't quite hit the ground with flats. the fabric is light and airy, it comes across a little more formal in person but is versatile enough to be worn more casually as well.
other These are soft and skim the body the way well fitted undergarments should. they do not pinch, bind, or ride up. they coordinate perfectly with the matching bra. i am very pleased with this purchase.
other I am an retailer employee, i love this romper and suggested it to several of my regular ladies the day it arrived in our store. they both loved the piece before they tried it on...the jumpsuit is so cute and has the special flair of a piece you would expect to find at retailer. the piece is lined which is an added bonus but there is where the issue with the jumpsuit arrives. the lining is to short makes it feel awkward. i ordered the xxs petite, and it fits perfect, except the inside l
other I tried both the xs and s in the store. i am usually an xs, but ended up buying the s, because the xs was really short and i didn't want it to be any shorter after washing. the s fit more like a normal t-shirt, although the back is longer. love the color (blue) and the fabric is super soft. also happy that it's not too thin, nor see-through.
other I'm so disappointed this dress didn't work out! i ordered the size medium, post baby i'm a solid dress size 6 or 8 depending on the designer.the cashier was laughing with me how ridiculously huge this garment was when i held it up. also the length was super long, description says 35" which would be mid thigh for me, but this thing hit me mid knee. also, like the previous review the shoulders are tented and poofy. so bizarre and the cut reminds me of a maternity dress, but the shoulders def
other I ordered this top in the solid navy. the quality seemed very good, and my overall impression was favorable. what i liked was that the top stayed off the shoulders even when i was moving. so many of the on-trend "cold shoulder" tops simply do not stay put with even the slightest movement. unfortunately, this top ran quite a bit large. if you are in between sizes - i definitely recommend sizing down. i've not seen the printed floral option, but the dark navy is lovely and looks chic with white bo
other I am a solid size 6 in most brands, top and bottom, 5'3" tall, 125#. i have long legs, short torso, and fairly broad shoulders - i almost never wear petite sizes.however, this top in the regular small size could be a maternity dress on me! i am literally swimming in it, and it is quite long. however, i can still make it work, with a cami underneath and leggings or skinny jeans... i like it, did not return, and will buy another color, but will go with petite x-small in the future.
other I have the pink plaid pippa and this mint one is nothing like it, but in a good way.  shorter, sweet embroidery but the same swing silhouette and drop waist style.  this dress is a little oversized so if you want more fitted look, you can size down.  stay tts if your busty like me.  imo, the mint looks more sky blue than green.  i got the medium regular and i'm 5'3" 140# 36dd and ends at my knees.
other I'm 5'7" 155lbs and ordered a large. it fit, but the arms were awkwardly short. the finish details on the end of each sleeve almost would have to be pushed back to the elbow for it to look right, which would be okay. however, the interior seam of the neckline is cut jaggedly and isn't even finished with any stitching. it's just tucked haphazardly inside the neckline and isn't sewn--it would unravel with washing. it's soft and snuggly and cute if you get it on super-sale and don't mind it com
other These are excellent. as previous reviewers noted, they are a thin material, and there isn't much stretch. that being said, they have a casual, work-appropriate men's wear vibe (the extra fabric in the crotch region contributing to this). if you really don't like the extra fabric, wearing them a little higher and closer to the natural waist should solve the problem. the navy is a little lighter in person than on the site, just fyi--it's less easy to mistake for black, which is alright in my book.
other This shirt ran small and was more sheer than i expected. had to send it back.
other I love this blazer because it feels like a sweater but has the formal structure of a blazer. great for fall!
other This sweater is a pretty color and style and is really soft and comfortable - i really wanted it to work. a small fit my 5'7", 140 lb frame well (32dd) but the ruffles on the hips were not a wanted addition unfortunately. . tried it on three separate times to try to change my mind but in the end, it's going back. i would not suggest it if you have an athletic or hourglass figure with even a little hip.
other I received this in the mail a few days ago, and was so pleased with it except that it was huge! i am normally a 10/1other in most things so i ordered a large. i was swimming in it in all areas - shoulders and bust bothered me most because i need a waist on shirts so i don't look larger than i am. i liked it enough to o ahead and order a size down. i ordered a medium and medium petite because the top is quite long and i think i could get away with wearing it with leggings or tights if i were looking
3 I wish i could keep this dress based on the pretty orange print and style but the fabric and details make this a return, even on sale price :( agree with previous reviews: bodice too tight, neckline too high/chokes, fabric is rough, outer is poorly attached to liner so it poofs in weird areas. too bad...so sad!
other These shirts are fantastic; lightweight sleeves for summer wear. i go back and forth between xs and small, (i have broad shoulders) and ordered one of each. i like both. the shirt has give so the xs is fine but the variation in size gives the two shirts very different looks.the color is fantastic and true to the photos! not always the case with online purchasing so i loved that.
other Was pleasantly surprised at house nice this too was! the colors are beautiful.  the top is  flowy and drapes nicely.  true to size. i'm a 4/6 and ordered a small.
other The sweater is a great fit and the styling is very original and wonderful. it will be great with leggings, jeans, or even a straight skirt. i would definitely recommend this sweater.
other I bought this top in pink today and it is a beautiful bright pink spring color. i did have to size down from my normal size six all the way down to a other due to armholes being being too big. i tend to have a chronic problems with armholes being big so not sure others may find the same problem however i typically size down to a other when armholes too big. plenty of room in body still but i lost some length. i do have a short torso so can get a way with this. aside from my armhole problem it is a gorge
other Love, love, love this piece! very flowy, but made of good material. glad i purchased this item!
other This is a tts basic tee with the added flare of the ruffled back peplum and the elegance of the beaded front neckline. the beading is lovely and mine was intact. i bought my normal small based on reviews and the fit was perfect. (34-b) the beige color is a classic neutral and can be worn year round by just adding a jacket or sweater. love it!
other I purchased the navy breton stripe version of this shirt. it's chic, versatile, and soft, a great rendition of a wardrobe classic.
other But the back of it, by the waist, bunches just a tiny bit. if i get bigger, it will be too long. but i love the skirt, it is flattering and cute. not itchy for me even if the title says wool. i ordered the 00p and the length is pretty much as pictured, just below the knee in front. the waist is snug, bigger it would fall more on my hips (hence the too long comment earlier. (11other lbs, 26-27 in waist, short legs...)
other The fabric is soft and the colors are bright. it fits well over the shoulders and the neckline is placed just right on the chest. the bottom portion of the tank is more of a swing style item than a form fitting tank. i am very pleased with the top and will wear it often.
other I am usually an xsp or 0p but i ordered up one size (2p) due to previous reviews complaining about the tight slip. however i definitely did not need to size up. the slip is fine and the outer 'shell' is billowy and i should have stuck with my usual size! when i put it on i was not in love due to the dress being so roomy, but a second check in the mirror showed that the fabric / seams draped well and it overall looked pretty cute. it hits about other inches above my knees and therefore seems pretty p
other I think of tracy reese as running small, and usually size up, but the 8 was the only size left so i grabbed it and it fits perfectly. i got a million compliments on it and got rid of my other jumpsuits because this one is perfection. please note that if you are busty it will show cleavage, so you need the right bra.
other I have been shopping at retailer for years and this is my first review - that is how much i love this dress!it is so incredibly comfortable. it is like wearing a cozy blanket. you guys, it twirls. :) i never received as many compliments on an outfit as i do when i wear this dress. (i bought the orange one). i am plus size and i don't wear a whole lot of knee length dresses. dresses in general are hard to find because they don't fit right so i was thrilled to find this. i am also thrilled that it
other This is a cute swing top. tts but generous. best thing about it- the color. i got purple and it is so pretty and saturated. i think it'll look great with big gold hoop earrings. alone or under a cardigan or denim jacket. i'd consider other colors at sale price.
other The length on these are great. they stretch but so far they don't stretch out. the material is a dark and soft. i am 5'6' and 135lbs. the size 26 fit great.
other I got the blue & it is so cute! i'm a very consistent 2-other & i ordered a size 6 & that fit well. the a-line does stick out farther than it shows in the photos so i'm having that taken in some...looked like a triangle. it's definitely worth the price & super flattering!
other I got this in the red. it is a muted color that is very pretty. i am 5'5", and it is neither too long nor too short. it is a nice, light weight. the quality is good and on par with other purchases from this brand.
other I reserve my other star reviews for products that are made well, are a good value and have great style. this is one of those rare gems!the top is just beautiful in person. very lightweight, almost voile-like cotton, so soft and drapey (and yes, you will need a base layer, it's meant to be very sheer) and the crochet and lace insets all over the top are stunning. the fit is somewhere between tts and slightly oversized, but the shoulders are pretty tts which means it avoids looking like you're
other The fabric is breathtaking, both the jewel tone colors and the burnt velvet that would flatter any skin tone. as usual, eva franco clothes run small so i went up a size, size regular 6 (i am 5ft2in, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips) fit well, the hem is below my knees, appropriate for work. but i think it would look better as a skirt or a sheath dress. the top part looks strange, does not enhance any curve and turns the dress to frumpy on short folks like me, thus one star off.
other Dress is nice but can't be worn without tights or you are at a risk of indecently exposing yourself. it is around 30" in length so is more of a tunic than a dress. i'm only 5'other and it was too short . can't imagine anyone taller even trying to wear this !
other Sorry, but i disagree with a previous reviewer who wrote that this buttondown is sheer and runs large. as for sizing, i purchased my usual size small. the fit is intended to be a bit slouchy, and it fits perfectly through the shoulders and the bust. love the high/low hemline, and the back isn't too tight across my bum. i'll also note that i'm 57 years of age and might tend to be a little more modest when it comes to sheer fabrics. the see-through factor is not an issue with this buttondown. i'm
other I worry when i have an elastic waist, or something that resembles this, but the dress hangs like a dream.no puffing out, no gathers that you can see.it is not sheath, but not a line either, kind of in between, hits several inches above my knees, but perfect with some black tights for winter. i saw the note about grey, have to try it on agin in daylight, but i would say think black on the top, light camel color on the bottomi am 5'8, typically wear a size 12, and it was true to size for methe
other Love this shirt, very flattering fit on my pear shape. also accommodates my larger 32dd bust without straining on the buttons. ever so slightly sheer fabric, but no cami needed if wearing a nude bra.
other I ordered this in a large and its a super cute dress but this time the large ran super big! i usually wear a 10 so sometimes mediums are too small. i'm going to exchange it for a medium and see if that fits better. the beading detail is beautiful but just had too much fabric down below.
other Nice lines and texture but fit is very tight and i experienced the sizing to run small. i am 5'6" and 115# with small frame. i usually wear xs or s from retailer, so ordered the turtleneck in small. the size small was super tight. i love the design so exchanging my order for a medium.
other I saw the xxs petite in green in my store, adn decided to try this on only becasue it was a petite and in the store. i don't see green as an option nline anymore, so it must have been a old return... it is extremely soft, as others mentioned, and the fit is really flaterring. i bought it then read abou the rebviews, so will see... the fact that i bought the xxs, means it must run big!
other Lightweight warm in cold nice as a day jacket. works well as a casual coat. very soft but a little wooly. it's really nice color. thinking about buying another. i got the dark one.
other In theory, this dress was perfect for me. the colors, the embroidery, the sheer top and keyhole back... so romantic! sigh. something about the fit just kept it from being a wow moment. i'm usually 10-12, the 1other was way too big, the 10 more fitted, but still it wasn't quite right. the sheer part dips quite low, and sizing down helped, but it could still be a lil dangerous. i kept feeling like it wasn't defining my waist enough and wanted a tighter waist and more full skirt. maybe i would have fel
other Runs large. very boxy. white fabric on lower portion of the shirt extremely thin. it did not look as good as in in picture. very disappointing!
other This sweater/tunic is very poor quality - the seams looked like they were about to come apart as soon as i got it. and, without a chunky statement necklace, it looks like your grandmothers apron. there just isn't any style to it - has to go back.
other I loved the cut and style of this shirt, so was very disappointed when i put it on and it was very tight and slightly see-through. if you do order it, get it in a size larger.
other The waistband is reminiscent of yoga pants except looser. i think these pants are a little large and wide-legged. i have a bigger butt and i like my pants on the looser side overall so maybe that is why they were super loose on me. i think they are a great way to get away with wearing casual pants when you need to dress up. i feel like they would look best on a taller person. i need to get them hemmed.
other I've been trying on "boyfriend" jeans for more than a year, finally found a pair that fit and were comfortable. many of them had no stretch at all and were very uncomfortable. these have just enough stretch, but not too much. i usually wear a 29-30, tried on the 29 which were comfortable but too loose at the waist. the 28 were a perfect fit.i'm 5'8", 140lbs.
other This is probably one of the best retailer purchases i have ever made! this is the most comfy and warm cardigan and is a good thickness for fall and winter. i am 5'9, a size 6/8 and the medium was perfect! buy this now!!
3 This skirt and top is nothing like the picture. the skirt is black not maroon. top is also black. although the skirt is nice, the image was fabulous. the side panels of the skirt are also a knit. quality is good but skirt is overpriced for what it is. would have expected suede or leather panels for the money. not sure if going to keep or not. was really looking for the maroon color instead of the black.
other Love the shape of this top. i bought in white and a friend bought in the neutral pink. we both required a tank/cami to layer under it. i am 5'5", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and ordered a size small.
other Loved the colors (greenish, coal and white) and shirt texture but the fit was horrible. i sized up to an xl because you can never tell sizing with this line. that didn't help. it fit, although a bit long but the deal breaker was that i looked huge from the side view. since i carry my weight in my mid section, high/low cuts on the side are tricky on my frame. it fit well in the bust over my 34g's and looked nice from the front. i do recommend it. if you have my body issues you might pass.
other Saw this in store and knew i gotta have it! beautiful colors and slimming effect.
other When i opened the package i knew i was in love. the colors are vibrant-true to the photo. the fabric is delicious, soft and silky, the perfect weight for a warm summer day. these can be dressed up or down. i am 5'9" 140lbs. i bought the medium and they fit with plenty of room.i would highly reccomend these shorts-just gorgeous! come on summer!
other Cozy slouchy sweater. very versatile. fits tts, just as shown on model.
other I love this dress, and on sale it's a total steal. it's true to size, and beyond comfortable! i live in az so i can easily wear this year round. i got the black color and love it. i'm 5'4" and it hits a little above my knees. love the loose, feminine swing. i feel like skipping wearing this dress :)
other I got the size wrong, and the right size was ot available - so sad! i really loved this.
other Love the fabric, print, and cut! it's a smidge low in the neckline, but that's probably because i'm busty. nice and breezy for our blazing hot and humid florida summers.
3 This top is very nice. i ordered it in black, it looked very good. the embroidery and pleated details give it a very nice look. the fabric, however, feels like heavy cotton. it didn't feel very soft and comfortable, it was a bit hard for me to wear because i usually prefer soft cotton. while i think this will retain it's shape and not stretch like softer cotton, i am sending it back. it felt a bit heavy to wear.
other I am 5'6" and 140b, i'm usually a s and that is the size i bought. i loved the fit of the top and wore it immediately. then i washed it just as the instructions said and the liner shrunk about 3" (just as another reviewer stated) and the sleeves were much tighter and a little shorter. however, i loved the top so much that i took the top back to the store and exchanged. the store was super understanding about it and i was able to order the same size. it's back ordered, but once i get the new top
other These crops are very well proportioned and fun. the graphic pattern is spot on trend and the unusual silhouette can spice up your pants options.i am a fan of cartonnier and these particular pants were surprisingly generously cut in comparison to most of the styles i have. i usually need to order cropped pants in tall, but these worked with the regular inseam.
other This sweater is very comfortable and soft. unlike other reviewer, i did not find the lace to be itchy. i'm 5'4", usually size 6; decided to order medium to give it a nice and relaxing feel. this way i find it to be not too short nor fitted. it's easy and relaxing but the lace makes it a little more dressy. not sure how it's going to handle the wash.
other I am so surprised this was not styled properly in the photo! if worn the way it should be worn it would have sold out before going on sale. yes it is open down each side but you need to slide a belt inside the back so the back is left full and bring the belt out into the front on sides cinching in the front...making this a dramaticly gorgeous piece! i love it and will wear it with my leather jeans to pencil skirt. i am a personal stylist and designer and if you are thinking about this piece jump
other Super cute on.  i love the print and the tie detail and the fact that the tie actually tightened which makes the waste adjustable.    the slip is a tad tight, but it doesn't bother me, its stretchy so it's not uncomfortable.  i bought size xs-i usually wear a other in dresses.  i usually buy petite because of the length but this fell about 2" above the knee on me which is perfect for work so i didn't need the petite.  i am 5'3", 12other lbs.  i loved the soft fabric-fine for year round in southern cal.
other This dress is just beautiful - color, fit, length, style, stretchy fabric...everything about it seems to flatter all body types. it also passes the armhole test - no issues there! the back closure detail adds a little something special to it. i tried it on with black leggings and a black leather jacket just for fun, and it looks surprisingly cute for multi-season wear. is it overpriced? absolutely, but so is 99% of the stuff at retailer. i will be keeping it anyway though because i think it's a tr
3 I ordered this shirt in the purple stripe and was happy when it arrived and i really liked the color and style.   however, like the other reviewer, when i tried it on, the little circles on the front line up perfectly with your bra straps.  i even tried a different style bra and had the same result.  sadly i returned it yesterday.
other This is a bit pricey, but i think the akemi and kin quality is worth the price. this photo is quite inadequate to let you see the gorgeous dye color and floral detail. the sleeves are upturned and tacked; the curvy hem is very flattering, and the designer added a small triangle of cloth at the top of the curvy side, just to add to the careful, custom detail. the 60% cotton/40% modal is deliciously soft. the fine detail in cut, fit, artistic design will make this not simple tee a divine pleasure
other I loved this dress from the moment i saw it! i ordered it immediately, after reading the reviews, and felt confident in my dress size choice...but when it arrived it was big! i am 5'7" 140lbs with an athletic build and i usually wear a 6 or 8 in dresses, so usually a small but sometimes a medium...because if this "in between" that i am, i ordered a small...and it was really too big. so sad...incalled a bunch of stores to try and find an xs but they are sold out everywhere.style is fun and flir
other I kept the size 8 of the dress and had to return the 10 as it was too roomy at the arms and chest (which is great!!!). material is nice and not too much material, hangs nice (its a swing). another win!
other The fabric and cut of the dress is beautiful.  i am writing a review so i can share my experience regarding size. i ordered the dress in size 2, my normal size for this designer. it fit ok but was a little large in the bust area. for reference, i am a 3other a. i i returned it and ordered a size 0, which fits perfectly.
other I love this, despite the split sleeves. the day it arrived i paired it with a black boucle midi skirt (from retailer) jewelry and mid high black slings and we to out to dinner with friends. several people complimented me so it must have looked as i'd hoped. i have worn it one other time with straight legged pants and a cashmere cardigan and felt comfortable and a bit more dressed up than usual slacks, jeans and shirts. it is soft, feminine and comfortable...the ubiquitous "dress it up or dress it
other This shirt is very comfortable. though it's casual, its uneven seams and asymmetry give it a littlemore edge and character. fit is slightly large. i'm 5'5'', 12other lbs and purchased the small. the arms are a little longer than i'd like and the overall fit is slightly too loose. however, it's not a significant enough problem for me to return the shirt.
other Very cozy lounge tee, but runs large. i ordered a small rather than my usual medium and could of probably went down two sizes.
other These pants are perfect!!! they are exactly what i was looking for, and worth every penny! the fabric is more lightweight than any other sort of denim, but still i think i could wear these any season. they look so cute with simple heels and a classic blouse, but they can be dressed down with nice sneakers and a plain white t! so excited to have these in my closet!! love a good pair of fun pants.
other This top looks even better in person! the green is a little brighter than the photo. this beautiful blouse is silk with a sold underlining. it is very full and has great flow and movement. super trendy with the open shoulders and a nice long sleeve for fall. it's really beautiful and perfect for any festive occasion!!
other I loved this skirt on the rack. but it was not lined and super scratchy when worn. i could barely wear it for the length it took to try it on. so sad. such a gorgeous skirt.
other These pants are really cute and comfortable. the fit is very nice.
other This should be a good dress for hourglass figures. runs a bit narrow in the ribcage, so you may want to try a couple of sizes. i'm 5'2", currently 33-25-37 or 38 with a 28" underbust, 28dd/30d/32c bra. normally a 0p or 0 in these type of dresses; the size other fit, not sure i could have zipped a size 0..loved that the boning at the front bust and sides keeps the dress up and in place without the straps. side pockets, and the cotton feels soft, more like a sateen than a poplin weave. lovely colo
other I have only worn this 3 times with no signs of pilling, yet. it is good for cool spring days/evenings. for me, it'll be the cooler 3-seasons sweater. i wear a size large and it fits properly. i have worn lightweight long sleeve knit tees under this with ease in the sleeves. i think a slim sleeved shirt/blouse would work equally well. while i like the idea of the pockets, i think they'll stretch out easily beyond a tissue or quick hand warming. i removed other star due to the high price and i receive
other Great purchase! i bought the coat to wear to work.
other I got tons of compliments when i wore this top out a couple weeks ago. it is a little bit shorter than i thought, and a little bit loose (not "baggy" but just kind of hangs). if you have a larger chest, this may not be super-flattering. the color is really pretty and looked great with dark skinnies. i bought my normal size (after trying on a size down, which was just too short...and i'm 5'2)
other I tried these on in store and purchased them in the chocolate brown as the fit was perfect! i am 5' 8" and weigh 14other pounds with an approximate 10" difference between hips and waist. the size 27 fit perfectly. i was surprised that they did not wrinkle terribly as they are linen. they withstood wear during a very active day and still looked great by evening. they wash well and only needed a quick touch up with the iron. i liked them so well that i ordered a second pair in grey!
other These are more than what i had expected! they're beautiful and fit like a glove. i'm thrilled that i purchased them.
other This is a review of customer service in general,from several issues with online shopping! i don't understand why you ask for my opinion and say it counts when clearly it does not.i have had a lot of issues. receiving parcels from one of your carriers,laser ship and i have reported the issues to them and retailer,but it appears only the good parts are read.this poor service cost me money in postage and lost discounts but again i'm ignored,and i had to order my last returned parcel again pay more fo
other Wish i would have bought them in every color. love
3 I love these leggings - they look and feel great, but i can't wear them out of the house! there is no elastic in the waistband, so they are constantly falling down. i won't dare wear them out, for fear they will fall down when i walk across the street. everything else about the leggings is exactly what i was looking for: style, comfort, and warmth. they are great for curling up to read a good book in front of the fire; not for doing anything active.
other I ordered this dress in the black motif and a petite size. the color is slightly more washed out than depicted probably because of the stretchy fabric used, but it is still nice. the dress does run large. the length is a bit too long and the pockets which i was surprised were even there are several inches too low for my 5'2" frame. overall though, this will be a good dress for hot summer days and should travel well. i wish the blue, floral one was available when i ordered this dress as it looks
other Love these jeans. comfortable fit, doesn't stretch out too much after wearing a few hours. goes with dress up, lazy day or casual tops. my go-to jeans. wish they came in different washes
other This is a great easy to wear summer dress. a denim jacket would look adorable to wear on a cooler night. it runs a bit small in the waist and i bought the petite because i wanted it to be above the knee summer casual. it is very flattering because of the pattern detail by the waist. it is the perfect summer dress and best of all it is machine washable!
other The product looked more or less as expected, but the fabric felt very cheap. not the quality i would expect from retailer. the shirt is also very short, which did not bother me but is something others should be aware of.
other I adore this hooded boiled wool sweatercoat in rich, deep green. quality is great aside from the buttons being sawn on very loosely. it's a great outer layer in the warm northern california fall/winter. i'm wearing it today with a short sleeved boiled wool dress in burgundy for pre-christmas eve cocktails and feeling classy, festive, cozy, and warm.
other I loved this dress the moment i saw it, pre-ordered it, but when it arrived the fit was off. i am almost always a size 4p in retailer clothing, this fit wonderfully everywhere, except the shoulders and chest were very small. i am 5'2" and 120 lb with a small bosom. (a cup) the shoulders were too tight and the chest gaped and sadly i had to return this dress.i may try to find it in the store to try on multiple sizes for the right fit.
other Love these shorts. they do run large, i wear a 29 in pilcro and the 28 in these shorts fit comfortably with a bit of room to spare. the turquoise is definitely green, and not as bright as what i see in the online photo, but still a nice color. they have a funny smell but i'm sure that will wash out.
other I bought two of these in red and taupe. this is a great sweater for those of us who can't wear wool but need to stay warm. the cowl is adjustable with buttons, so not overwhelming even on a small person such as myself (5'2"). the texture is yummy and so are the colors. softness factor is over the top, too. i wish it came in black. have not washed them yet, so can't attest to that feature, but i am very happy with the quality, so far. thanks retailer!!!
other I gave this four stars only because the lining has some polyester (poly/rayon blend) in it and i don't like polyester; still, i couldn't pass it up due to the chic look and the oh so warm feel of the coat. it's like wrapping yourself in a warm blanket and the wine color looks amazing! it's a little on the pricey side. since i consider it more of a sweater than a coat, i would have liked the price better if it was $100 less. it was one of those items that was hard to take off once i put it on. i
other I bought this top in a small and it was true to size. loved that it wasn't too fitted across the back, but was still able to show a bit of body with the drawstring by the waist. it will become a wardrobe staple during the hot months in dallas.
3 This truly is a dress and not a tunic. i normally wear a medium but they were sold out so i thought i would try a l petite. i am only 5'other and the large p was really long. i could definitely wear as a dress with tights. i am hoping it comes back in stock so i can try a medium p. unfortunately it is going back. cute sweater as pictured on the model!
other Purchased in a small. usually a 4-6-8. i layered over a sleeveless dress and i felt amazing. great for those tighter dresses. the fabric is sheer but not super see through. the tassle in the back is so creative. it closes enough in the back to not look weird. i have so many plans for this piece. black is the perfect color too. the collar colors are perfect too.
3 I am sure these pants are right for someone, just not me. i am wider in the hips, and they just were really unflatering. the fabric is very lightweight, which i wasn't expecting, and so while the pleats are interesting, with my hips they ended up hitting in just the wrong place. the waist was also much lower than i expected -- not low rise, but i'm used to thinking high waist with wide legs. in short, these pants are probably great on some body types, just not mine. also very long. i'm 5-8 and a
other Love this top.the fit is perfection!the fabric is wonderfully soft.i ordered the green, love this color.will be ordering it in the grey also..fits very true to size.
other I absolutely love this shirt. it's so easily dressed up and is still really cute just on top of black pants and flats. great for the holiday season too! i am normally a size medium in all tops, i am 5'8'', 150 lbs, athletic-built and the medium is perfect. true to size, definitely recommend!!
other If you are like i am and love coats that stand out......this is for you. there are many +++++++++'s first being the quality, embellishment like this coat has can easily go crafty and this coat does not, also the bead work and trim is sewn beautifully with no loose threads visible to me. it is hard to see the bead work but it pops just right, colors are wonderful and fit is tts. it also,looks great belted and much nicer in person.....
3 I was so excited for this coat when i saw it in the catalog, but disappointed when it got to stores. the faux fur pictured both here and in the catalog looked much more of a burnt red brown color than the straight up maroon that it actually is in store. i'd say it even looks a bit purple. the nice thing is that it is detachable and you can replace it with something else if you really don't like the color. i have decided to buy it anyways because the fit of the coat is lovely and simply stunning.
other I did not like this top at all-but had i looked at the fabric prior to purchasing i would not have. it is polyester-i thought it was cotton so there's the first reason i didn't like it. secondly, there is a piece of fabric behind the laces, presumably for modesty that refuses to lay flat. it wrinkles up behind the lacing, making it appear as if one is wearing an undershirt or cami that is not appropriate for the top. it is too long for me, the top hitting at top of thigh.this top is just reall
other This dress is amazing. i bought it for an afternoon wedding i'm attending, it's perfect! it fits like a glove and the lace is so delicate. the nude sheath really allows the lace and all the details to stand out. love it in the black!
other Although i was worried it wouldn't live up to its sticker price, i'm glad i bought this shirt. it is extremely flattering in the way it drapes. the lace details make it seem dressy and special. the fabric feels luxurious. sleeves are almost too short for my long arms, but they are good enough.
other This is a super cute tank- fits good, flowy and airy which is exactly what i had in mind for summer. fits good.
other This blouse is just so beautiful! but i do love white blouses, so that may influence my enthusiasm. however, once i buttoned it up, it was just dreamy. i have a long torso and am tall for a typical xs, so it's often hard to find something that's the right length. this is perfect! it may overwhelm some ladies who are on the petite side of height, but it's a rare find for me. paired with a pair of cropped pants because i'd come in a dress, it looks delightfully vintage in the best of ways. i'm sti
other I ordered this in two sizes and have only received one so far, but i think i really like it. that said, the one i got weirdly has pockets not shown in the images, which makes it seems more professorial than i'd prefer, partly because i am a professor and don't want to dress like one if i can help it. that said, i really need a floppy, easy cardigan, and this might well be it.
other Love these! i am a medium in shorts or 29-30, and the medium fit perfectly.. true to size, very soft, flattering cut and color. love the embroidery. great for travel, very light and can be jazzed up a little with nice sandals, almost like a flirty little short skirt. the fullness and non fitted look is great for a less than perfect tummy.i am very happy with this purchase.
other Gorgeous colors on lovely silk skirt. longer on me than in photo, but i'm only 5'4". i usually wear a size 1other or 32" waist jeans, but i could not zip up the large. by several inches. i'm not sure if i can possibly cover the waist and still wear it that way. sad because i've had my eye on this for months:(
other Pants fit great. true to size. did not stretch like some of the retailer pants that you need to buy in a smaller size. love that the calf is bigger than most of their pants which are usually too narrow for my bigger calves. very comfy look great with a white shirt and tie die is subtle. they will be a staple summer pair of pants.
other I saw this dress in my local retailer store, and am not sure why i did not try it on then, but later at home it began to haunt me. i loved the colored embroidery against the black. my husband and i will be traveling to europe later this fall and i wanted to take a dress with me that wouldn't take up too much room, and be suitable for times when i wanted to dress-up a little. online i saw that it was available in the petite, and with the reviews warning that it ran large i opted for a medium petite
other As soon as i saw this dress online i loved it and ordered it! unfortunately it just didn't work for me, i tried it in a small, medium and large. for reference i'm 5'2", 145lbs, 36d. the dress is really pretty in person, but i looked like a little girl in it. my daughter who is 4'9", 100lbs, 34a, also tried it on and she too looked like a little girl in it. the material is beautiful along with the detail at the neckline, however the neckline is not open like in the picture, it's more pushed toget
other Unfortunately, does not look anything like in the picture. looks like an oversized house robe. i expected much more but was disappointed. i am definitely returning it.
other Don't know why but i didn't have high expectations for this dress. turns out it's uber flattering! makes my waist look tiny, accentuated bust. perfect for those of us with straight figures looking for a little more curves. bottom half of dress has heavy silky linking. top half unlined and a bit thin. color is almost pearl -- very very light gray. i'm between xs/s (33b-26-36, 5'8" 120lb) and went with a small. hits an inch above knees. sleeves slightly loose through upper arm which is always bett
other I have been searching for the perfect denim jacket and this it! i love the darker color, more modern day less 80s. it runs a little small. i am always either a s or xs at retailer. lately, their clothes seem to be running a little bigger, so i have been an xs in most tops. when i order online, i never know which size to get. i ordered an xs, however it was very tight in the arms and across the shoulders. i wanted to be able to roll the sleeves up, so i returned it for a s and it fits great. i was
other The material on this dress is so soft and wonderfully drapey. super flattering; defines waist enough to not add bulk but also hide a tummy. the purple color is lovely, perfect for fall. for reference, i'm 5'1, 32dd, 118 lbs with hourglass figure.
3 I am 5'4" about 120# with an athletic build. i was so excited for this dress to arrive. when i removed it from the package i loved the way it felt and the weight of it. the color was as pictured on my computer. i ordered the xsp and was concerned it would be too small in the shoulders or too short. it was huge on me -- too long -- too wide -- too frumpy -- too loose all over. i checked to make certain it was a petite that was sent and it was. boo. i do like the cap sleeve better than the flutter
other Very well made and would flatter the right body type. i sized up to a medium (normally size 6), but the front part where the wrap came together did not cover me. the only thing you could see was the grey liner. i'm not sure this one was not sewn incorrectly, or it ran terribly small. i have had success with bailey 4other in the past so maybe this one was just not for me. the quality of the fabric and design are well done.
other This is a gorgeous dress. the print is beautiful and unique, however because it is baggy the dress does run big on smaller frames. i would definitely recommend sizing down.
other This is a basic that i've been looking for for ages. i've never found such a flattering plain white button down shirt before -- everything is either not basic enough, unflattering shape, too masculine, too boring, too wrinkly, or too hard to take care of. this shirt is perfect. it is shaped to flatter, but doesn't have any finicky details. this is just a wardrobe staple, plain and simple. it is going to work hard for me, year round. i have other cloth & stone tops, and have loved them all. their
other I love the idea of this top. it's made really well. the only issue is its a bit shorter than i thought and the neckline rubs on my neck.
other I love this designer and decided to give this one a try. i ordered size large in black. it's a nice weight knit but not too heavy. good for fall and winter. the color is an intense,  saturated black that's really sharp looking. i thought it split up both sides, however, it's only split on one side and then angles across the back to the other side, which isn't split and is shorter.  i carry weight in my midsection, and this flows a bit away from the body but not in a giant oversized way. i like t
other The sweater coat is a must try on! it's a great fall to winter coat, that you can leave on all day if you need. i bought the dark green, which is very dark yet gorgeous and have the beautiful coral saved in my cart as well. i am 5'5", 135lbs, 34c, ordered the size small and have plenty of room (did not want it tight and wanted to be able to wear over thick layers).
3 First, i was surprised that this skirt fabric felt similar to men's tie.  it is a thick weight silky feel.  next, i was surprised by the cut.... i wear a 12/1other petite, and the waist of the large is at least a size 10 if not smaller.  finally, the length was really long.  i realize i am 5'other and buying non-petite sizes, but the cut was high ankle on me. i like the pattern and ruffles of fabric, both are unusual and good for fall/winter.  but i did not like the rest.
other This top is very interesting, has delicate knitting pattern, feels very soft but also very thin. i ordered a purple size large, and it was true to size, but a little shorter in the body than looks, sleeves are long just as other reviewers have mentioned. i am 6ft tall, 160lb and i have long torso & curvy body, so this sweater turned out to be shorter than i hoped but with all that underneath layering it could be manageable. overall look of the sweater is about the same as the photo, the only mat
other This is my first pair of realllly expensive jeans, and they were worth every penny. i love the fit, the distressing, everything about them. they make me feel like i look amazing, which is what good jeans should do! i wear a 3other in pilcro jeans, but based on some reviews went up to a 3other in these and they are perfect. also, i'm 5'6 but the crop length hits at my ankle, which is perfect.
other For the last two years, i have only purchased clothing for myself if it is secondhand, but then i saw this skirt and succumbed to temptation. first of all, the print is gorgeous! i'm a sucker for blue and white anything so it wasn't that hard of a sell. as other reviewers have mentioned, the seams line up! this kind of quality is so hard to find in clothing items anymore and really makes the skirt seem much more pricey than it really is (if you're buying it on sale like i did). i'm 5'3" and will
other I saw this dress on the cashier at retailer and had to order it. it is, as one of the reviewers said, like having two dresses in one. the bottom dress is a full dress, and the top lays over it, not quite skimming but not quite loose either. i love the dress as i am a pear shaped, size 14, and this helps to camouflage some bumps nicely. this dress reminds of the dresses some peasant women wear in rural countries.
other Thought this would be great for a laid-back wedding in new mexico, but didn't fit. i am a 12-1other and the 1other barely fit my chest and arms. not flattering. material did not seem very breakthable. had to return. better luck next time.
other Color is beautiful, fits perfectly, lace is lovely and cut is feminine and flattering. hoping to top with a sweater so i can wear it longer in the season.
other I have not owned a denim jacket of this kind in...1other years? i have a wonderful pilcro chambray jacket with a military cut from last year, but this kind of boxy, straight up denim jacket cut has not been a part of my life for a while. however, i was in a store last weekend and with the additional 25% off, i thought it might be wise to give this a try. i'm so glad i did. i've now tried it over two fairly girly dresses, with tights and booties (it's not exactly spring in boston yet), and i love it.
other From the images, it looks like a basic black cardigan. look again because it's a beautiful fabric and can be dressed up or down. i'm 5"other and always wear an xsmall at retailer however i thought it to wear over other articles vogue clothing i'd size up. it fits perfect i did an xsmall petite and couldn't be happier
other I loved this dress. i kept putting it on trying to figure out how to get my boobs to not fall out all over the place. this is not a dress for larger breasts. it is absolutely beautiful otherwise!
other This dress is beautiful on so many levels. the colors and print are amazing and the maxi sweater dress idea is unique. it fits true to size and is very flattering. my only issue is the amount of shine that it has from the metallic threads running through it. i would have preferred less shine which would make the dress more versatile.
other This dress is a great dress for spring and summer (and early fall) events. it's surprisingly light weight and comfortable. you can pair different shoes with the dress due to the various colors which makes it easy to dress up and down. i definitely recommend if you're looking for a fun, floral, feminine dress.
other This top has the thickness and comfort of a sweatshirt, with artistic flair and a figure flattering, unique cut. it works very well on me as i'm a petite large. i only wish it was a little roomier, or that i was 10 lbs lighter, but it's stretchy and i really love wearing it. the color is a rich indigo with a slightly worn look which adds texture and dimension.
3 I bought this mostly to wear around the house, so i'll keep it because i got it on a pretty good sale.that said, this runs really large. the sleeves are really loose, and it doesn't really hang well over my hips, which is a shame. it's very soft and cozy, which is nice, but i don't think i'll leave the house in it often. it also arrived with a hole in the ribbing on the bottom of the front panel. i was able to tie a knot through one of the loops that i think will prevent further unraveling, bu
other Just not the right color for my skin tone (though lovely pink). i didn't see the green in person, but probably nice too.the cut is well fitted at the waist, elastic band. i will say, however, that it was almost hard to pull the shoulders over (doesn't unbutton past waist). fabric is soft and flowey, length on the regular was mid-though for me, i am a tad oder, so it was nice... if i were younger, i would get petite.for reference: 11other lbs, 30 dd, 26.other inch waist
other This is so ridiculously soft and conformable. it can be worn over workout clothes, or with skinnies or leggings. it looks fabulous either way. i wear mine the way the customer photo #other is shown: meaning, folded over. but it looks great either way. the green is such a nice neutral: it looks great with black or shades of brown, tan, or even grey. the functional pockets are such a nice touch.----------my only "criticism" is this is a dolman-style/drop hem sleeve, which i am not a huge fan of - bu
other These pants fit me perfectly..i am 5'7" and 13other (most days).. and wore a 4..they are so comfortable, i could sleep in them. they do stretch a little after wearing (linen), which can be a good thing to some...they are a heavier linen so good for mild winters..almost look denim..if they came in more colors i would get more!they also remind me of my old hippie days, which was fun
other I ordered these twice just to be sure there wasn't a glitch. the color is so off! the picture shows a dark blue denim, but they are not they are a light blue - with whiskering! retailer you need to have a better image of the color because this is so misleading.
other But runs large. i tried on the regular 0 in the store and it was very pretty but baggy. would definitely need a tank if i were to wear this to work. lace is romantic and i do like the button details. i would give it a try but for me i will take my chance and wait for sale if it makes it there in my sie. i need 00. petite already gone sadly. reference 11other lbs 30dd and 26.other on waist.
other This poncho is very pretty and unique.it does run very over-sized, however that's how it is styled to be. the embroidery is very nice, it does sit back on the should a little further than pictured. the open weave is a little looser than the picture seems and you will need to wear something under it (cami; tank; body shaper). probably will pick or snag pretty easily also. the longer hem in the back is cute, but if you are on the shorter side you may not like where it hits. it will look best with
other I purchased this poncho online in the cream color. when it arrived i tried it on to decide whether or not to keep it. i immediately went on line and purchased the taupe color , as well. thank goodness it didn't come in other more colors! this sweater is so versatile and beautifully detailed, plus it is very soft. you take one look at it and you know the quality! i think you could wear this dressed up or down and it would be perfect either way. i do agree, it is not quite as long as pictured , but pe
other Great fit, wonderfully made, and priced just right.
3 This is a pretty dress. i bought a size 0 and the body of the dress fit, however, the sleeves were too long. had to return, as the loose and longer sleeves made the dress look too big on me.
other I'm glad they put up some pix of non-models looking cute in this dress, as it's taken a beating in the reviews! i measure 34(a)-27-3other and have no problems with the size s fit at all. it's drapey but not voluminous, with no pulling at the hips. the "folded" detail up at the top does call attention to the shoulders, but not in a bad way. the pleated neckline is cute on a small chest, and the red pattern/palette is awesome. love the length too -- i am 5'4" & the size s hits me just above the knee.
other Cute top for jeans or capri pants. love the sleeve length.
other I'm on the fence about this dress but overall i like it. the material, design and all is great! it's a light seersucker type fabric and short sleeves are perfect for summer. now the bad thing about this dress is partly the print combined with the swing/large cut. if you aren't too careful it can look like a housedress or hospital gown. i find i definitely need a belt to define my waist to avoid this.
other Great style!
other I agree, this dress runs long, but since i love high heels, it falls just right for me. it does seem quite roomy for a medium, which is a pleasant surprise. the fabric, drape and quality are contemporary but i know i'll be wearing this beyond this year for sure.
other I ordered this shirt online and just received it in the mail. the floral design is nice, but the mesh fabric in the back is low quality and cheapens the look of the shirt (especially considering the price). most disappointingly, the neck hole is almost as small as the arm holes. with no zipper or button opening i could not fit my head through the opening and, thus, could not even put the shirt on. needless to say, i will be returning it. i ordered the xs, so it is possible that larger sizes do n
other This dress is so much more stunning in person than in the photos. it's incredibly flattering, and i like how it pans out at the bottom. it also has pockets! although it has a built-in slip, it is a little see-through, so keep that in mind, otherwise, i can't wear it enough.
other When i saw this blouse online i thought it looked like a great combination of casual with the elegance of an intricate print. i was so disappointed when it came. the print is not centered in the front or the back. it looks like they were trying to save on the material and just cut it out wherever with no thought to symmetry. for this price the detail of centering the design was expected, especially because this is how it appeared in the picture. loved the blouse, but i will be returning it becau
other I bought this top in hopes of getting a lot of wears out of it as we transition from summer to fall. the color is a pretty rust color perfect for fall, but also great for late summer. i love the leaf print, and the dark buttons on the sides really take the top to the next level. i love wearing this top with my high-waisted flare jeans, i get tons of compliments when i wear this top! it is definitely sheer, which i like, so i wish that it came with its own detachable camisole (the reason i took a
other I'm a short girl, but i usually wear tops in a small or medium at retailer. for me, i would have needed this shirt in a size at least one notch smaller than even offered. this shirt is adorable. love the details. i wanted it so bad, which is why i paid so much for a basic t-shirt. still, it was large to the point of frumpiness and could have used some sort of scoop or v-neck to break up the dots.
other Very nice sweater, surprisingly just as pictured color-wise, i ordered a large and it felt true to size in the shoulders, but this sweater flair out to the bottom, you can kind of see it in the photo, the length is good as well for a regular fit. it's very unique combination of fabric acrylic/wool knit, the texture is really nice and soft and looks very good on. also it's thick and warm. i wore the top to work today on 3other degree weather and received many compliments. sweater looks simple but the
other This top is gorgeous and versatile. i wear it with jeans and dress it up with a skirt. so happy to have this in my wardrobe.
other Looks great with skinny jeans, leggings, trouser/ wide leg. good length for a flattering look. longer in front on me than on model.... so soft. doesn't cling. not overwhelming because the sleeves are skinny and drape is narrow.
other Really love this jacket! i agree with the previous review that while the x small fits great when i am standing--it is a little hard to raise my arms in it. however- it is great to wear over a dress or with jeans at the office. great quality- lined with jersey. i've gotten many compliments! (5'8, 120 lbs, xsmall)
other These are worth the money! gorgeous fit, soft denim, and make my body look long and sleek (especially my bottom). i wear mine w a white tee underneath and plan to add booties for the fall but for now, platform clogs. fabulous.
3 I want to love this shirt but it isn't happening. the proportions shown on the model are not how this shirt ends up fitting. the fabric is super soft and the pattern is great, if the fit works for you.
3 This dress is beautiful in person, the details on it are amazing. the only problem i had was that it ran small. i am usually an 8 or 10 in retailer dresses, but had to size up to a 1other just to be able to breath. the top on the 10 was tight in the chest and arms. when i sized up to the 1other there was more room, but not by much. the embroidery detail on the dress is the best part, it is exactly as shown in the picture. plus it has pockets which is always a plus for me. lightweight and great for warm we
other I love this t-shirt! it's a little bit dressy because of the lace but the t-shirt material is great for casual wear. i tried on the white but ended up buying the black because the white is so sheer. i'll still have to wear a layering tank with it but the black just feels less sheer for some reason. really cute and nice quality t-shirt!
other I am a big fan of trench coats and i love that this one is navy. i typically gravitate toward blues because it brings out my eyes and my wardrobe tends to fall in a blue-ish category. i love that the color of this coat will compliment other pieces of clothing in my closet wonderfully.i especially love the design of the trench with the wider, pleated bottom which allows for fluffier dresses but also creates an illusion that is slimming for anyone's figure. this is a fantastic, unique design for
other I ordered this item before seeing the july 25th review. i ordered in a s and need an xs. now the xs is sold out unfortunately. my waist measures 27", hips 32", and i am 5'4". the material very nice, has elastic for movement and comfort. i would wear this all the time if i had the correct size. it would be cute dressed down or up.
other Perfect lace tank. i am six feet tall and this top hits me about where it does on the model. i ordered xl and feel it is a generous tts . it is very figure flattering and not too tight across the bust. it has a thin lining so no camisole is needed. so beautiful!
other I have 7 pair of pilcro denim shorts from retailer and for some reason the colored ones (white, yellow, pink) hold their shape but the denim blue completely stretch out. i went down a size in these and they still stretch to the point of sagging. i really want the black ones...hoping they don't do it too.
other Love this dress! ordered a 0p and it fit perfectly.
other I purchased this top at my local store this past weekend, and i have to say i already know it will become an easy, go-to top. it does run large, so consider that when choosing what size to order. i generally wear a medium, but purchased a small in this top.
other This dress is so gorgeous! it fits perfectly, is stretchy, wonderful, comfortable, and the fabric is nice and thick with beautiful texture. i absolutely love it! i'm 5'6", 12other lbs, with a pretty athletic build, and it fits like a dream! i love the color, the fabric, the fit, the stretch, the comfort, the sexyness of it..... it's my new favorite! highly recommended!
other This elegant white lace dress attracted compliments everywhere i wore it. it is classic with just the right amount of quirkiness . i like everything about it!
other I am so happy i ordered this jumpsuit. it is exactly as pictured and has a very flattering fit. the fabric is light and it's very well made. great length for dressing up with heals or dressing down with flats. i love it!
other These are so comfortable and surprisingly flattering! i bought the taupe in sp, for reference i'm 5'2', 11other lbs., curvy on bottom. i was afraid it would give me a "bubble butt" and it didn't. could be dressed up with right shoes/accessories.
other This is definitely true to size. i tried both the small and medium on in the store and the small was too tight( this is meant to be a little looser like a tshirt) the medium was spot on. not too tight and not too baggy. i think it's a fun go to piece that can be worn with a jean jacket and sandels or booties. it looks like denim too which i wasn't expecting. way better in person!
3 I love these shorts, very pretty and well made, but if you have any kind of muscle in your thighs, beware, not as flattering as on the model a9dn probably previous reviewer). shorts hit at hte widest part of my leg, creating a weird tent effect around the area. waist was true to sizw and i can only imagine how beautiful they would be on "skinny" legs.
3 These pants are adorable as pajamas or maybe something very casual to wear to the beach, but they honestly do not seem like something that a grown woman would wear in public. they are good quality and fit nicely, but i feel like if you're over 20, they're not really flattering or especially appropriate.
other I was able to try this on in store thanks to a return. it is a cool looking item and i thought the fit and aesthetic were spot on but the price made me leave it behind. even on sale, i this wasn't worth the price for me- the high-low hem and material combined exclude it as a work option for me. if this is something you can get mileage out of, i really do recommend it- well made, lovely colors, and nice style.
other When i first saw this top online, i thought it is very common beach like cover up, give or take. the main point of attraction for me was the cobalt blue silk trim. very vibrant looking color and very attractive. cough my eye for sure. however, when it arrived i was really surprised, how the top turned out to be. 1. much larger than expected, very roomy. 2. cobalt blue turned out to be not so bright, in fact, not even that interesting as it stands out in the photo. not too bad, but unexpected, i
other Great color and fabric! a bit on the sheer side but not completely see-through. perfect for spring, summer and even into fall. wore it on a weekend trip to the beach with capris and then to work with a cropped blazer. planning on ordering it in additional colors if it's still available. a good staple for your wardrobe!
other Tried this soft yummy jumpsuit on and loved the flow and softness of the fabric ...... will be able to wear into the fall with oversized sweater or wrap. just love
other When this dressed first debuted, i pretty much ignored it because i was not looking for a sleeveless maxi dress for fall. then i went on instagram and saw all the marvelous ways retailer employees were styling this. this can be worn as a long vest over jeans or a long sleeve maxi. and the rich autumn colors go well with boots and sweaters. add a wide leather belt when it's opened or closed, works great either way. when i bought my dara vegan leather moto in plum, i knew this would be an ideal pair
other This jacket feels like a throw blanket, but has shape and is appropriate to wear both casually or dressed up to make it profession enough to wear to the office. the jacket is bias cut and longer in the back to cover your rear. since it's fleece, the sleeves roll up easily and you can move around in it with ease. it has pockets big enough to carry your phone. i'm 5'7" 13other with a small chest and i got the jacket in my normal size small and it's loose enough for me to wear layers underneath. if i w
other This dress has great details and fit well on my hourglass shape. it just felt too covered up at the arms/shoulders, though. if the sleeves had been shorter or it had been sleeveless i think it would have felt a little more modern. the waistband on the one i tried on was also twisted, so you might want to check that before you buy. fit is tts. a little on the short side.
other I ordered this top despite the other reviews and i'm very glad i did. it is adorable. well made and very flattering. i am usually a size xs or 00 but based on the reviews sized up to a 0. fits perfectly. not snug at all. highly recommend!
other This is a bit pricey, but it's the most beautiful sweater that i own. it fits beautifully, and the material is soft, not itchy, which is important for a sweater with a cowl neck. the cowl sits beautifully, no matter how you "fold" it. and, the pattern both at the neck and the bottom is vibrant and bright, and is just lovely. i ordered a small and it covers my butt, which is perfect for leggings, or even with tights and boots. it's not shapeless, but seems to graze your thighs, and has a mild tur
other I do recommend this dress with some caveats. 1: it'll be difficult to find a bra that won't show straps, and 2: it's very figure flattering so if you're body conscious, particularly tummy
other Really cute everyday dress. love the fabric and material, it's super soft. a great dress to just throw on and go.
other Clothes generally tend to look great when you're svelte. hence thin models. i've recently put on a few pounds (normally a 4-6, xs, small in retailer, 5'6" and i have boobs) and when i get lazy and eat a little too much i get it around the middle. i already have a chest so that makes finding clothes to look flattering harder bc the boobs create the apple effect. all that said just to make the point that this is a flattering sweater. i grabbed it last minute on the way to the dressing room, but i ne
other This button down is to die for! the material is incredibly soft and comfy. it looks great with my retailer leggings, and is also a great look with my casual denim, paired with a cardi and flats or booties. i've worn it several times for different looks and always get compliments on it! definitely a head-turning piece.
3 First, i absolutely love cloth & stone. but lately i'm finding some of the styles are going in a direction that just doesn't fit my style. that's ok because they still have some good basics. what i mean is the cut. a lot of their pieces are super long in the back and super short in the front (ie their slip dress they have out right now). this particular tank is like that, although this one is borderline. the sides cut up a little too high for my tastes and i can't help but think i'm wearin
other Like other reviewers i was hesitant to spend this much on a pair of jeans. however, i purchased them at  20% off on retailer day and...honestly...they look so good i probably would have paid full price. these jeans are fresh!
other These are some of my favorite new pants. i am never disappointed by the quality from this brand and they are super comfortable and adorable. a definite must have!
other This dress is lovely- exactly as pictured on the site. love the colors/pattern and received so many compliments when i wore it to a brunch party. could easily be dressed up for an outdoor wedding. it definitely runs big- i am usually an 8/10 and originally ordered in a large. was way too big, so had to exchange for a m and there was still some room. make sure you size down!
other This dress either runs large or just has too much fabric. ordered my usual size, but it is too long and too baggy to do a thing for me. embroidery pretty, but background is more of a muddy gray, then denim as shown. if the smaller size in petite was available, i'd have exchanged it, but it is going back.
3 Love the shape and cut of this top but it is so sheer you could see my belly button through it. if it was a dark color i would buy it. wore my regular size small. i'm 5'5"130lbs  and 32dd.
3 The blouse was not flattering on me. it would be for someone with a straight slim body type, it falls mid hips and so it accentuates my hips making them look larger. it's flared so it cannot really be tucked in.
other I just received this dress yesterday, so to be fair, i have not worn it out in public yet. i am deciding whether or not to keep it. i typically love west coast dolan dresses and this one is no different in looks. it's adorable and would be a great addition to your fall wardrobe. my only concern is the back. the back looks like a wrap dress that's backward - just the bottom half (that probably makes no sense). my worry is that the slightest bit of wind could catch it and the whole thing could ope
3 I like the quality of material of this top but it's too long and wide for my frame. the high neck feels odd for my broad shoulders. too bad as i really wanted to love this.
other Beautiful dress and so delicately well made!5'1" 95lb - xxs petite or the smallest size possible worked for meit accentuates one's curvy body and covers up any excess skin in the belly area. i could eat on freely at a formal occasion. words just cannot describe how beautiful this dress is.
3 This is a beautiful lined jacket, with a much more structured fit than a typical kimono. it hit me at the high hip, not low hip as shown on the model. given how structured it is, i don't think the "one size" will work for anyone larger than a small if you want a drapey kimono fit.
other I bought this a little ago in the denim color. it has become a favorite so much that i bought another in white.
other I love birds
other Material was a tad rough for my liking. the color did nothing for my olive complexion. given the price of this shirt (even with 20% off) i don't think it's worth it. if i'm spending $100+ on a blouse i need to love it and i do not love this one...going back.
other I followed the advice of the other reviewer and went other sizes up, i'm so glad that i did. i'm usually an 8 and i ordered a 1other and they are just right. the pleats made them very flowy in the hip, so it gives a little wider look on me than i really want, but i really love these shorts, so it's not a deal breaker. overall, i am happy with them, but definitely size up!
other I never ever buy anything full price when it comes to retailer shopping, love their stuff but way over priced so i patiently watch and wait. this dress though i couldn't do it, i had to have it. i think it is a fabulous addition to my summer collection and i look forward to wearing it in a few weeks to a july 4th get away. get it while you can.
other Purchased on sale and worth the $20 or so dollars. just a good basic top. scoop neck not too deep, fabric is opaque enough to not need a cami.
other I love this sweater especially the color. i never would have order this sweater on line but when i saw it in person the color was more of a burnt orange. the fit was perfect. i can wear with skinny jeans or leggings.
other I have always liked this look so ordered my usual size s. fit is good & looks pretty much on me as in the pic - even the arm length works - not too long. i don't care for the placement of the top buttons which are just cosmetic. they dangle downwards showing more of the loop than the button itself. placement is not directly over the bottom buttons, which puts it in the lower breast area. mmmmm... not the look i want. looks unattractive. if i keep this, i will have to move the buttons more in lin
other This is a fairly high quality tank which i purchased in blue-green. it's narrower at the top, more voluminous at the bottom and a heavier knit than i expected, so i'm a little concerned about stretching over time, but i'll be careful washing it and enjoy it till that day does (or doesn't) come.
other This is a such a cute top. can be dressed up for work or worn more casually. very flattering. i'm 5'6" and 125lb. i was borderline between the xs and s but ended up with the s because it was a tad longer and more 'tunic-y.' bought two colors!
other The quality of this top is wonderful. thick enough to prevent see-through, but thin enough to create a beautiful drape. the fringe details are lovely. the top is slightly roomy (ranks between "true to size" and "runs large," i.e., leaves room in the back when i clasp my hands together and stretch them out in front of me), but not really enough to size up. i'm 5'-4", 120 lbs., athletic build, and the small fits well. my only issue with the aesthetic is that the pattern of the lace on the upper pa
other I love these pants. saw them in-store & couldn't do it at full price but they're a steal on sale. super soft & comfy. love the wide leg. fits true to size. i'm 5'2" 12other lbs & ordered the xs bc no petite. waistband fits a bit tight but i prefer that to them slipping down. would buy again,
3 Very pretty, romantic
other I'm happy the other reviewers made this dress work because it looked terrible on me. i'm 5,9" and 128 lbs and it made me look like i had gained 2other lbs. as others have said, the pockets make the dress even worse-it's very hard to get them to lay flat. the material is lovely, soft and i liked the gray color, but this dress made me feel like i was wearing something from an asylum.
other Love this top, it's a 100% cotton and looks amazing with jeans. you should consider ordering a size up, i am usually an 0, 32d and 107pound. tried the 0 in store it just didn't feel right the size other fit just right.love the shirt, and got tons of complement:)
other These are fab as always with pure good printed leggings. bright, beautiful print, great quality fabric, and flattering. goes with lots of color tops too! took my usual size s (4/27 in bottoms) and found them perfect.
other I purchased this top in an antro store last week. the quality is wonderful and the greenish blue color is very unique. the blouse has a beautiful stretchy camsiole that is attached at the shoulders, but can be removed by snaps. i tooks great when worn two different ways. i wore it with the campole out, and it peeks through the blouse at the bottom. it also looks great when the camisole is worn in. my only wish is that it would come in a petite size as it's a touch big at the shoulders and neckli
other But if that works for you it is a cute pattern. this is a lighter weight sweater but good for fall.
other This shirt is a very cute dressed up casual kind of top. the lace detail in the front and the back make a plain, long sleeve black top look elegant. the material on the shirt is pretty light, so it is for fall or spring.
other This dress is adorable. it's easy to wear, really comfortable and i think looks great on. i'm 5'4", i probably should have gotten a petite - the shortest part of the dress meets my knees. the fabric is quite soft, flows like jersey - it does seem to be a little cheaper and i can't speak to durability yet...hoping it holds up!
other Loved the look of this sweater online. was disappointed when i took it out of the package i was surprised at how stiff and itchy it was. i ordered my usual medium and though at first they shipped the wrong size it was small all over.  it felt cheep definelty not worth the high price. knew it was definitely going back
other I was very impressed upon receiving this dress. i'm 5'3, 102lbs and ordered xs. fit perfect. i am also a 32dd, so if you are smaller than a d or big c, the top portion might be a little big for you. love how it is lined so you could technically wear without a bra. i bought the tangerine and have gotten many complements.
other I own a couple of pairs of natori hipsters and recently purchased the yellow to go with the front close natori bra. i tried to wear thong panties but they just didn't work for me. thankfully, natori makes these lovely panties that still make me feel sexy and they are way more comfortable. they also receive rave reviews from my husband. : )
other This has great drape, length, the pattern is super versatile with solids or prints. i am finding the wool to be itchy around the neck, so not sure if i will keep, though i don't seem to want to take it off! has a lightweight, boiled wool texture, contrasting print and design so cool!
3 These are my first paige cords/pants and they seem to run much smaller than the other brands i wear. i'm normally a 3other in all other brands but with these the waist is pretty tight. i do love the length (i'm 5'9 and they are plenty long.) i also love the bell/flare. i'm not sure what makes this brand so much more expensive as the quality though nice seems comparable to cheaper brands.
other This skirt is perfection. i am 5'8 130ibs and the other fit perfect. the picture does not even do it justice. it is much more softer than i thought it would be. in the picture it seems stiff looking but that is not the case at all. can't wait to wear this skirt for the summer. you can dress it up with a nice blouse and heels or keep it casual with a relaxed tee and sandals. i will defiantly get a lot of use out of this piece!
3 This fabric of this top is gorgeous. however, i'm 5' 5" and it hits in a really weird spot. right no the point of the hip that you don't want to accentuate. you could wear it with leggings to a casual thing, but i work in an office so its too short to wear with leggings and too long to wear with jeans. sad, i love the top 90% of it.
other I generally like this style of pants- and these are particularly interesting, flattering and perfect for the season. love them.the style can be bohemian and chic or more conservative. the color is also a dark navy, and there is black leather piping on the 'pockets' making them a neutral- navy or black. i've worn with a long sleeveless hi-low hemmed button down top and neutral (saddle) heels for work with a cream jacket- and with a t'shirt and flats for the weekend. they have a bit of str
other Love the texture and color of this tunic. it does seem to run large - i could have probably sized down to a pl without an issue. i do agree with other reviewers that the pockets are strangely placed and add bulk. i'm going to have them removed. overall, i really like it and have already worn it multiple times.
other The pictures don't do this justice. it's so beautiful on. drapes incredibly. the cream color is a warm, creamy bright off white. looks really nice. incredibly comfortable. i could see this being an excellent item to wear on planes. super cozy and chic. a must have.
other I'm not sure if the top i received was damaged or if the design didn't consider gravity but this is not what i expected. i really want to like this top, but i don't see how i can wear it.
other This dress is huge. also, i was super disappointed in the fabric. i thought it would be silly like a georgette. but it was coarse, more like a poplin, and thin. i thought it looked cheap.
other I rarely order pants on line...as the size often varies so much. took a chance on these as they were on sale and they are just stink'n adorable! i am so glad i did, i love them. i ordered both colors, haven't got the neutral pair yet but the green plaid fits me like they were made for me!! for reference i am about 5"3' tall, my weight is around 137.other ish. i ordered the 28 regular, and they fit perfectly. i hope they don't stretch to much when i wear them. if so i will update my review.i just lo
other This dress is super cute and sexy. i bought the taupe in a size medium. for reference i'm tall (5'11) and weigh about 152. i don't know how tall the last reviewer is but this was not too short in the front for me. i really like it.
other This is the most flattering shirt--love the fit and color!
other Bought this dress for engagement photos and was a little worried about sizing, but when i got it it fit perfectly and was very comfortable. it runs true to size. my only complaint is that there was a missing button on the sleeve, but because there was an extra it was easily fixed. definitely recommend!
other Great tee for layering, love the sweet lace along the bottom. the lace lines the entire body of the tee and it's a little thin so i prefer a cami underneath but a nude bra would be invisible. i usually wear a small, sometimes an xs, and the small fits like it does on the model.
other 3 tags sewn in, other small (about 1'' long) and other huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however, this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!
other Have kept my eyes out for a jacket like this for several years now. and this one is more than i had hoped for.  in the store i was between a l and m.  so went with the large.  after getting home and trying on a couple more times i decided to order the petite large.  jacket is roomy warm and so so soft.  added bonus w the hood.
other Absolutely stunning top! love! what a great buy on sale! i wear a medium/large and purchased the size 12...fits perfect! beware that the bottom has somewhat of a flair! the material is light so i would say this top is something to be worn transitioning between seasons, late summer to fall!
other Bought this dress based on the other reviews and was glad i did. fabric is very nice and soft. it drapes nicely, hiding my tummy trouble area. very flattering and not too short, i could wear it with a blazer to work and also out on a date night. happy with my purchase.
other This is my second pair of joggers from retailer and since this purchase, i have bought another pair. it seems that they are just a great fit for my body, long and lean, but not extreme. someone said they run large, but my experience is true to size. these pants can be very casual around the house, out for errands or dressed up and worn for casual evenings out. i love that the elastic waist isn't bunchee. they hang very straight and pretty, just like in this picture. the fabric has some text
other This dress truly is a work of art and i am becoming a little obsessed with byron lars' clothing line. this is my 3rd dress by him and i have been a size other in the other dresses. the other does fit in this dress but it is a little snug. not sure if a other would look as good because it is meant to be form fitting. the panels trick the eye into making you look thinner too. my dimensions 32c,26,33. it fits perfectly in the hips and waist but is tight on top.
other I ordered this skirt in both colors and they are just to die for. the fun fabrics make it a playful and trendy take on a timeless essential, and the fit is incredibly flattering. an added bonus: the fabric has give so it's also extremely comfortable. i hope they come out with more color options!
other A bit wide in the torso, but the detail at the bottom of shirt makes up for it.
other I love the colorblock color combo. the colors are neutral enough to go with so many things yet still be unique and stand out. the fit was perfect. i took my normal size medium.
other Bought this in an xs and i liked the style of the skirt. it was long enough to wear to work. however the waist was too large and would not stay up on my waist. returned.
other I just love this dress! it is so pretty and feminine and comfortable. the colors and patterns are perfect for both spring and fall and i know that this is one piece that i will get a lot of use out of. originally, i thought the cut would be a bit boxy but it is not at all. in fact, the fabric is beautiful, soft, and flowy with a lovely bohemian aesthetic. it looks great with tights, tall boots and a big floppy wool hat. any one considering this dress should defiantly try it on, as it is highly u
other I ordered this online in a m and l because i am usually one of those on the bottom - i will be returning both for a s. the fabric is great and a cool pattern, but it runs large by far. in addition to the large sizing the fabric has a decent stretch so that makes it even larger. i think the small will fit well and the cut is flattering - i am about 5'11'' and it hits below my knees, similar to the model in the picture, so i would definitely get this in petite if youre on the shorter side. it's al
other This dress is beautiful and would make an excellent party dress for winter. it is well made and the details are pretty. however the waist is cut in sort of a scallop shape, so it is higher on the sizes and dips down in the middle over the stomach. i wear a size l or 10 in dresses at retailer, and it just did not flatter my body type at all. for a thinner, narrow silhouette, i suppose it would look better, like it does on the model. i had to return it.
other Very pretty color (slightly darker than on my computer), a bit like a light periwinkle/lavender... embroidery is lovely and the dress has a fresh spring-like quality. the style is a basic shift, but the color and details make up for the straight shape. great dress for the spring/summer months. good quality and was a nice deal on sale!
other These leggings are very comfortable and cute. only reason they are not other stars is because the pattern is not quite as vibrant as i was expecting.
other I received this tee in grey as gift and immediately went online to buy another!beware because the color names are confusing. i originally thought it was a mix up in the naming on the website so i ordered the "red", thinking i'd get the red colored tee. however, the "red" tee is actually a light orange color. the "orange" tee is actually a burgundy/red color.i ended up keeping the orange colored tee although i actually wanted the red color, because i really do love the quality of this shirt!
other Can't say enough about these pants.i often find leggings to be to revealing when wearing them with long but not long enough top. i have a longer torso so finding tops that hit this sweet spot is an issue for me. i also don't love long flowy tops with jeans all the time. the portions look all off and i look and feel heavy in my middle section.cue these darlings! with out any buttons, zippers on the front your shirts will lay flat and crisp. i feel comfortable and appropriate at my causal work o
other Usually the whole boho style looks funny on me, but the cut and print were subtle enough for me to pull it off. the colors are beautiful - probably flattering against any hair or skin tones...i took my usual small because the shoulders were generous enough. word of caution - this is dry clean only.
other The pants were true to size in the waist but they were a touch long for my 5'5" 120 lbs frame (i got a size 0). they did stretch out a little during the day (i wore them about 10 hours), but not nearly as much as the other reviews led me to believe. however, they were a little loose on my legs when i first put them on, which i liked.
3 I didn't have any problems with the fit, i love the puffin pattern, the material is nice---it's just so short. i really haven't decided if the print is worth the awkwardness of the length, or if i'll just keep it and only wear it when it's cool enough outside to wear a tank under it, so i can avoid flashing my stomach every time i lift my arms. but, yeah...it stops right at my waist in front. way too short--stop making these great shirts so short, please.
other I like how styling and comfortable it is, i bought it in both colors. definitely a nice piece for fall/winter in this houston weather.
other Love this dress. had to exchange it because it runs a little small. i got the right size and it is beautiful.
3 This shirt is adorable, love the lace detail on the sides, but way too boxy for me. it's a great lighter weight for spring, but it doesn't feel flimsy. sadly, there isn't any shape to help make this flattering. it will be returned.
other This "little" dress is extremely cute and very comfortable. i didn't pay enough attention to the picture and totally missed the faux wrap skirt, but that only adds to the appeal, and is well done, not showing too much skin. this dress looks great with a white denim jacket or a red cardi. it will get lots of use and really is a 3 quarters of the year piece.
other I was pleasantly surprised by this beautiful sweater! being that it's a wool blend, i thought it would be itchy against my skin. to my surprise, it is quite the opposite. very cozy and soft, with plenty of "wiggle room". i'm very tall and having enough length for my arms is always a concern. the sleeves are long and comfortable. this sweater is quickly becoming one of my new favorite "go to" pieces!
other This shirt is more stunning in person. the color is a brighter turquoise than shown & the details are beautiful. fits true to size & is very flattering/slimming. love it!
other I was immediately drawn to the ochre yellow color of this dress and it's stitch and pleat details and was happy to score it early enough in the season still in my size and preferred color option. unlike other reviewers, i was not turned off by the ribbing at the neck and arm lines. i received the dress yesterday, am wearing it today, and have already received compliments from even the most sour-faced co-workers who can't give a compliment or share casual conversation in the hallway. the sunny ye
other This is made of soft, sweatshirt material. it is one of those dresses that you can put on with sandals or birkinstocks and go out to breakfast or throw it on to go to the beach or wear after yoga. this is not a "dressy" dress. that said, i love it. i used to have a sweatshirt dress from another brand that i wore out and have been searching for the replacement. this color is a pale celadon, a tad bit more vibrant than the photo, which makes it more flattering than you may think. i wear a 4-6 and
other I have the blue version. i love the bold, pop art pattern. the colors are strong but neutral enough to pair with a myriad of different options for the top.
other I got this top in the black and i love it. the bottom is a silky material that's really beautiful, and the cutout details are really pretty. so many of retailer's sweaters are enormous, but this one fits tts. my one complaint is that the bottom white part wrinkles really easily.
other This top is super cute and comfy! just wish they would have made more xl's - ran out fast! i am 5'10 and usually wear an 8-10 top in retailer, so i purchased a large in this top to get the length and look of the model in the picture. it was too short and didn't fall like the picture, i tried to exchange for the xl and it was already sold out! bummer! was looking forward to wearing this all summer! other stars for running out of a size so quickly! please make more!!
other I was stoked to get this dress, and it is truly beautiful, but the fit is so awful. it was like being swallowed up by a bag. i ordered my usual size 6; i'm 5'7" 140 lbs, and a bra size 34dd, but the dress just fell on me like a sack. i was so disappointed!! had to return.
other This dress is gorgeous in person, soft and wonderfully comfortable with two large pockets. it also comes with a cotton knit slip for added swing. i bought at size 6 which was two sizes smaller than my normal size 10 in retailer dresses. i have worn twice and each time other random strangers have complimented it. it dry cleaned beautifully and it is really fun to wear. the model is shows the neck wide open but it is very cute tied in a little bow. expensive maybe, but well worth it.
other This dress is adorable! i purchased it in black and white to wear to my daughter' s bridal shower. i received so many compliments. it was comfortable, stylish and best of all wrinkle free. i actually ordered it online and when i got it, the dress required no ironing of any kind. love it! i think i may have to get in in the red also.
other Beautiful detail. fits likes a glove. i have a short torso and design hits perfectly on my waist. may not be good for those with longer torsos. very flattering . arm holes well fitted. no open gaps. i plan to wear this to a november wedding.
other I got this dress in neutral motif. looks very cute and the size is perfect.
other I love this dress for fall. it is slightly sheer, so i would recommend wearing tights or a slip underneath, but it is lightweight enough for fall that i can transition the dress into the season as it gets colder. one note -- i am 5'1", and was required to size down to an xs in this dress due to length. the xs is perfect for work, as it hits me slightly above my knees.
other I saw someone else wearing this sweater and had to find it! i'm 5'5"and 118 lbs and ordered the small. the back of the sweater hits a few inches above my back pockets. i've been wearing it with a tank underneath and it's been the perfect sweater for fall weather. i was worried the poncho effect might make it hard to wear this sweater with a jacket but it's actually less bulky than other "real" sweaters i have.
other I agree with another reviewer. the neckline is just right, not too low cut and a normal bra should work fine. also it would be nice if this dress were lined. the top part has more than one layer so that's not an issue, but the skirt doesn't so i'll likely wear spanks. other than that, it's a great maxi and perfect for spring or summer (light weight)..
other I don't know what it is about this top but i was so drawn to it when i saw it in the store. it's totally see through, that's the design and i think it's great. i wear a cami underneath but if you're more daring or you spend a lot of time by the beach, you can get away with a nude bra or bikini top. this definitely runs small. i'm 5'5" 120 and usually wear xs/s but felt most comfortable in a medium. the body isn't tight or anything, it's just on the shorter side, especially if you have a longer t
3 This is the prettiest little sweater with such nice details. but it will not work well on a person like me with a full bust (38d) even in a larger size than i normally wear. it is also very, very short in the body. i would recommend it for a petite person with a small bust though.
other Well-made, gorgeous bra! the 'red' is more wine in person, which is great. this bra runs quite small--go up at least other band and other cup size. i got a 36c and it fits great! (i'm a 34b across brands like vs, etc.) you'll feel extra saucy and a bit mischievous knowing you're wearing something this sexy.
3 I really liked the style of this top but it's way oversized! i'm petite and drowned in this top even though i got it in an xs. the material is nice but i can't see i had a feeling for the cut because it runs so big. this one is going back to the store!
other Beautiful dress, can be dressed up or down. runs just a bit large, but if i had sized down it would have been too tight in the bust (38d). i normally wear a medium and the medium was perfect in the chest. the color is absolutely gorgeous and i love the length - i don't like dresses that show my knees. my only complaint is that a dress that is this expensive even on sale should have better quality control. mine made it to me without a button at the the back. not a huge deal, but it won't be easy
other These are super comfy and a great fitting everyday short. the embroidery gives them a nice touch. i am ordering another pair!
other I have worn this with skinny jeans and espadrilles untucked and with black linen shorts. i also wore tucked in with high waisted slim fit black pants,i got compliments on all the looks. i think it's a fun and cheerful, feminine summer top.i got mine on sale so i thought was a fair price for what it is. wouldn't have paid full retail.requires ironing.i am a size other and 5'3 and have a small.
other It runs long for a 5'1" woman like me:) other than that beautiful dress for vacation
other This wide leg pant gives the perception of a skirt that is feminine, comfortable, and moves beautifully when you walk. can be used all year round!
3 I was so excited to see this yellow dress online but was disappointed with the color when it arrived. the yellow us much darker than pictured. i felt the dress ran true to size but if you're short you definitely want to go with petite sizes.
other I was so curious to see this skirt. it looks just like pic. really gorgeous bold pattern and a faux suede like fabric. my only problem was that i thought there was too much fabric. i love maxi skirts. i am 5&#39;8&quot; and 136 lbs. it was a bit long on me but just had too much fabric. i have slim hips but this made them look larger. skirt is almost ballroom gown like in its fullness. loved it and someone else might love it but for me, it was too much. wish it worked!
3 Nice dress, you can wash it, i got black in med. i am 8-10 in tops and it is perfect, brand new is beautiful not sure how it will look after wash. great design. i wish it would be lighter material. material is very thick and heavy for a short sleeve dress. probably will stretch when you sit in car driving. i will be returning it for that reason, too heavy for summer .
other This shirt had an overpowering vinegar odor when i took it out of the packaging.the mint green color was appealing but the styling did not look good and the smell was too much.
other Had to return. ordered an xs which usually fits perfect. 34b chest and it was falling off. shoulders and chest!! it was like a sleeping bag. huge fan of retailer but there is a design flaw in this sweater.
other I ordered both colors in xxs (xs p and xxs p were both sold out at the time sale came on): verdict, fits really nicely, but short. i would have to wear this with higher rise pants or pencil skirt (like the red one is pictures with a polka dot skirt). i decided to keep the red one, because it is a bot more unique, i do have a few navy tops. the xxs fits "fitted" (can't think of another way of saying it), so i like it as it will go nicely with looser bottoms. i love the sleeves, the ruffles make t
other Bought this dress to wear for my engagement brunch! it does run big, but it's a laid back dress to wear?i never had to adjust the dress of myself while wearing it.
other Soft and cozy, not itchy at all, and it has pockets! i am 5'3, 120lbs, 34dd bra and take this in size small.
3 I was so excited to receive this romper. it's a great material, but it's actually a bit drab. the colors are very bland and the flowers just hang. it's not flattering as it is very roomy.
other I love wearing this so much! i wear it with leggings, jeans and i also like to pair it with is a long linen skirt that i have. i purchased it in plum and then went back for a second in moss. i got them before they went on sale for fear they'd be out of my size. i am very happy with my purchase! i highly recommend.
other Love this top, purchased it in the coral color now i'm definitely wanting it in the blue since it is such a great blouse for transitioning into fall. the weight of the top it good since i live in south texas so definitely needing lightweight long sleeves for our weather. i'm sure when the time comes adding a long cardigan or blazer over it as needed for the cooler weather it will look great. fit true to size.
other I bought these for next year. ordered both 27 & 28 and kept the 27, which i would say is a pretty true 6.
other I'm 5'5" and 140 lbs - hardly super-tiny and the xs was swimming on me. the shoulders are oddly large and this beautiful sweater/jacket just hangs off the body. believe it when they say "oversized styling" - unfortunately will have to return.
other I was looking for a dress for an upcoming interview. this fit the bill. when i took it out of the packaging i was worried it would be boxy, but it hit in all the right places. it was loose enough allowing for movement, but accentuated my waist. it hangs to just above my knee in an xl (i typically wear a 14-16). i was very impressed with the material. it feels very soft and luxurious.
other I love this skirt. it does run a little small, i ordered an extra small and it is tight at the waist, but still works. i have received more compliments on this skirt than maybe anything i have owned. i've been stopped at the grocery store by people telling me how much they like it. i also work with kids, and they all love it as well.
other Very nicely made with attention to detail. thick and comfy. hand washing recommended. that's the only negative.
other This is a very nice jumpsuit; reviewers were correct stating that torso is long & fit better a taller person. as soon as i read the reviews i went on and placed an order for size 8, i'm 6ft tall 160lb and it has been very difficult to find a jumpsuit to fit my long torso. this one however turned out to be perfect! true to size and fit, not only that, the fabric is very soft and good quality, very interesting style of the jumpsuit, looks much better in person! i particularly liked cropped, wide-l
other I want this in every color! fits tts...so comfortable, flattering, and fabric feels like it will hold up well (fingers crossed). love love love.
other Love this dress! very soft and easy to wear. i'm 5'4" and it hits the top of my knees which is perfect for me. can't wait to wear it with white leggings and boots this winter. i've seen several similar styles and tried on a few at other boutiques but they were thick material and bulky denim. this is the perfect, light and soft to the touch. highly recommend!
other Since several reviews said that this dress ran small online, i decided to go to my local retailer store to try this on in person. i am 5"6", 120 lbs. and normally a 0 or 2. the other worked perfectly. i loved the red version online but thought the green was better for me in person (the red is a tomato red and was more overpowering on my fair skin). the green also has light blue in the detail print so maybe good if you have blue eyes. no problems with the zippers on the ones i tried at the store.
other I ordered the "london, paris, milan" print red top in a size 4. i go back and forth with ordering 2's and 4's but i figured that with long sleeves, i'd rather have a little room than it be fitted. my boyfriend asked if i bought it for valentine's day- the red print and the cities struck him as romantic. anyway, lovely top. lightweight material will be nice for layering during winter, and wearing on it's own in spring and next fall.
other Poor quality, material looks much thinner and cheaper than pictured.
other I just love this blouse! it fits well and is really feminine and pretty. i paired it with a skirt and received lots of compliments!
other Bought this sweater as soon as i saw it. the knit ribs and the length help slim your lines. it is flattering even on my heavier mid section. the material is airy but not see through (yay!) i love that the deep v-neck with collar is not too deep for the office. i would buy another if another color becomes available. perfect spring to summer sweater
other The fit and design are interesting. in the 00p, the fit was good though the dress was not easy to get into or out of - strategy required. the quality is fine. but the color was very "blah," with too little of the bright stripes in an otherwise rather dull color scheme. that made the dress overall feel too busy and rather confused. with the lining and material weight, it would be more a cold weather item only, not an all seasonal dress.generally, it was interesting but not a "most come home wit
other I love this top and wear it all the time. it's a gorgeous pale blue and feels amazing....it is a tighter fitting shirt so if you like looser clothes, size up
other This dress looks nothing like the photo. the sequins are dull, no sheen at all. the faux leather panels and straps look and feel like cheap, shiny plastic. i didn't even try it on, because it was so hideous, when i pulled it out of the box. not remotely worth the price and wouldn't buy it on sale for $20 either. skip.
other I first got the coral one and was so in love with it that i ended up getting the other colors. it's just so cute, flattering, so cute with a long necklace and i just love how the back dips down and covers your butt. i've been heavily contemplating getting a second coral one i'm so worried if something happens to it lol i'm weird like that. it's always the good stuff that can't be replaced
3 Fyi to help with sizing i am 5'7" weigh 13other lb and like things loose fitting but the medium was too big and sack like. dress is cute and the color is true to photo.
other I love the dress enough to go on a diet. i sized up but still have reservations about the integrity of the seams if i should sit at any point during its wear. i hate skin tight clothing, and wear a 0 in everything else - the other made me feel as if you could see my cervix. i own other byron lars dresses that fit in a 0 - something happened with this dress.
other Cute and comfy. looks like i will be able to dress up a bit too. fabric and fit are great!
other So after reading the other reviews, decided to just order my usual size (26), thinking they might be a tad snug. wrong! they were huge! i looked at the size to see if they sent me a size 30 by mistake! unfortunately small sizes sold out. quality is excellent as well as style, so bummed!
other I purchased the turquoise in a petite- xs. normally items at retailer run on the larger side and this shirt fit just right (i am 4ft 11inches and 100lbs). the material was a little on the lite side which makes a great summer fit, but it is a bit weak (so it can tear easily). it looks great with all types of skirts and jeans. i just wish retailer would sell more of the petite sizes. i went back in to buy more in other colors and they are sold out already!
other The front cream panel is completely transparent.i didn't purchase because my bra showed and it would ruin the look with a cami underneath.i wish the fabric were translucent - not so see through.
other When i saw this online, i wondered why this dress cost so much. i have been keeping my eye on it for some time. loved what i saw, the design and colors and details at the neckline and waist along with pockets but was skeptical. i was waiting for a sale to take a dive and here are my thoughts when i got it:___________pros:- the colors you see online are exactly the same in person.- the jeweled neckline is lovely. it's one thing that drew me to it. this dress had a very sophisticated appeal wh
other Very cute top but it is wide and runs large. it is very flattering with skinny jeans and the color is a beautiful navy almost a hint of purple. i would consider a size down. may run on the short side for those with longer torsos.
other I ordered this in size xl. the fit is true to size. it fits me as it does on the model. the draping is very flattering. i'm a pear-shape and this shape works well. it definitely needs a tank underneath. you could sew a bit of the top to keep it closed. otherwise, everything can show. i like using different colored tanks to pull out the colors in the pattern.the quality of the material is outstanding. the print looks so much prettier in person. it's very vibrant. the photos online, at least on
other I am partial to maeve tops, i love the prints! i loved the ski print as soon as i spotted it. i think its such a darling shirt for winter. the material is light weight which is perfect for layering, i'm planning on wearing it with my fur vest as well as a knit vest i got at retailer last summer. i got a other (i go between other and 4) because i prefer some room in button down shirts and it fits as planned. i wanted to wait for it to go on sale but i was worried about selling out so i picked up on black f
other I am so amazed that i finally found the perfect, straight legged denim! not too skinny nor too tight b/c i have athletic calves. i have been waiting a long time! for reference i took a size 26 and usually wear a 2. it is great and comfortable for someone my age! i love these and they are the best investment.
other This top is really cute. the fabric is soft with a little stretch to it. the lace shoulders with the denim cutouts add so much to this top. i was afraid it might make it too stiff & bulky around the shoulders, but it doesn't. very cute. the armholes are cut on the bigger side, but not so big that it shows your bra strap or anything.(just comfortable) the cut is also very nice and the pleats make it more body slimming. runs pretty tts. i ordered my usual medium and it's not quite as form fitting
other I love this shirt. the neckline is flattering and the overall feel is very comfy.
other I loved the way it looks on. fit tts. only problem for me was it was so itchy. there is that small amt. of wool in it. if you have any problem with wool this may not work for you
other This skirt is lovely and fits perfectly. the print on the front provides a great contrast to the back of the skirt and stands out. the material is thick enough to take you from fall to winter easily. and the fabric is structured enough to highlight all the right curves. a great purchase.
other I saw a stylist wearing a similar piece from a few seasons ago and commented that i liked it on her. i was told they had a different version (a few actually) and i decided to try it on. it actually is pretty flattering, i had flared jeans on but also could see it with a dress. i left it open, as pictured, tied one button, and also played with the neck and tried a cowl... all very nice.i debated getting my usual xs petite, but hey, they don't make it in petite, and the stylist thought the loo
other Super cute style but runs slightly larger then other ag jeans i have.
other I wanted to love this top, but it unfortunately did not work for me. the material has a nice weight and feel to it, and while i love the pattern, the shape leaves something to be desired. the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms, and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big. the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top. for reference, i am 5'10" 140 lbs and typically a size 6. i wear a small in retailer clothes, and got a small in this top. i think an xs would have been to
other This sweater i bought to go with a navy dress. it is not ivory. it is sortof a blush color???? not at all what i had in mind. the sweater itself is pretty. the back is shorter as someone else described which looks slightly awkward when wearing it. definite return. :(
other Love the dress. runs a little big. i ordered a size down than i normally wear and it fit. versatile too--i even wore it to the office with a black blazer over it and got lots of compliments!
other Modern, unique, versatile; love it paired with the essential culottes. usually size 4/small but got the xs, otherwise the armholes dipped down too low as did the back hem of the sweater (
3 I'm 5'4", usually a small in retailer sizes, 6-8 pants, i purchased the 8 petite
other I love this jacket. it is great for lounging because it is loose and comfortable, and it's great to have pockets to stash stuff in as i shuffle cozily around my house on cold, lazy days. it's not the world's most flattering fit (it's kind of boxy) but i bought it for comfort and i am delighted.
other Soft, slouchy, and comfortable.what more could you ask for?
other I purchased this blazer and its so comfortable. it runs small i am usually a size 6 but had to get it in size 8. i will be getting a lot of use out of this blazer. it can be worn professionally with skirt or solid color dress or casual with jeans. the fabric so very soft almost like a sweatshirt.
other The fit of the dress is fabulous! it is so flattering and true to size. my only complaint is that he lining can be seen at the neckline. it might just be that the one i received is slightly defective. even with this problem, it is a keeper.
other Cute design and interesting back feature. runs a little big and is comfortable and flowy.
other Beautiful, flattering dress. love that you can where a bra without having to be concerned about straps showing. very happy with purchase. highly recommend.
other Huge! normally wear a medium and this was huge and very unflattering.
other Casual dinner out dress love the color, mine is navy.
other I have been wanting this skirt since it came out, and was overjoyed when it went on sale. i got my typical 00 size (24-26 waist, xsmall-xxsmall shirts/dresses), but when i tried it on i was a bit confused. the waist is a little roomy,so there's no way i could wear a 0, but the skirt hugs my butt. and i'm talking in that weird "hug the butt but flares out awkwardly below way". now i don't consider myself particularly gifted in the back end department, but this skirt sure says the opposite! i can'
other I love this blouse! the colors of the little sunglasses are vibrant against the black background, the buttons on the front are also a coral/peach color and beautifully made. its thin enough to be worn in the summer or fall without making you sweat or freeze. i ordered a medium, which i usually wear in most retailer tops and it fits perfectly. i'm a 36b and can run from an 8 to a 10 in tops. i do recommend trying it on before purchasing if you can, especially for women with a larger bust. th
other The uniqueness of this top caught my eye online. i normally wld not want a long sleeve top in the summer. a bit warm to wear outside now but i like the casual but unique style of it. it's a top i can wear now but only indoors with a/c. the regular small fits fine. a little oversized & sleeves a little long - as in the pic. the color/style/detaling is exactly as in the pic - no surprises. soft & comfy. a little opaque but a nude bra will work fine. i don't see the need for a tank/cami under it. i
3 So small! i was a solid size 1other in skirts but recently lost some weight. i was still nervous to buy a size 10 so i bought the 1other thinking i can always take it in if i have to. the 1other - which should have been big on me was tiny. this skirt is built for someone with non-existent hips. returning.
other I love this tunic. the knit is soft and comfortable and very easy to wear. i purchased "moss" and can change the look of the outfit by adding various accessories. the slits on the side are cut rather high and i have found that jeans or leggings of a thicker fabric look best.
other I ordered this in xs and it fits loosely (i am 5'3" and about 120 lbs). this looks great with skinny jeans or leggings and shows off the long necklaces that are in style right now. the chiffon doesn't lie perfectly along the side seam, but i'm sure only i notice.
other Like the crossover design of this sweater. the v-neck is not low cut and can be worn without cami. sweater is thin but not find it to be see through although i always were tank tops under my shirts. did not find it to be itchy.
other Since there was only one review on this i thought i would chime in. i had been eyeing this for months and was able to get it on sale which was a plus since this had a pretty hefty price tag to start. that being said, the tailoring and detail work on it is just beautiful. i am a little worried about how the knit will wear but not worried enough to return it! as far as sizing goes, i ordered a other in the last byron lars dress and i am a other in this too. it fits snugly, but a 6 would have looked lumpy
3 I was so excited to find this dress in the store! i immediately headed for the dressing room to try this beauty on....what a disappointment. the fabric is stunning, but the fit is extremely voluminous . i am normally a small to medium, so i grabbed a small......the only way to describe this dress is tentlike!  it was huge from the waist down. i don't think i could size to an xs because i am a 34d and the top half of the dress fit perfect!  i was sad to leave the store without this dress.
other I tried this top on at store and didn't want to buy at full price even though it made my heart skip a beat with how adorable it was. it is even cuter on. so when i saw it finally went on sale and i got an additional 20% off i immediately ordered!!!! it is flowy, comfortable and fun. wore it today layered with a black turtleneck and long black vest.
other In my opinion, the quality and uniqueness of this piece far definitely warrants a full price purchase. adorable cut and style, comfortable and cute. it's the perfect flexible top to wear to work with a skirt or more casually with your favorite pair of jeans. love this!
other This dress is beautiful. i cannot begin to express how pleased i am with the design and timelessness of this dress. in my mind, it takes me back to the 20s and 30s more so than a flapper dress as it exudes the simplicity yet elegance of the early 20th century. the champagne color is light and airy and it is incredibly comfortable to wear. i am wearing this to a musical at the tuts theatre in two weeks with pearls.
other I ordered this dress in a 1other which is my usual size and it was tight around the waist and across the back. i am 5'7 170lbs, small chest but broader shoulders and back and curvy butt. this dress is beautiful quality and well made but was too snug. it was very long, to the point where i would only be able to wear heels. the belt is cheap looking, i would recommend replacing it with something nicer. the waist drops slightly below the natural waist and the top puckers over it in the front and back.
other The first reviewer said it was small in the bust, but the 0p i ordered fit everywhere, rib cage and all, but was gaping at the bust (in the back). i would say overall it was true to size but if i sized down, it would be too snug in the rib cage. i am 30dd for reference there and waist is 26.other inches,otherwise, the make is very pretty, i like the texture in the fabric, the color is very pretty as well. embroidery seemed high quality, but i decided to pass on it, even on sale, since it didn't
other I ordered the green/teal in size xl. the fit on me doesn't match the model. it looks looser on her. i think it runs small, at least in size xl. it still is a comfortable fit since the material has stretch. the pleat at the top helps the drape of the shirt. it's a beautiful color of green too. i think the v-neck is too low so i wear a tank underneath. this also helps with the transparent panels at the shoulders/back. my other dolan tops have held up well and retained their color through washing s
3 Beautiful dress, but it just didn't look that flattering on me. the quality was nice and it looked just like the picture. unfortunately it just looked shapeless on me so i had to return it. the dress is probably more flattering if you have long legs to show off, i definitely don't!
other This dress is perfect for any occasion, it looks great with every shoe and is flattering on.
3 I wanted to love these pants since i hate super-fitted skinny pants. but they are really oversized. i'm 125lbs and other foot 2. so i'm petite but not considered skinny and have well endowed thighs and legs.but the xs was way too big for me.
other I am very pleased with this purchase. a nude colored racer back bra works perfectly under it and does not show through.   i have worn this with jean shorts and linen pants and it looks great with both. it is slightly on the dressy side so i also plan to wear it to work  paired with a skirt or dress pants and a cardigan.   i am a 34a  and size small  fits nicely.
other Man do i love this dress! love the fit and the quality of the fabric, lays really nicely. i gave it only four stars because it is super short. true i am 5'11" but there is no way i could wear this without pants or leggings. i am super bummed because i really love it but must send it back.
other I agree with the previous reviewer that the length is not at all what is shown in the picture. much shorter than that. and while the overall detail of the skirt is very nice, the elastic waistband makes it look cheap considering the price...
other This is a beautiful, simple, yet feminine top. a little tight in the bust on me - so i had to size up (and i am not busty). for reference, i am 117 5'3 34b. i'm probably in between a small and x-small on this - but went with the small.
other I tried this on in the store and loved it. it runs large. i'm 5'7", 130lbs, very short waisted, and i got the xs. i realized it had a sheer section on the side, but the store paired it with a beautiful scarf that helped cover the sheerness. i didn't feel i needed a cami while wearing the scarf. plus the scarf will keep me warmer and let me wear the shirt a little longer in the fall.
other The pattern is pretty subtle, almost looks like one color, so it is more versatile as i would have originally thought. the fabric is so soft, the collar is removable, but i love the look with it on. the way it closes is 3 lobster-like clasps, so you can wear it closed or open. sizing is a bit big, as in the xxs p fit me perfectly (didn't even try on the xs p. this will keep me warm, and looked nice with a pant outfit i tried on as well as a dress... recommend (sizing reference: 11other lbs, 30dd, 26
3 Nice fabric, very versatile but the knit top and style accentuates your bust. probably not an issue for most but if your a d or up it's more attention than you may want.
other This is such a good dress to just throw on and go! the inside is lined with fleece so it's basically a giant sweatshirt. it does run large. i normally wear a medium and i bought the small but could have bought the xs if the difference in length between the two hadn't been about a foot. (i am tall). the color is actually a light mint, not the grayish blue it appears in the picture. overall a great purchase though.
3 I loved the look of the dress. it's a very flattering design. however, i absolutely hate the side zipper. every time i have worn it, the zipper will get stuck and it is a struggle to get it up. the side tie is a very cute touch, but you definitely have to figure out the best way to tie it, so you don't have a huge bump of fabric on your back. having said all this, i still did get a lot of compliments from this dress. i do wish the dress had a lining.
other Fell in love with this the moment it arrived in stores. whimsical but work--appropriate. i'm typically a other in dresses. i would say this skirt runs tts; however, the front pleats will create a pouch-y stomach if you have a small waist and a lucious anything-below-your-waist. size up one size to avoid this. the waist size will be loose, but it will allow the pleats to lay flat. absolutely lovely with a mock neck sleeveless top. also great with solid white, black, or printed blouses. not a true pen
other I love this dress. i think the cut, fabric and embroidery are all flattering. this dress is comfortable and can be dressed up or down. i am 5'other and weigh anywhere from 108-113 lbs. i at first tried on the xxs petite and liked the look but found it to be tight in the arm area. they didn't have an xs petite so i tried on the s petite to see if there was any major difference. there totally was! so i ordered the xs petite online and can't wait to get it!!
other Unlike the other reviewers, i did not have any problem with the sizing, fit or length of this skirt. it is a midi skirt so i think it's suppose to be a little bit longer?? for me it fit true to size. for reference i am 5'8", 13other pounds and the size 6 fit perfectly. i think the color is beautiful and the quality is good.
other I saw this dress a few weeks ago in the store, tried it on but didn't have anywhere in mind to wear it so i passed. noticed it on sale online and had to order. it is so comfortable and flattering. the material is thicker therefore it keeps a nice shape. not slinky at all.
other Spotted this beauty in my local store - hanging (grrr) which made it stretch out. note that it's made of linen, cotton, and acrylic, so it's not heavy, it's weighty. anyways, it seemed to run large just due to gravity, so i ended up ordering it so it wasn't all stretched out. it's got a beautiful a-line cut - perfect for us bottom-heavy gals. love the colored thread woven throughout. worth the extra $.
other I love the details of this top, from the pleating to the sleeves, the pommed edges and the black lace at the bottom. the material is soft and comfortable. the fit is flowy and the details are feminine yet simple. it's light weight which will be nice in warm weather. and let me say once more how much i love the sleeves.
other I love this coat but it does not work for my body type. it is a beautiful coat and of very good quality. it has a wonderful lining which is so nice to see as many of the "coats" retailer is carrying right now are not lined. the coat is soft and feels so good. it seems to run true to size. i would have purchased this if the button placement were higher up. the button closure is right at my hips ( i am 5'6" for reference) and i am pretty curvy. when open, the coat looked great but when i trie
other I like the detail in this cardigan. the shape is true to the fit on the model of the main picture, the sleeves are a bit long, however i am 5'2.other and 107 lbs, i ordered and kept the xxsp. great staple item!
other This gorgeous dress is what retailer is all about. natural fibers like silk and rayon and cotton, unusual beautiful prints and colors, not your average day to day find. i bought this in my usual size l, and while i could use a bit more room in the top, it works either unbuttoned one button, which shows the beautiful turquoise slip that comes with it, or, i am going to stitch it down the front so the buttons won't open and the top won't gap at the bust. i am 5'5" and the dress is a perfect l
3 This shirt is thin and probably not worth full price, but it was flattering to my figure. covered my post baby tummy and complimented/minimized my g size chest, but the cut was off. the seams for the arms were almost in the front at the chest, so when i moved my arms i had limited movement forward and it pushed the embroidered panel out and was just irritating. an entire day of readjusting my shirt would drive me crazy. i tried the m and the l.
other I'd been eyeing this dress since i first saw it in the dress catalog when it came out. when i saw it in person, it was just as beautiful as i remembered! i'm about 140 lbs and usually wear a size s or m, but i tried the s on and decided to size down to an xs, because the linen flowy fabric lays a bit wide when on the body; however, the s would have worked, too! i'd say size down if you prefer your clothes a tiny bit more fitted. the fabric is beautiful and lightweight, even though there is more
other The textured marled stripes on this top are so soft and give this pullover the edge it needs. a few people have asked me where i bought this from and i've only worn it twice. fits like the photo- i'm 5'2" 115lbs and bought the xs.
3 The dress arrived with two large buttons missing from the front complete with unraveling threads. the rest of the buttons are sewn on loosely, and in general, it's poor quality. ridiculous considering the price, very disappointed.
other I love this dress, it is very photo friendly which is a big plus for me. i am not the tallest person, 5'4" but i had to be careful not to get my sleeves in the food i was preparing. perhaps the sleeve length is a bit longer on me, but i had to be very cautious while trying to put the finishing touches on our holiday feast. it's just something to be aware of. i suggest sushi or a nice cheese plate if you want to wear it as the hostess.
other Was so excited to see that this colorful top came in petite sizes! it fits perfectly and so happy that it doesn't fall too long. looks great with a longer cardigan sweater. very happy with this find .
other Well made gorgeous skirt that can be worn with heels and lace top or tee shirt and big jewelry. true to size. i am a 2/other and the extra small was great. poofs out a bit but not like you're a fairy. i would say the blue (which i ordered) is more of a seafoam / mint green which is also lovely and spring time.
other This is a gorgeous dress... great print, comfortable fabric (very wrinkly, though). runs very small. i'm usually a 00 or even sized out at retailer and will need to size up to a 2.
other I got this in the red and the black.i returned the red,for it doesn't compare to the black one.i would have loved it,if it was a red dress with white flowers.i didn't like it being a white dress with red flowers.the black one is the one to pick!
other Love it!! it does run big so i had to return for smaller size. fabric is nice very true to picture
other I love everything about this dress. the style, fit, colors and design of fabric, quality and feel of fabric. so happy and highly recommend!
other I loved the fabric and this print but it was just cut a little wrong for me. the gathering on the side made me look a bit wide. but the fabric is beautiful and everything else was nice. i did like the fact that it ties in the back so you can slim down the sillouhette (sp?) if you want to.
other Got this dress on sale. it fits great. i am 5'8", small bust, small waist but bigger hips. and this dress makes all those areas look great.
other This is a great dress. i purchased the red and gold motif. i like that it is versatile and very comfortable. plus, it has pockets!!! love that! i am fuller in the bottom, so i was concerned with the pockets adding bulk. so far, so good.
other I ordered not one but two sizes of this dress to try on and was hoping to ultimately wear to an event - one 00 petite, one 00. the style, color and cut are all perfect. one not so minor downfall, however. the zippers on both dresses were faulty - they both broke in the same spot, both during the first time just trying them on. i can't get either of them to even budge now - will either need to take back or get fixed. very sad about this.
other I saw this in the store and loved the feel of the fabric but did not want to pay full price. i was very happy when it went on sale. the top clings nicely without feeling tight. i got sp (5'5, 125)as i worried the neckline would slip off. fits perfectly. fabric has a very slight sheen. i just hope it holds up to washing and caution is needed as you may create pulls with jewelry if careless.
other Ordered this cover up in a mp but it was waaay too big so now waiting for the sp to arrive! hope its a hit!
3 I ended up returning it just because it didn't do much for my current postnatal figure, but otherwise this top is just so pretty and unique!
other Love this brand, wish there was more available. always a perfect fit and excellent quality! great color, more rich and red than what you see in pic.
other I felt comfortable wearing this to a party. easy to wear and accessorize.
other Great light weight sweater. perfect for spring. runs true to size. definitely will buy another color.
3 If the sweater looked as it does in the picture, i would keep it. however, it was very boxy and short, a style that does not work for me at all. i'm other ft. 6 in. and ordered the medium. i suspect the sweater on the model may be clipped back to make it look more form fitting. unfortunately i will have to return the sweater.
other Great quality, i didn't expect the neck to be so wide but it still looks nice.
other This is by far my favorite romper. it is very flattering and the material feels wonderful against the skin.
other The knit is thin.  it's more for a chilly spring or warm fall day.  but, it's not see-through, although a bit light weight.the style if figure-flattering and fits tts.  i am short and i found the sleeves, length perfect.  so if you are tall, you "might" find this shorter in the arms or body on you.i bought the purple and it's a great color.  love it!
other Can dress it up or down and still look good in it! i wear leggings under it to keep my legs warm since the material is thin and i live near the ocean. this is my new standard summer dress! i bought an xxs since i am petite weighing 95lbs and stand 5'1"
other I purchased this dress in other colors...beautiful and so comfortable. highly recommend
other This dress is really pretty, but the fit is off. it is not fitted at the waist which made the back look poofy. also, the arm length is not flattering; it needs to be either longer or shorter. additionally, if one was to wear it a lot, the felting might start to fray.
other This dress is beautiful - the pictures do not do it justice. i love the fabric and overall feel of the dress - light and airy. i have very broad shoulders and i did not feel like it look good on me so i am sending it back. too bad for me! i think the dress is perfect for weddings, parties and even everyday wear.
other Soft and pretty, but way too big and wide. love the bell-sleeve detail. i'm exchanging for one size smaller.
other This shirt is very comfortable to wear, mostly because the buttons are well placed. many button down shirts bother me because they gape open at the bust area, but the buttons on this one are placed at just the right spot.
other I am between a xs and s but figured i would order down based on the reviews. well, it's still huge. i have about other inches that i can take in from the side. i have ordered the xxs and am hoping it will look more flattering. i love the colors and design, but as it is it does not do anything for me. for reference i am 12other lbs, 32d, 5'5".
other Tts. i'm 38c, 8-10 and m fits just right. nice and fitted at the top, flowy skirt. i got the cream and love the skirt pattern.
other The model does not look as good in this shirt as it looks in real life. it is flowy, flattering, and elegant, not to mention warm and soft. i hope it holds up!
other I absolutely love this top!! i bought the ivory color, and i am definitely considering buying the black as well! it feels true to size, but i did size up only because i like my tops to fit a little generous and flowy. i can't wait to wear this top all season long!
other This product looks great on the model, but for anyone with a normal body type, the band in the center is way too tight. i'm a 34a and wear a 27 pants and it was huge in the bust and too small in the waist and hips. the violet one looks much more blue in the photograph, it is truly lavender and purple. i really wanted to love this swimsuit, but instead i had to return it, pay for return shipping, and i am out about $20 now. very disappointed.
other I love these shorts. i don't understand why they aren't sold out yet! they are buttery soft and fit great. i usually wear a size 26 and these are true to size. they are my go to run around shorts but because they are a dark wash so i feel like i can wear them out with a cute top to dinner even. love!!
other The photos shown here really do not do this bomber jacket justice! the colors of the embroidery are much deeper and richer in person! it is very well made, having no loose threads whatsoever. the retailer store where i bought mine featured this jacket over an ivory color lace blouse and it looked much more stunning than over the darker color that they show it here with. it does run true to size as the other reviewer mentioned too. i took my usual size large. i would say that if you're betwe
other I ordered these jeans to wear to work since they are very dark and tailored. my usual size 26 fit perfectly, but they did have to go to the tailors since they were incredibly long, which is nice for those of you that need more length.given that i usually am in skinnies, i like how they fit singly on the hips and slightly flare out towards the bottom, but not too much. these will work well with a variety of looks, making the price tag well worth it.
other Bought them in store and have worn them twice. very flattering! they have maintained their shape through the day. i'm 5/4" and usually wear a 31" inseam, and these are perfect ankle length. i'm tempted to buy another color!
other Unique jacket..... but when i put it on i felt and looked like charlie brown. this will be going back.
other Bought this because i don't have a puffer vest and living in san diego, i wanted a layering piece. it's much cuter on, but it does like much of retailer's clothes run a bit small. got tons of compliments on it when i wore it while shopping round town. very pricey but since the hood detaches and it's reversible, i guess it's worth it! (treat yo'self!)
other I really loved the dress in the picture. it is reallynice quality. unfortunately it was really long. i am5'other and it was about 8 inches too long. hemming itwould have ruined the details of the dress. they werebackordered on petites in my size ,so, i just returned it.
other I have literally dozens of deletta tops. just four things to know: very unique/attractive, run large/stretch out (size down), poor quality fabric, and usually low cut.
other I ordered this shirt with some trepidation after reading the one-star reviews. i was, however, pleasantly surprised when the shirt arrived and i put it on. i agree the sleeves are a bit on the slim side, noticeable mostly because the fabric doesn't have any give. the shirt fabric itself is both billowy and substantial and the embroidery work gives the shirt an expensive (because it is) and unique look. the shirt body is not as slim cut as it appears in the pictures; the darts open out to a much
other This dress is really stunning - can be dressed up or down with a jean jacket really easily. runs quite a bit small in the bust (i ordered a 16 to accommodate) but it is really very pretty. i love this brand- they always have such lovely pieces.
other I bought this dress after i had overnighted a different one and it wasn't going to be delivered on time. i'm so happy that i bought this dress. its so comfortable and easy to wear. i got lots of compliments on it.it runs very large though. i ended up with a size 6. i initially tried on the 10, as i have a larger chest. the 6 still had plenty of room.
other Beautiful top, but delicate! i wore it to school and the straps on my backpack caused some pilling. other than that it is beautiful and vibrant! just make sure you aren't doing/wearing anything that will rub it continuously since the fabric is delicate
other This is different from any bra i've had before, in a good way. the lace over the front is really beautiful, and no annoying straps means it's comfortable! fit and support are both great. i didn't notice that it was silk when i ordered, so it was a nice surprise to open something so luxe and elegant. i wasn't expecting an underwire, either, based on the s-m-l sizing, but it has one.
3 This dress is well made and of good quality it just looked a little too old on me. the skirt was heavy and the fabric was cozy, perfect for a fall outfit.
other I just received this in the green color. it is a true medium jade green. my monitor shows a blue color and that is what i expected. the green is pretty but i would have preferred the blue that was shown. i found this to fit large . the pockets that are barely visible in any of the photos gape open and don't lie flat. i do like this sweater as a very casual jacket alternative on cooler days. the cashmere is a nice weight and is not too precious to wear every day with jeans.
other I bought the blue/green color. it was absolutely beautiful...i paired it with a green sweater jacket for inside and took the sweater off as it warmed up. very comfortable, versatile, flexible and the color is rich. i am 5'other and 147 pds and the m fit perfect.
other I love the fleetwood style...very trendy...fit like a dream - very long for you leggy gals. me, i need to hem (these would also look cute as cutoffs for us shorties)...true to size - slim fit!
other This shirt runs true to size. i'm an xl and it fit perfectly! that is my first reason for loving it. it is super soft and so comfortable i don't want to take it off! the trim inside the cuffs and button line is navy with large white polka dots, which i love. the ruffle of the shoulders i'm not super wild on but it does give it a touch of different. the color of the photo is very accurate. i love the muted pink in the plaid.
other These pants are really pretty and comfrotable, and i took a cahnce ordering them with a "3other inch inseam:, i thought perhaps they would work with a 4-inch heel...howeverm it is not the case, tey much be much longer than 3other inches. due to the cut out i will not be able to have htem hemmed, so htey must go back. if you are taller, i recommend, they are truly flattering.
other This shirt style is boxy, however, the material is soft and this shirt is very comfortable. i love the look of the cuffs. this is a fun shirt to wear
other Classic tank with the perfect fit!soft aqua perfect for summer.fit is very true to size!
other I loved this shirt so much i bought it in other colors. however, two of them shrunk. i was very disappointed.
other This sweater carries alot of weight, more than it appeared. the yellow is more of a bright green/yellow- not a soft color as pictured. it is still a nice layering piece.
other Love this shirt. it is long enough in back to wear with leggings. it is very cute and casual on. not fitted at all. i am 5'other and ordered a regular size so that it fits longer.
other Bought the green/blue - colors are bright, fabric is so soft. the neckline is just right for a small chest. the top is structured nicely, giving you a figure flattering fit.
other I accidentally found this gem at my store today. i adore layering my style, and this is a perfect edition. it's light, but has enough weight to it that it has some movement and doesn't stick to other fabric. i wouldn't quite call it "gauze" since its heavier than your typical gauze. it's super long. i'm 5'8 and it definitely went to my knees. when worn buttoned up, it's clean and classic. when worn open, it's cool, bohemian and edgy...while still looking totally put together. i adore this. wish
other I love the look of this bra, but unfortunately it is pretty skimpy and sheer. i need a little more padding to define my shape and i wish it had modesty padding. this wasn't for me so i returned it.
3 I desperately wanted this to work - it's a beautiful color and overall quality...it is just so short and wide (almost a perfect square if you lay it out flat). i can see it looking better on someone on the shorter side, but on my 5'7" frame and long torso it just didn't look right. few extra inches and this could have been awesome!
other I purchased this top in the xs and was so excited to receive it as i love the layered look snd the back of the sweater was so cute online! the sweater itself is lovely, but it was a tent on me! waaaaay too big for my 5'3" frame. if you're a taller gal or someone who likes more volume in their swing tops, this is for you. unfortunately, i had to return it.
other This dress is great! i purchased the navy colorway. it is really soft and the fabric flows nicely. i was lucky enough to snag this on sale so i couldn't beat the price. i like the buttons on the sleeves. it adds just a cute special touch. i'm 5'3 and this hits me right at the knee.
3 The dress is great for pear shapes. however, i do feel it runs larger than typical retailer sizing. ordered a small (5'8" 140#) and i still think it may be a bit big. the material is very comfortable, not too thick or thin. however, i feel the shaping on the bottom is a little bulky due to the fabric. see the attached photo.
other I'm a 32ddd and this top fit perfect. i wore it with boyfriend jeans and flats. the material is nice and perfect for fall
other Looking forward to wearing this on chilly spring mornings. ordered in the navy. fits true to size.
other Great blouse for curvy women. i'm always an xl in retailer tops, and even then sometimes the xls can be too tight to keep. however, i was so happily surprised with this blouse. the arms are usually an issue for me, but the arms in the blouse are perfect and loose in the bicep area. this blouse fits beautifully and is really high quality. the blouse lays nicely everywhere. i plan to wear it with a pair of gray pants so the lace cut out at the bottom shows up more. the lace is heavy duty and doesn't
other A wonderfully heavy weight piece, opposed to all the swingy chambray of summer, this piece will transition wonderfully into fall. the only disadvantage is a relatively high neck, which looks lovely but can be a little restrictive at times. highly recommend!
other Yes! this dress is so lovely. i wear a size 6. a size 6 in this was perfect. under slip over a delicate overlay. heading to italy and this will be so perfect. drape is so flattering. colors are feminine. cut is lovely. effortlessly elegant and reads much more expensive. don't hesitate. a special one.
other I bough the blue color and love it. the neckline detail is fun and make you take a double take when looking at what is otherwise a relatively simple top. it drapes nicely, and paired nicely with dark skinny jeans and ballet flats for work (i'm at a tech company, so casual to business casual). the ombre color is gorgeous! (the lavender is pretty too but seemed to wash me out and not fall as nicely).regarding what other reviewers said: yes, it has a slightly vinegar smell when it came shipped, b
3 I was really looking forward to getting this dress in the orange print, but when i finally received, i was a little disappointed. the print placement is not the same as shown on the model, so it doesn't look as a vibrant and colorful. my version of the dress has more of that muddy dark print and hardly any orange or turquoise. also the backside of the print is white and the dress is not lined. i do like the way it drapes on my body and the overall styling. the dress fits nicely in size medium on
other What a find! this skirt is so soft and fits like a dream. perfect shape and length. i've been looking for more pieces to match a couple of fabulous pairs of purple shoes i have, so this is just the ticket!
other I like this top a lot, and have always liked knotted looks around the bust area. i do not have a large chest, and this kind of top always draws attention in all the right places. i was worried the cut would be too low for my comfort level-and it is low but the shirt does not come away from my body in normal movements so i do feel completely comfortable wearing this without a cami underneath. i don't prefer this in black because i think the color detracts from the bunches of fabric created by the
other I love denim and this tunic/dress/shirt is soft and fits really well except its almost too long to be a tunic/shirt but too short to be a dress - at least for me but i have a long torso - still not sure if i should keep it.
other Cute and comfortable! i loved the colors and how soft the shirt is!
other This is a comfortable skirt that can span seasons easily. while not the most exciting design, it is a good work skirt that can be paired with many tops.
other So this top is kind of short, but that is pictured. it hits right where it does in the photo, which i like. it is a sheer material, not terribly so, but you will most likely need a cami, which you could pair a long one with to offset the shorter top if you don't like the shortness. i love the top, it's very pretty detailing, cute, just as pictured. i ordered a size other and it fits great. i usually wear petites, but you really don't need to get a petite because it's short as it is. i have broad sho
other I purchased this top as a swim suit cover-up and it is perfect! i was counting on the model in the photo being tall so that the top would be longer on me and that was true. great product.
3 I like the look of this tee and the fit is fine but it's described as a "cotton-rayon jersey" and in fact it's 50% polyester. i would not have ordered if i had known and now have to take it back.
other I bought this shirt along with a matching vest and duster........love it!
other This is very cute. it's lined, it's smocked. it's longer on me than the model in the picture. i was a bit concerned about the short length but the skirt actually came to just above my knees, which works well for me. it might run a tad big because it is a pull of skirt. i look forward to wearing this light weight skirt on hot days his summer!!
other Nice quality fabric and design, but found the armhole cut weirdly and fit of upper bodice strange. wanted to love it but sadly sent it back
other I ordered the lavender version in xl. it fit me as shown on the model so i think it runs true to size. it is a little shorter than shown. it hits my waist & i'm other ft. other 1/other in. for reference. it fits close through the arms & body but with a comfortable, stretchy material. a tank underneath is needed. i love the draping. it's very flattering. the color is more of a gray than purple. i took the chance on it when it was on sale and it's now a favorite. great neckline for wearing necklaces too.
other I love this dress. i wish i had ordered a size bigger because now its out of stock. if you are between sizes order a size up. i'm in between a other and a 6 petite and ordered the size other and the dress is too tight in the bust. the dress has no give so it has to fit perfect. it is so lovely i don't want to return it. i will try to find a seamstress to help with the fit. my favorite part of the dress are the side pockets. they're big and adorable.
other I noticed this vest hanging in my local store and tried it on on a whim because it felt so soft. i usually wear an xs or s in retailer's clothing so i tried on the xs/s and felt it was true to size - it's obviously large, but that's because that is the style! the shoulders fell perfectly. i was in love from the moment i put it on! while it's not my normal style, it was so soft and beautiful and it flowed perfectly, plus the extra fabric allowed for a bit of "cozying up" in colder weather by wrappi
other It's not them it's me. so sad. ordered two sizes 2other r and 2other p. nothing about them worked for me. i loved the colors (blue and green). i loved" the fabric (heavy washed soft cotton). i loved the style. ah but there is the rub. i am so small that the width of the legs just swallowed me up. whereas the 24s fit around the waist and the length, while longer than i'd have liked was doable, there was just so much fabric around my skinny legs i felt as though i was wearing huge balloons on each leg. (t
other I've been looking for dresses to wear to nurse in since i just had a baby & so i bought this dress knowing it just had a tack holding the front fold together & always intending to remove the tack. i love it. the fabric is super soft. i wear it with a nursing tank underneath and a wide belt to cinch my waist & it's amazing. with the tack in, it did pull very strangely across the bust as others have mentioned, so it's not good for a big bust unless you intend to remove the tack & wear something un
other This top is cute love the ruffle sleeves. the store i got these had both colors so ended getting both colors because the top is cute. does run a little large i ended up going a size down.
other I saw the two star review and wanted to share my opinion. i saw this item that had been returned to a store and i love it. the fabric is a bit sheer and i think will require a nude tank underneath, but i think it's adorable. don't be scared away by the review below!
3 Online this top looks fabulous, but in person, not so great. great color, nice quality for a lightweight top, but when i tried it on, the neck does not lay nicely. too much sloppy wrinkled material just hanging awkwardly around the neck ( and i love cowl neck). i found, for me, it dipped very low showing cleavage and i have a large chest, so didn't work. for reference, i'm 5'other 118 and usually wear a small in retailer tops because it seems the majority of their clothes run large. i purchased a smal
other I want to love this top - it is so pretty, but i find the fit very odd. i think it runs big, but the arm holes seem to be cut really low. i would love to size down, but then i think the sleeves would be off. unfortunately, i will have to return it.
3 I really liked the top once i saw it, but it needs to be worn with a cami underneath. the fabric is a little stiff. it runs true to size and it fits like a peplum top with extra space around the waist. the top is not really crocheted by hand it was done by machine, but it is a nice top.
other This is a beautiful blouse that runs one to two sizes too small. i usually wear an 8, maybe a 10 on a bad day. i couldn't get into the 8, the 10 was uncomfortably tight, and even the 1other was snug (i haven't worn a size 1other anything since i was pregnant years ago). i think this blouse would look best on a woman without any curves as it adds curves to any woman's body. since i already have curves, i felt like jessica rabbit in this blouse. it was too much for me. again, lovely blouse, but i would no
other I'm not entirely sure if this shirt just runs large or if it fits oddly/boxy. the flowered material puffs out on the sides a couple of inches under my arms... i'm usually a pretty solid size medium, but i think i'm going to try to exchange this for a small to see if that solves that weird fit issue, because it is a nice idea of a design and comfortable overall. but, if that doesn't solve the trick, if not recommend, b/c that side puffiness isn't flattering.
other I also sized down, and i'm glad that i did. i had been watching this top for awhile and was glad to get it on sale. it is not thick- more of a top than a sweater.
other I purchased this in the light red, and love it!!! this top is so incredibly soft and ridiculously comfortable.  definitely worth buying.  the material is high quality and can easily shift from season to season.  wear alone with shorts and wedges for summer or put it over a long sleeve top,  or even a holding horses jean shirt with a pair of black leggings and boots for fall.  absolutely love the softness and the consistency of the fabric.
other These leggings were everything i expected them to be. they are well made, and the material is thick enough that i can wear them outside in the colder months of the year. the pattern on the website is accurate, and the waistband is comfortable and flattering. would definitely buy again!
other This may be one of my favorite purchases from retailer in a long time. i really appreciate the unique design, a quality that has drawn me to retailer for years. the cute little quirky owls are as rich in color as they are in personality. i'm don't typically favor cheaper polyester blends though the texture feels fine on my skin. this top definitely runs small and i had to size up to get the fit and length i desired. overall, i am very pleased and have received lots of compliments after wearin
other This top is even more beautiful and vibrant in person, but you definitely need a racerback cami underneath it as the laser cuts are big. the first time i wore it today, i got a number of compliments. a definite keeper.
other I love the fit and the color. i would buy this t-shirt again in other patterns and colors. the fabric is thin and lightweight, but i knew that when i bought it. ( apparently, nothing this is a problem for some others.) i do choose to wear a camisole or a tank top underneath it. to preserve the fabric, i hang dry after laundering. the colors have not faded, and the fabric is holding up well. i am 5'4", weigh 13other lbs, and do typically wear size medium.
other You can't tell by the photo but the top is actually a slightly shiny material...so it gives it a classy, going out look. in the picture it looks more casual, but i can see myself wearing this on a night out with a skirt, wearing it to work, or whatever. i tried it on and i thought "wow, i look thin." it's a little shorter than i normally wear (don't worry, it's not a crop top, but notice where the bottom hem sits on the models hips, probably mid-rise), but it looked amazing on. zippers in the ba
other Don't think the photo does this skirt justice. it's a very flattering fit, the kind of skirt you'll wear all summer!
other I decided to order this skirt to look at it and regret it now as i want to keep it. one bummer is the smallest size (xs) runs big, the skirt falls on my lower waist aka hips on me, not on my waist. bu i love the look, it has pockets where the pattern reverts the fabric is soft and thick, making the skirt structured. the length was nice on me, though ti is a mini and there is no petite size, the hem still was above my knee, and therefore was acceptably flattering. the colors are also nice for fal
other This top is super flattering and comfortable. perfect summer wear!
other This yellow/mango color is so beautiful in person. i actually don't have the best skin tone for shades of yellow, but i couldn't resist trying this one on & it turned out to be perfect! the silhouette is very feminine, especially around the neckline & shoulders. there is a lot of fabric, but i actually appreciate that the dress is substantive. finally, the nicest thing is that the dress can easily be dressed up or dressed down depending on how you accessorize it. looking forward to summer!
other I love the look of this shirt. it is super soft and has a great draping quality. i personally love that the mid-stomach seem is see through, but if you didn't like that, you could easily wear a tank under it. overall good buy!
other When i tried on this bathing suit, i decided to not try on any others. it was just right! i usually find bathing suit shopping difficult and no fun--as i can never find a suitable bathing suit. this suit looks nice/flattering, and i can also move around in it and it stays in place. i purchased it in the navy and i'm going to order it in another pattern as well. it looks modern and classic; it's a chic style. i'm a size 6 in dresses, and i purchased a size 10 in this bathing suit.
other I thought this was a fun piece to have, but didn't realize how versatile it was until i got home and started mixing it with either casual shoes, or dressing it up with fancier accessories.i love this jumpsuit!it is well made, and the fabric is of a quality that lends itself to both casual and dressy
3 I have been looking for flares that are not tight through the thigh and these are definitely them...but for me they were so long that to hem them would ruin the style of the pants. i'm 5'other and have long legs but i would need a high heel to maintain the intended style, and that's not what i was looking for. otherwise, beautiful.
other Love the fabric fit and cut of this skirt. it hits at just the perfect spot but runs a little large and is more flattering when sizing down (atleast on me) .
other Debated for a while about this dress...love the flower embroidery but i was worried the nude colored top would look drab on. it actually looks nice on my skin (tan-ish, yellow toned), surprisingly. however, there is a noticeable amount of extra room in the waist (i have a 24'' waist. it wrinkles a bit in that area when i move around. i'm not sure if that's a deal breaker or not...i guess now i have even more to debate about. the length is a tiny bit longer on me than on the model #5'0'', 100 lbs
other I bought this sweater/coat as a gift for my mother. she absolutely loves.it. it does seem to run a little large, and the sleeves are especially long. the navy and grey color combo is very nice. it seems like it will be very warm too.
other I think it's prettier in person. the color is a little brighter in reality, and the beading on the lower half is in other colors (green and gray), which isn't apparent in the photo. although i would consider it true to size, it's a full looking top. i'm 5'8', and both the sleeves and the length are not as long on me as they are on the model. it's a bit sheer, but i personally found it to be fine with a nude bra. cute vintage look.
other As previous reviews have stated, this blouse is see through but it is amazing!!! very rich quality and can be dressed up or dressed down. it is well worth the price now that it is on sale!
other I so wanted to love this sweatshirt. it is very soft and seems like excellent quality and material. the pattern is pretty, and i envisioned spending hours cuddled up reading in it. unfortunately, the body of the sweatshirt (particularly the front torso area) was too big, and it popped out around me like a balloon. the arms fit well, so i don't think that i could have gone down a size. i was also not keen on the way the neck hung, which was either very stiff and tall around my neck when unfolded
other I love this faux-fur coat. i wear it both dressed up & down. i usually wear xs but bought s so i could wear sweaters under it and the arms would still be long & i'm happy i did (5'4" 103 for reference). the faux is soft & comfy. it's warm, but not blizzard warm. i get loads of compliments on it when i wear it & "where did you get that?"definitely worth the purchase on sale.
other I saw this jacket in the store and it looks and fit beautiful! it fits tts and is forgiving to the curvy. this is a staple piece to have during the fall or spring. highly recommend.
other Runs extremely large. i got an xs and am 5'4" 115lbs and this would have fit someone who typically wears a size 10-1other and is 5'6" and above. very disappointed with the size. the quality of the fabric wasn't great either. i wanted it to work so bad but just didn't!
other Could not wait to try this on when it arrived, jumpers are tricky in the way they can ride up and become unflattering. not the case here, i usually wear a size 8 but i decided to order a size down for a size 6. i am 5'other and 150 lb. being the fact that i am in the midst of losing weight i thought i would rather it be more snug and this really was just right. the pockets make it casual and cute, while the print and bare shoulder make it fresh and chic. you will love!
other Even though i'm currently at a 34f in the bust the size 1other works for me, although i did install other snaps between the top 3 buttons to keep everything in line. i'm 5'5" and my torso is often too short for regular sized clothes. the straps were too long for me, but to my delight i discovered that this particular dress is designed to unstitch and tailor the strap length with ease. with those small alterations this dress fits like it was made for me, plus the pattern and fabric are top notch. i tried
other This is what i'd been looking for without even knowing it! it's long without being too long, and most importantly - its soft, not scratchy the way so many winter clothes can be. i wasn't sure if i should order the small or the medium so i went with the medium, and it fits great. the weave is just slightly wide, but not to the point where you have to wear a cami or tee underneath, but the fit is loose enough that you can, if you want to for added warmth. i really like it.
other Nice quality. too big for my taste. really liked the style but sleeves were very long.
other Look carefully at the pics of the back. if this style and the color suit you, just go ahead and order this one. it looks just like the pics, and is light, comfortable and true to size. the kind of top you can throw on when you are in a hurry and look great. however, because the back is sheer from halfway down, maybe not for work if you work in an office. moth is one of my favorite brands at retailer and this one is easy-peasy. i am 5'3", 34c/28/38 and ordered the regular s.
other Super cute, flowy, and flattering. i would buy again in a heartbeat.
other I purchased this dress in the raspberry for my best friend's bridal shower and it was such a hit! i got it for the $60 sale price with the additional 40% off sale items that retailer loves so much- it came to $41! i paired it with a chunky gold necklace and it was adorable! so many compliments! i'm typically a medium through and through and this fit me true to size as well. 5'6", between 135-140lbs. the cut of the dress fit me perfectly and the material is amazing. i'd definitely purchase this!
other The price is amazing for this easy and flattering dress. looks great as is or with a scarf, sweater, jacket, you name it! i just couldn't resist getting carried away with this one..
other As a beach cover-up this would be great, but i'm surprised retailer calls this a dress and doesn't show on the model how thin it is. it's pretty sheer and i couldn't get away without layering it.
other I?m mad for plaid but usually for smaller pattern and winter colors. somehow, this top was love at first sight. it looks simple but it?s not. it?s unique in its own way (look at the back, the slightly puffy sleeves, the side slit), and the colors are such a great mix that go with everything. the stylist opened up a couple of side buttons and tied the material to a knot, so cute. i purchased the xs and the fit is the same as shown online (i?m 5?2?, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i know the price seems
other I am sorry to say this blouse is way below all retailer standards. this top should have been placed on sale a long time ago! poor quality in cut, fabric, design. this is a top one would grab at a local box store for 19.99. the colors are not as vibrant. the shoulders ill fitted. and the fabric and threads are very cheap. i was expecting so much more.sorry retailer.....my favorite store to shop!
3 I love the style and color of this jumpsuit. i ordered a petite, and with tall shoes, it's still about 3" too long. the side seam needs to be taken out at the bottom to hem it, so that's a pain in the rear. also, this has a side zipper, but you step through the neckline to put it on. if any part of me was even a tiny bit larger, this would never work. the biggest issue is that it armholes/bust gaps a lot. there should have been a dart from the armhole down towards the bust. i'm hoping to be
other I like the lace-up trend, but most designs are too revealing. this shirt is super sexy, but not immodest. i bought it in black and am now buying another color. to me, the fabric feels soft and thick, very nice.
3 The material is super soft and i could see how this could be a great fall sweater, but the furry portion made the top too bulky. i should've sized down, but even then i think it still would've been a touch boxy. if it was boxy all the way through it'd be fine, but it feels like just the top was bulky while the bottom half was fine. perhaps good for more broad shouldered people. i have very small shoulders. also reminded me too much of a sheepskin rug.
3 I wanted to love this turtleneck. i read the reviews before ordering. i love the color, the weight of the knit, the ribbing. the small fit me perfectly; i am a 34b, not broad shouldered, and on the thin side in my upper body. however, this item has a strange "blousy" fit. the picture of the back view hints at this but it's worse in person. it's like a bell shaped top or even slightly trapezey, which simply doesn't work with my shape. plus, i'm long waisted. i could have made this work had it not
other I just received this dress in the blue and its very small in the ribcage/bust area. i'm 120 lbs, 5'1, 34d bust and i'm always a 2-other regular or a 4-6 petite in this brand. i couldn't even zip up the other regular all the way. i will probably reorder it in a 6 and an 8. great material, beautiful color, great style.
other The fabric of this vest is identical to a old white dish cloth! the cut of this vest is also bad! will be sent back!
other I wear a 25/26 jean and the size s in this bikini bottom was just too small. in photos it looks so cute, but on me it just didn't look like anything special. hopefully the larger size has more pizzazz.
other Love, love this top. it is soft, comfortable, and cute. it is versatile (e.g. i can dress up for work or dress down by throwing on a pair of jeans). the tie at the neck adds a cute detail (if you want it tied). great staple for the wardrobe. i purchased in the black and it is very versatile, not sure how i feel about the print...
other I purchased this beauty in the sophisticated dark green on black friday and it has been in constant rotation. it looks chic and classy, feels comfortable and warm. i only wish it was about other inches longer, i'm 5'other and it hits at low thigh, i prefer just above the knee for a winter dress. very practical for walking around city all day and then being ready for a dinner or drinks in style. love it.
3 So  disappointed that no where in the limiting did it mention this suit is australian in size!! i ordered the 10 (i'm usually an 8 but that was sold out) and the suit arrives and doesn't even fir over my hips. -- the label clearly says 10 australian us 6!  gutted that i have to return this suit because of this sizing issue.  the suit looks to be well made and the design is adorable of it only for.
other Yes! i love the color, the fabric and the fit up top. the skirt, however, is very poofy. i am going to let it hang for awhile (it was an online order) and see if some of that relaxes. otherwise, i will need to return it.
other This is very unique and stylish! the embroidery is stunning plus it is extremely comfortable. it is pretty warm. it does not itch me at all as others have noted.
other Love!!!! i got the green and it goes with so much!
other I love these jeans but be advised that they run a little small in the waist. they work for me but i think they'd work best on those with an hourglass shape. i'm 5'7" and about 11other lbs with a small waist and i wear a 28 in these. but i have hips - the 28 fits perfectly since it has a small waist but accommodates my hips. i love these jeans. great fit, good fabric, great price!
other I ordered this shirt in each color and different sizes: petite, regular, "my" size, a size up and one down!verdict: i ended up in regular size, not petite because i felt the petite was jsut that short and i could feel te cold breeze in the store. i could have gone in the 00, 0, and other #other is my usual size#, but ended up in a 0 only because it was less wide on me. it is, hwoevcer a tiny bit tighter around the back if i cross my arms forward #really, i don't do that move on a daily basis#. colr: i
other Love everything about this top! comfortable yet classy, dress it up or down depending on occasion. beautiful design.
other This is a modern version of the peplum top and very flattering if you don't mind flowy cuts. the material has a nice heaviness to it, and i love the black pebbled effect. 3other d, 130 lbs fit small perfectly.
other I love these! they are a perfect addition to my fall wardrobe, and just like all other pilcro jeans, they are a great fit and true to size.
other I found this dress to be perfect for the winter season. its warm, sleek, and classy. this dress is made in the usa so it is worth the price. i love the opening on the back and find it be flattering. it can be worn with tights for the winter and easily worn without in the summer. a wise investment for my closet!
other I bought this skirt in the blue motif in my usual size large. it is very comfortable, light and it is lined! i wore it with a navy cotton lace meadow rue top from last year, gold gladiator sandals and a long gold retailer necklace.
other I love this dress! easy breezy flowy comfortable & pink! fits a true medium ...would recommend to anyone. makes me a little flirty!
other I went to retailer for a pair of pants and walked out with this tunic in the blue motif and the pilcro cords in dark turquoise. this sweater, like the one i purchased last season by the same designer, is well made and the fabric is luxuriously soft (like cashmere soft). am so excited that the weather is finally cooling down to wear it!
other These shorts are very well made and the embroidery work is beautiful. the dark yellow is a little bit more orangy looking than in the pictures, but is still a pretty color. don't expect any give or stretch with these shorts.
other Fits very strange. odd cut. does not look well on.
other The design of this top is super cute and the material is decent. the only flaw is that despite buying the smallest size (xxsp), it's still very boxy on me. i wish it was more fitted at the waist which would make it much more flattering. however, since i am actually pregnant, this actually works to my advantage, for the time being.
3 This is a cute top that is very soft and comes in nice colors. it's body hugging, but not clingy. i'm 5'5" 120 with square shoulders and a longer torso, and when i initially tried a small i thought it looked ok, but when i tried on the extra small it looked much better. the way the top is cut it fits a bit weird under the arms, as you can see in the photos, but it wasn't enough to keep me from picking up a few colors when it went on sale. i like wearing this under a jacket or cardigan with jeans
3 I loved everything about this shirt except the harm holes are oddly large. i tried on a medium and the arm holes were very large so i thought a small would fit better but it didn't, the fabric is beautiful and the diamond pattern looks amazing up close but i decided to return the top because the arm holes just stuck out so awkwardly.
other I really love the idea behind this. however, the fit doesn't work for me. i'm usually a s or xs in retailer tops, and i often go with xs for sleeveless tops. this one runs small though - the xs was a bit too small on me based on length and width. the neckline was very high (higher than it looks in the model photo) and the armholes were too big. so i don't think sizing up would improve matters much due to the armhole issue. the other criticism is that the front is not lined.
other Fits perfectly! super soft and well-made! love the 3/other sleeves and back drop. i can expect i will wear a lot in this coming fall/winter season in ca. highly recommend!
other Like many of the other reviewers, i thought this ran a little big. i am a 5'5", 110lb pear and xs was perfect - i also ordered the small to be sure. it is not quite as close to the body as the picture. the color is gorgeous and saturated. it hits me mid thigh in a good way. the fabric is crepe on the outside and silky on the inside and it has a beautiful, high quality drapey-ness. it is unlined but not see through. it arrived wrinkled and sad, but a warm dry iron really brought out how gorgeous
other I ordered both colors in different sizes (xs and xxs) - petite were no longer available, so can't compare there.color: i liked the black better for these reasons:1) color can be worn year-round, just add a nice jacket or cardigan, and ok for winter season.2) ivory was kind of see-throughsize: xxs fit me better, the xs was wider and bigger arm holes.sadly, the xxs was the ivory, so i didn't keep either of them.ref: 11other lbs, 30dd, 26.other in wasit
other This is one of my favorite tops! it is comfortable and an easy "throw and go" top. i am a big fan of denim tops and the lace on the back gives it that extra detail and flare. very pleased :)
other Cute but not sure it's worth the price point. i might reach for it in sale, and while it was cute on, i just don't spend that much on a daytime casual dress. i'm sure you could dress it up with heels or something but there's something about this dress that screams casual daytime. still very pretty and flattering! i loved the neckline and detailing there
other So glad to see high waisted jeans again! very soft, very comfortable, and the raw edge hem makes them just edgy enough!
3 I am torn about this dress. the print is very pretty and the fabric has a gentle flow to it. the top part is great but the portion below the chest reminded me of a tent. it is tricky to pull off if you are well-endowed on the top or wear a padded bra. i liked the look better when i tied it at the back with the ultra-thin belt straps which gave some shape to the waist. i agree with the other reviewer that a slim person could carry the look well. i usually don't return online purchases unless they
other This skirt is so flattering and comfortable!
other This dress has been on retailer's site for a while now (years?) and i finally grabbed one during a recent member sale. i can't believe i waited so long! it's so gorgeous on - classy but still distinctly sexy. i'm 5'10" 160# and the size 8 fits great - definitely fitted through the hips and thighs and roomy enough on top i considered taking it in. beautiful dress overall!
other I love this tank to wear alone because it is soft and more lovely than a basic plain tank. it is especially great to layer with a sweater/ cardigan. the colors are always fabulous and the design is wonderfully feminine. i own several and love them all. it's a great value especially on sale. i normally wear a size 6 and the small fits perfectly.
3 I got my normal size and unfortunately the moment i tried it on the details on both shoulders ripped. the dress fit fine and i basically have no boobs so i don't think it was a case of it being too small. i guess it just wasn't reinforced enough. there was also a miss-stitch in the shoulder on the back which causes the back of the dress to bunch funnily. lastly, there's a slip on the inside which i don't think was necessary. it hugs tight to the body and makes the whole dress feel oddly clingy.
other This jumper is adorable and very well made! it is a bit tight in the ankles and it kind of gives me a hungry bum look but then i realized i ordered a 4p so it is actually tts. going to preview this number at my bachelorette party!
3 Liked the netting around the collar but the whole blouse was very baggy. order size down.
other Really pretty, but runs at least a full size small.
other Skirt fits true to size, i bought a regular size other even though im only other feet because i didnt want it too short. the size was perfect as it hit right above the knee. bold, vibrant color and great quality! also very unique, which is what i look for at ahtro. recommend, give it a shot!
other This is definitely one that looks better on than on the hanger. i am 5'10" so it is a little too short for me to wear with bare legs (it tends to ride up) but it looks great with boots and tights. i love the raw edges of the striped a-line part. i have also worn it belted and that is also a very cute look.
other I love pilcro jeans and usually wear the stet fit. this is the first pair that i've owned that had so much stretch. they stretch and do lose their shape slightly, but bounce back after a wash. my main complaint may be stretch-related: after the first wear, the inner thigh area was covered in pills. granted, my inner thighs touch when i walk, but this has never happened with any other pair of pilcro that i've owned. i still have a pair of black stet that i bought 4yrs ago and they've never shown
other I was nervous about this dress, as when i ordered it there were no reviews yet...and shortly after they, they started coming in and were only negative. yes it runs pretty big (i'm usually a large/1other but could tell from the model it would run big) but it's supposed to be loose. i wouldn't say it's the most flattering - but you can tell it's shapeless from the picture! it's a great casual dress, perfect for hot days when i don't want my clothing touching my skin.
3 This is a pretty dress, although it runs smaller and the colors aren't as vibrant as on the website. the waist ran very small for me in a size 10 which is my normal size and normally runs looser in the waist area as i have an hour glass figure. this probably will look very nice on someone smaller.
other This shirts dresses up anything-tights, jeans or a skirt. love the color and the length
other I loved this skirt. they didn't have my size anymore so i tried on a few others. i really needed a small p. otherwise i totally would have kept it!
3 This dress was cute but the fit was not quite right. the bottom half fit well but the top half was a little loose. it was wearable but i was worried after wearing for a few hours it would stretch out even more and look frumpy. like other reviewers have said, this dress really needs a belt to bring it together. i ended up returning it because i didn't love it.
3 This is a cute blouse. i get lots of compliments. i bought the natural color. super flattering. i bought my normal size in most retailer stuff and had to return for bigger. the chest area is a bit snug. had to send back for a larger size.
other Size down, runs a bit large, sleeves are cute and overall a pretty piece
other Love the luxury feel, so soft. perfect for day out. i'm 5'6 and the fit is just right. not too long or short. dalls right at the shoulders too.
other These pants fit comfortably and are really nice on! they're not too bulky and can be worn in a casual way and/or with a formal look. i just wish black jeans didn't always have that odd rubber smell. other than that, these are great!
other I had bee struggling to find a romper with longer length shorts, it seems like so many of the rompers have short shorts for the bottom half and i wanted something to hit upper mid leg, something like a 4" inseam on a short. on a whim i ordered this and hoped it would be long enough and sure enough it is perfect. still stylish and still "short" for summer without it being so short on the bottom. well made! nice closure at bust so there is no gaping.
other I am 5'3" 130lb and i bought this dress in a petite small which fit perfectly. the dress hugs my figure nicely. unfortunately, i found that the neckline is cut a bit too low to wear to work, at least for my own comfort level, but i just wear a camisole underneath it for work and without for a date. i was really pleased with the purchase of the dress.
other This dress is really really soft and comfortable. it's loose but still flattering. i would definitely recommend it.
other I would have never purchased this jacket based on the photo displayed here. it looks like something my grandma would wear. in person, however, this jacket is so versatile. the fabric moves with your body,and the ties at the bottom in the back and inside at the waist can be cinched to give it the look you want. i purchased this to wear with the weekend widelegs (which i also adore), and it's absolutely perfect. color goes with everything. i'll wear it with boyfriend jeans in the fall, too. great
other I was aware of the split sleeves when i purchased-- hoping to try something new. they're not attractive. the slit stays open with any movement. i don't think it would be appropriate for work . overall the fit is true to size. i otherwise liked the design, but the sleeves made this a quick return ....
other I am not a big fan of lace but this shirt has just enough. it actually looks better than the photo and it looks even better when you wear it. i have received numerous compliments on this shirt everytime i've worn it.
other Perfect fit. though it is shear i found that i could wear it without a cami. i absolutely recommend this shirt. it fits tts.
other I saw this online and loved it instantly. i happened to come by it in the store and tried it on. it was almost perfect. but sadly, being busty makes the dress hang not quite as well as it could. i think this might be a better dress for the less busty/less curvy. but it is super cute and fun!
other Literally the only reason i am giving this other stars is because of my history with this brand (holes developing after minimal wear). i will do my usual wash but don't dry and hope it holds up!material: super soft and comfortable, almost slubby. i haven't seen the yellow in person, the purple/grey is lovely. fit: moderate scoop neck as pictured (almost oval) that's a nice touch as it's not too low or high at the neck. not overly fitted over the chest or stomach - without being oversized - j
other I recently ordered this and am so glad i did. i absolutely love it! my hips and butt are not tiny, so i was very nervous that this would be a giant pouf on my lower half, but it lays perfectly flat and has a very gentle a-line, contrary to other comments. i am 5'4" and 130' but the xs fits perfectly and keeps me looking trim. the waist sits just barely below my natural waist. very happy with this purchase; would buy more if there were additional colors - who doesn't love an elastic-waisted skirt
other This dress was too cute to pass up! i loved it online but when i got it home, it was so tight i couldn't zip up my normal size. the length was perfect on me being 5'7". the fabric and detail was beautiful. if you have a bust, order a size up. beautiful dress just really snug up top.
other This dress is shorter than it looks on the model. i'm 5'8" and it hits about other inch above my knee. it also runs a little big in my opinion.
other Love! love! love! this top! i saw this online and immediately knew tha tthis had to be in my wardrobe. i wear a lot of navy....(in my estimating the classiest color there is...black is passe'). it is simple, very wearable with pants, with skirts. the very thin stripe adds interest, without really being a pattern that conflicts with other patterns. i did have an issue with some threads that were randomly hanging from sleeve cuff...but nothing important. yes, it is cropped...very much so!!! so, if
other This dress is perfect for the summer, very lightweight, has pockets and not to short lounging around. it is loose fitting, so i normally wear a size 10 or m and 5'6" tall, but had to order this dress in a s. the small fits me perfectly.
other Love the idea of this top, but it is so thin and the sequins look so cheap. the quality reminds me of something you would buy for $20 at a market abroad. definitely disappointed with the quality for the price. will be retuning.
other I agree with the other review. the fabric and pattern are adorable and well made. the fabric is not sheer at all and great quality;however, the shirt is very wide. i am a 34/26/36 and the small is way too big. the arm holes are perfect but the bottom is uncomfortably large and awkward in appearance.
3 This is a beautiful fabric and the skirt is so nice. what is wrong is the cut of the skirt. one side bells out more than the other, giving it an off center look from the front. my legs were not centered.
other Love this skirt because of the colors, the unique style, and for a knit skirt i'm very impressed that it maintains shape throughout the day. great skirt to own. received several compliments. had to size up from a other to a 4. 28" waist and 36" hips. the size 2fit snugly and not very appropriate for work, but great for a night out. the size other is still form fitting, flattering and work appropriate. very comfortable going up a size without compromising the form fit.
other I love the idea of this shirt, but the execution is absolutely horrible. i ordered online and what i received is just a mess. the stitching at the bottom has big globs of black thread. not just a few hanging off, but literally big clumps. a large portion of the stitching on the whole shirt looks like it should be on the underside of the shirt as the where the thread is tied off is on the outside!! the fit is just as big a mess. i always have to buy a large in fitted shirts because i have very br
other This sweater is really fun and even cuter in person.
other This shirt was great for one wear. after just one wash (followed instructions to dry clean) it lost all shape and now hangs like a bed sheet. terrible waste of money on a pricey top.
other Like another reviewer, i really wanted to love this dress. everything about this screamed perfection: the length, the cut, the stripes, but the fit was really off for me. i'm 5"10" and am usually between a size 8 and 10. i tried the 8 and the body fit well but the chest and straps were entirely too large (i'm a 34d). so i tried the size 6 and chest and straps fit but the body pulled at the buttons. normally, i'm all for tailoring to fit, but chest would have needed to be reconstructed which isn'
other I bought these about a month ago and i love them! great fit, not too tight for legging jeans, which means i can dress up with a tunic and boots for work. so stretchy and comfortable, but still made out of a jean-type material. love the color - it's a bit of a gray black, so looks great with everything!
other I thought the sweater was pricey until i saw it on me. this sweater is really flattering! i chose the grey colored one. i'm smaller on top and this sweater is perfect with the v neck cut out the fabric is also really soft.
other Super cute! got a marilyn vibe that i like. although i can tie the halter to make the chest area tighter, i will have to get a tailor to adjust the chest area and under the arms a bit.
other I just purchased this cute dress on sale and made sure to size down one size so instead of my regular small, i ordered an extra small which fits me perfectly. i'm a petite yet busty 34d-27-3other and 5'4" and think the dress looks adorable on especially since i'm a huge fan of all things plaid. it's a lighter weight dress so it's perfect for spring or summer but can be worn in fall/winter with this color scheme by adding tights, boots and a sweater or jacket. i also love that it has pockets. i don't
other Flattering dress that looks great on. the back cut out shows some skin while still covering up a bra. the petite size fits true to size
other I really wanted to love this coat. it is well made and unique. i usually buy the petite versions but they were sold out.however i went ahead and purchased a regular size because i wanted a second winter coat.sadly, it looked more like a cocoon coat on me. it stuck out at the back. probably because it was not a petite. it pulled across my chest, like shoulders were too short. for reference, i am other feet, 109lbs, and a 32d.i didn't mind the fluffiness of the top portion and the tie is useful for
other Perfection.  fits like other pilcto jackets and vests.  tapers in slightly at waist for flattering fit   weight is light for summer but substantial and good quality.  silver buttons, not bronze or copper.  slight stretch, super comfy.  no regret!
other This shirt is so soft and lovely, i will be wearing it a lot...after i make one little adjustment. i don't mind some cleavage, but the bottom of the slit in the middle of this shirt goes all the way down to my bra and i feel like i'm showing a lot of side boob...inner side boob?...cleavage? i don't know what the word is, but it definitely feels out of place in a professional setting. however, i'm going to sew a hook and eye onto the top of the slit so i can close it and it will be more like a ke
other Adorable, well-made skirt! lined and very slimming. i had to size up b/c it runs a bit snug around the waist. however, it's worth it b/c this will match many long and short sleeve tops!
3 The top as with most of ap's tops is well stitched. material is very uncomfortable. if you have large bust it is a little divulging. this may prompt you to wear something underneath to look modest and change the shape of the top!
other I think the model photo doesn't do this dress justice. it's comfortable and perfect for a summery day. i wear it to work with a light grey cardigan, and of course it works well causally. i'm busty --d on a small frame -- but there's not gapping. the colors are pretty with blues and pinks without being childish.
other I received this romper last week and have already worn it twice. it is soooo comfortable and the material is really soft. the romper is loose, yet fitted and very cute. i love the open back and the shorts are just the right length. i wish there were other patterns or colors available, too. i would definitely buy again!
other The design/shape of the dress are quite flattering, flirty and feminine. but.... there is no way that the dress i received is new. the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area. there is no tag... the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp, stiff or new. i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received. undoubtedly this one is going back.dear retailer - please make sure that you do not send pre-owend clothing articles to
other This dress is comfortable and a great piece to travel with. goes with ballet flats, sandals, to ankle boots.
3 I fell in love with this dress online. i listened to the reviews and ordered a size up. i got it in the mail and couldn't wait to try it on! i was sad that to find, that while it was tight across the chest and the keyhole in the back seemed to pull, it was really large in the body. in addition, while the lace is beautiful it is very fragile. i still think this is a great dress but definitely for someone who is small chested. for reference i am a 32dd and size 2-other and i ordered a medium.
other This skirt has a beautiful style, cut and pattern. i am so surprised it is on sale - what a great price. it has a medium sweater knit that is not clingy and has a slight flair. looks great with boots!
other This skirt is about an inch longer on me than on the model in photo (i'm other ft, ordered petite) but the length actually works. i have a bit of a tummy, so ordered size other - fits great. really love the colors - so many tops will go with this skirt, so it will be easy to vary the look.
3 I ordered this in hopes of wearing as a tunic with leggings for my rehearsal dinner. it is much shorter than expected and wouldn't have looked right with leggings. it also was more gray than ivory and in the short time i had it on was shedding lint like crazy. beautiful in photos but didn't work for me.
other This top is cute. i got the mint coloured one and like it. with that said, the sewing however is a bit off. the bottom of the top is angled. there is no mention of that in the description so it is safe to say it is not part of the design. it is not tremendously noticeable,  but i noticed it. i will still keep this top, coz i can camouflage that defect with a cardigan.  it is sheer, so if you are wearing it for work without cover, a camisole would be required or a nude bra. i am 5'0", 109lbs, and
3 I ordered the pink in size xl. the color was pretty. the problem is the material was too thin and tight. it ran at least a size smaller than shown in the photos online.
other Great, comfortable tank. cool added detail in the straps. runs big so size down. i wear both a medium and large at retailer and got this in a small.
other Excellent tunic tee. will be great with leggings or jeans, which is just what i was hoping.
3 There were no reviews when i ordered this tunic so nothing to help gauge fit. it is very cute but the fit is strange - very narrow in the shoulders and chest.
other Great winter maxi. soft and comfortable fabric. good quality. stretchy but not too clingy. fitted in all the right places and very flattering. petite was unavailable so will need hemming.
other I love mixed media clothing, and this is no exception. i fell in love with this right away, and after being torn between the two colors, opted for the rose. it's very gorgeous in person - midweight and very soft. however, as soon as i put it on, i noticed the knit sides truly flare out; they don't lay nicely like on the model. it could be because of my large chest (36dddd), but everything below the chest seems to widen me. it might work better on someone with a straighter build or smaller chest.
other Love this skirt length and the detail buttons. also great give to the jean fabric. looks great on and runs true to size.
other I really wanted to like this jump suit.  i rarely have problem with retailer clothing.  i'm 5.6, hourglass shape, usually wear size 2.  this jumpsuit runs small, but that's not the only problem.  top part (shirt piece of the jumpsuit) is too short, so it's digging into my lady part.  the color does not look anything like the picture, so overall this piece is failure.  i hope that i find something similar but fits better.
other I like the design of the dress, but the fabric makes it look cheap. for an expensive dress, i had expected better quality.
other I ordered this piece online and returned it at the store a few days after arrival. the material is very soft and well made. however it is not flattering on the hourglass or pear shaped person. moreover, if you are short, the design may make you look shorter. i am 5'4" and it did to me. the design is beautiful. if you are tall and have narrow hips, this is the piece for you. i am 5'4", 160lbs and usually wear a s/m.
other I understand the style of this dress is "swing", but there is just so much fabric, and it looked a bit like a tent on me. i ordered the s and i just found it to be too loose all over. the fabric is great and the colors are rich and lovely. this style would probably look better on someone smaller-chested, because there is no waist, it falls out from the bustline. cute dress, but i would size down.
other I purchased this in both colors the neutral and grey. i love them both but the grey is by far my fave. this is a nice soft beautiful tee. the burst of flowers are just adorable. i found these ran tts on me. cute little top and such a good deal at sale price.
other I really wanted to like this top but unfortunately it was short and the sleeves were just too puffy. it did not look flattering and will be going back.
other I wanted to like this top so so so so badly. so badly in fact, that after the first size didn't fit, i ordered two other sizes to make sure: xl, l, m. none of them worked i really wanted to like this top. the online photo makes the clothing look so flattering and the shirt is just not....at least on me. the shirt online on the model looks slimming and a lot longer than the actual piece of the clothing. the beaded work is very beautiful, but short causing the very poofy peplum to start at the mos
other This top is awesome! it fits well and has a flattering shape. it's true to size and i love it!
3 I really like the pattern and the cut of these pants. the fabric is nice, too. however, i was disappointed how much they stretched out the first (and only) time i wore them. i am 5'6" and about 150 lbs. i ordered size 10; i am going to try to exchange them for a size 8 since they stretched so much.
other I needed to size down to a small. it's very flowy. but the color palette and the open stitching around the neck and hem are really sophisticated and pretty.
other So cute. modest length. perfect with a flowy top and wedges for date night or t-shirt and flip flops for a little dressier daytime. love the colors
other The colors and fabric on this dress are really pretty. the lace is a soft blue instead of white. i have other dresses like this from this brand and really wanted to keep it, but it runs larger than the others i have. also, it doesn't have pockets. if it fits you properly, i think you will love it!
other This velvet maxi dress is what fall dreams are made of. it fits very true to size and is the perfect length, about to ankles. the material is soft and had so much subtle details in it... gorgeous! once the weather cools a bit it will also pair nicely with tall boots, and an undershirt. i plan on rocking this all fall and winter!
3 After the reviews about sizing, i ordered the size 16 (am normally size large). interestingly, the tag on the blouse says it's a 14. with all that said, the blouse is cute enough and sizing up gave me enough length (in spite of the higher sides) that i'm considering keeping it. although it's a bit big, it flows nicely and isn't oversized in that wide, crazy way. the sleeves are a bit too big but they're cuffed with a button and can be rolled. the fabric is somewhat crinkled in texture. i got the
other Perfect for day at the beach! i'm 5'6 and the length is just right above knee not too short. fresh and cool cotton. comfortable feel.
3 I love the look of this pullover, however, it was too short and heavy for my small frame with narrow shoulders. sleeves were too long as well.
other Adorable and amazing quality. true to size. i ordered a 6 and fit perfect.
other I followed the other reviewers who said these fit true to size. i have to disagree. i normally wear an 8 in shorts, which is what i ordered, and the fit is too tight in the waist and butt. i'm exchanging for 10. i really like the color and fun accents. i really hope i can get these in 10!
other This is super cute. i bought it in the gray and white lace in a size s and it's quite roomy. i probably could have sized down to an xs, but i like the relaxed look. there are a few edges of lace that are not sewn down all the way and i will have to fix them as i can see them start to pull away and eventually unravel but otherwise it's a beautiful and unique top.
other As other reviewers have pointed out, this jacket is way prettier in person than it is in the photos. i can wear it with just about anything. the fabric is soft and lightweight, and drapes really nicely. my only complaint is the photos make the taupe jacket look like it has just a hint of peach/mauve, but in person it's a pretty standard beige. i would have liked that hint of color.
other Perfect fit. did not lose its shape. thicker material. great quality for a great price. definitely  a wardrobe  staple. can be dressed up or down. work (business) appropriate. fits tts. for reference,  i am 5'0", 109lbs, and the 00 petite fits perfect. falls right above ankle like pictured. if they had more colours, i would get them too :)
other I'm 5'other 130 lbs and tried this on a small at my store and then ordered it in a small petite. i like the petite better even though there isn't much of a difference, the petite is about 28 inches long. it still covers the bum but i was hoping to wear it with shorts and i think it's too long for that. i love the beautiful coral color, received a compliment on the color the first time i wore it. the quality is superb. the only downside is i don't like the way it looks when zipped, it doesn't give mu
other Love the pattern and material (not thick) for spring and summer.  like the fit and style. i'm 5'2", 115#. i've purchased regular (not petite) front and side zip (with internal button) charlie trousers earlier this year and last year.  got a size other (i vary between size other and 4) in the front zip trousers and they stretched out and got a little loose after fitting perfectly.  so i got the side zip in size 2.  those were tighter initially and stretched out but are still snug.  with this particular p
other This top is gorgeous and better than the web photo. i love that it goes with the off-the-shoulder trend while allowing for a normal bra - in fact, it even has the little snaps at the shoulders to hold your straps in place (awesome detail). the ruffled portion looks good over or under your arms, length hit at about my hip (5'7" with long torso; 125lbs, 32b) and, and it has an overall flowy but not sacklike fit. i found this to fit tts (bought my usual s). beautiful vivid print looks great with wh
other I also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images. it is very thin as others have said. the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs. structured. it is more similar to a cape or shawl design. if you;'re looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design, this is not it. i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design.
3 I loved this jumpsuit. it fit well on my curvier/athletic frame. i did prefer a belt, which emphasized my shape. unfortunately, it is not lined and a bit sheer. this was a deal breaker for me.
3 I'm tall (5'11" and busty) and found this top to run on the short side. as others have said, the material is soft and stretchy, but the rouching created a bit of a bulky look. i returned it.
3 I have been a big fan of this canadian designer so when i saw the sweater on the web, i immediately ordered it. on the website, it looks very modern and edgy chic. i was heartbroken when i saw it in person. when i opened the bag and put on the sweater, i noticed a lot of little black marks on the bathroom floor. it came from the sweater. size small was swimming on me and the holes on the shoulders, which supposed to look modern...well, the thin cheap material the sweater looks like it's ripped.
other I adore this sweater....  so happy that i was able to get one.  get random compliments from strangers all the time!
other Love the jeans! the color is listed as black for some reason but they are definitely blue like the picture. and what i love most is i've always wanted somewhat distressed jeans but for me the ripped jeans look doesn't work. these are perfectly distressed without being hole-y. i also love the length. i'm usually a 29" person because i love ankle length for boots (tall and short). these are listed i think a bit shorter than that i think but didn't feel cropped. they are also made of some special "
other The design is stunning, the color is universally super-flattering. it's a lovely top. so much so that i tried it on even though it was pricey. but the armholes are huge. you can see it on the model, who is definitely not wearing a bra. on me, there was a lot of side bra exposure. if they'd had smaller sizes at the berkeley store, i would've given them a shot, but my true size was a really poor fit.
other The style and material are nice, but what i love is that it does not give me a wedgie! and i think it would still fold nicely on shorter frames.
other The shirt is exactly as it is pictured, i have the burnt orange color and love it! i received numerous compliments both paired with jeans and tucked into a fun skirt. it fits true to size, as i normally wear a small in all retailer however it is the slightest bit tight in the shoulders. i would give this top a 5/5.
other I need to start by saying i'm 5' 10". i think that's why i love this dress so much. it's not too short on me like so many. it is a classic fit that is flattering on me. the raw edge detail makes it a little more fun then just a strapless denim dress and the pockets are the best! i love dresses with pockets! they don't stick out weird or anything either. the only negative which prevents the perfect other star review is the bottom is fuller than i would like. a-line is a little misleading. it's defini
3 The image online doesn't depict this blouse well.. my complaint is that the sweater portion looks crooked and shrunken where it has been cut at waist level and the ruffles have been attached at the hips. maybe i received a flawed piece, either way, i'll be sending it in for return.
other Love this top! the lace pattern is gorgeous, and the detail at the neck and sleeves make it a little more casual. it's completely sheer, so you do need a white tank or shell underneath. the top is on the shorter side, but definitely not a crop. i'm 34c and 140b and got a small. fits great and pairs well with black pants and heeled booties.
other I ordered the petites hoping the length would fits ankle length but htey do go all the way down. on a muscular bottom/thighs, these a snug, on the model they look loose, but i still do like them. to wear with longer tops... i ordered 25p for 115lbs.
other I read the rave reviews, but tried this on with low expectations. i am curvier on top so i thought the dress would make my chest look huge and show my tummy budges. the dress was the exact opposite - so flattering and a piece i could truly dress up or down. i am 5'6", 135lbs and a small fit perfectly. i rarely purchase anything at full price but plan to circle back to my local retailer to pick this up today.
3 Love this top , although it ran very small in bust and arms , i'm normally a medium will have to return for a large!
other I love this shirt so much that i bought a second one even though they are exactly the same. the cut and the fit are free and easy, so comfortable and how many shirts are all cotton anymore? washes well, hang dry, easy to care for. i recommend this shirt for a casual look with style!
other Ok, this shirt is like my dream.  it's large, comfy but sexy with the back dip.  as a larger chested lady (32g), i really appreciate having a tee that i can easily throw on and look put together.  clearly, this is a larger, styled swing tee but it's one of my favorites.  paired with a cute pair of boots, and easily worn with a jacket.  it can tend to fall off the shoulders so i'd size down.  i'll probably pick up the grey too.
other I love byron lars. very taken with his fabrics and design concepts and i have ordered several of his dresses but i believe i need to surrender to the fact that they do not work for my body type. the dress is gorgeous in person: all the fabrics are great, the dress is fully lined and lots of nice finishing touches. it is a unique and very striking dress; this one i really wanted. however, it is designed for a woman who is proportionally longer, leaner with a larger bust size than i have. i ordere
other I ordered the floral version of this swimsuit - what you can't really tell from the images is the darling, lavender stripe design that is in set opposite the floral. it's truly a darling suit, and very well made. the fit is very flattering, with oddly enough a conservative yet sexy appeal. i ordered a medium after reading the "size up" recommendations from other consumers - but, i've exchanged it for a small. the cup size was over-exaggerated in the medium - and, i had plenty of breathing room i
other This dress is lovely and has a comfy fit. the green color is gorgeous. i felt the sizing was large and sent it back.
other Well, another major score with pilcro!these pants, in general, are my go-to pants--so i had high expectations when i bought them.(i have about every color in the hyphen cut--and always hope they make more pairs)and, what do you know, they've met--even exceeded these expectations!love the fit--true to size--even though i will order another smaller size when i get smaller! these are good enough to have that "big pair" and that "oh, i feel svelte pair!" the denim has just enough stretch a
other Nice basic shirt to wear with jeans. it is super soft and hangs nicely. runs true to size.
other I totally thought this was a dress when i tried it on and bought it in the store. there is a drawstring on the inside to cinch the waist making it look so cute as a dress.
other This is a beautiful dress that glides over your body and swishes around when you walk. i received many compliments when i wore this, with black korkease platform sandals and peruvian opal jewelry. the fit is true to size, i took my usual size l. it is longer on me than the model, and my only complaint is the slip-it is very sheer and you can see your legs through the slip and the dress together, so i had to find a different slip. i think retailer should also make their slips a bit longer, i don't
other I was struggling with the options above-- does it fit true to size or is it too small or too large? it is both too small and too large, which is really strange. the model makes this shirt look stunning, but the product is actually very boxy. i am 5' 3", weigh 11other lbs and i typically order anywhere from a 00p-0r/xxs-xs. i ordered this shirt in an xsp and the shirt sleeves were short and the middle was boxy. quite frankly, it looked like a maternity shirt and the structure was not worth the money
other This dress is adorable. the colors are vibrant and very eye catching. i found it runs tts -- for reference i'm 5'4" 140lbs and i ordered a 6. the dress is fitted on top with some very nice/forgiving pleats around the stomach.
other I loved this top. loved it. the quality and color ( i got the red) are wonderful. the top fit perfectly through the chest and the a-line design was super flattering through the waist. however, i am long waisted and the top was simply too short on me. even when worn with mid-rise trousers, my belly showed when i leaned to the side or reached my arms above my shoulders. i so hoped it would be perfect with skinny jeans or leggings - as shown on the model - but on a long-waisted frame it is simply t
other This piece is almost what i want... i tried on the white version in an xs and it felt a little too large for me, even though it's meant to be a looser fit. the buttercup yellow behind the lace is very pretty - i especially love that part of this tank. it provides a nice contrast and allows the detail to stand out. the navy is also nice (it was on display next to the white and looks better in person than online). what i didn't like was the texture of the spandex on the back portion. it looks like
other This top looks fantastic on. definitly great when you want to look a little more dressed up! the fabric is a bit sheer so i will wear a nude camisole underneath. the design has the perfect amount of shimmer to make it dressy. it is so silky and feels great on! the neckline has the perfect plunge too.
other This was returned in store in an xs. i tried it on and it fit. shorter so it was probably meant to be a mini. i will hold on to it for now. on sale so worth the price. colors are nice and bright
other I loved this top from first sight and finally bought it this week. i am usually a six or a small. the small was so tight on the top that the ruffle rolled up across my chest. i ended up with a medium.
other I really like this sweater. i would suggest ordering a size up. i could had worn my normal size but a size up was much more comfortable. i have a burnt orange skirt that i wear with this and it makes the flowers pop.
3 I wanted to love this dress so much, but unfortunately it ran way too big for my taste. i am usually a 4/6 in retailer, and the small was huge on me. the bottom half of the dress is very much a "swing" dress and is very wide, much wider than it looks in the pictures. i suppose that sizing down (maybe even to a petite), and having the dress altered to be narrower on the bottom half would've made it look like the picture, but that's a lot of extra work for a dress that is already pretty pricey.
3 This was pretty to look at: nice weight, lining, colors. i tried it on and whoa. ridiculously bad. i have broad shoulders and a small waist and this accentuated the broadness of my shoulders and eliminated any hint of shape below that. the model photo looks great, so i imagine this will look great on anyone with slim shoulders and narrow hips. definitely not for me, though...
other This is a great cardigan to wear buttoned or open. the fit is perfect; it is fitted and looks great with jeans, skirts or over a sleeveless dress. love the little detail of lace to show skin. fabric has lycra so it hugs your bodice just enough!! love it.
other I was a little afraid to order this dress online but my local store only had a small left, so i jumped hoping the fabled net would appear, and it did. this might be my favorite retailer dress thus far. i ended up buying a large due to the fear of the front being too short, it was a good call. i'm sure a medium would have fit up top but i have longer legs and i know i wouldn't have felt comfortable in a medium's length. plus i tend to like the oversized look. i paired it with some slouchy socks and
other Gorgeous piece, although much longer than it appears to be in the photo. the price, however, is a bit steep. i'm not sure that i'm going to keep it because i just don't think it looks as expensive as it is.
other This is the best dress. i received it last week and have already worn it three times. perfect fit. casual and so easy but the length and front details make it so fun. thicker than many other "tshirt" dresses... but light enough that i wasn't overly hot on super warm days. def recommend!!!!
other I ordered this dress in the black p8. i am 5' 3-1/2", 140lbs, 34dd. i am average length in the torso area.. when i tried it on i wasn't able to button the button at my chest and the belt came slightly above my natural waist line. the length of the dress hit above mid thigh. way to short for my comfort level. it almost looked like a babydoll dress or a tunic to wear over jeans! the material is good quality and has a nice slip lining underneath. another nice thing is that it has a hook and eye clo
3 The fit is slightly loose, but figure flattering, the fabric is semi sheer and the light, coral color is very pretty. however, after one, short wear i discovered fabric torn from both sides of the back seam. unfortunately, i need to return this blouse asap.
other I love this tee! i bought the teal in store. rich colors. little details are perfect. the loose got was very flattering on me. i'm not busty at all and it hung so well. wore it to brunch and the flight home later!
other This sweater is much more brilliant in person. the photo online doesn't do it justice. a couple of things, the faux fur collar is removable and it is attached with buttons of the same color as the sweater. the color is also more buttery than it appears. it hits right at the hip, which is so nice for wearing with dresses or skinny jeans and boots for a night out. i am 5'3", 108 pounds and the xs hit me at hipline and was roomy without being oversized. it's really fun and festive with the collar,
3 This shirt is really cute and runs large. i am a true s and this shirt came as big as what i would call an l.i get that its a boyfriend t-shirt feel but it was still surprising. if you're an s i suggest xxs and so forth.the color is yellow but not as yellow as the picture shows.
other I would describe the color as more blush. the fabric does not have a sheen as in the model picture. the fit is much cuter on than hanging. i'm a 36c and the extra small is just a bit tight in the bust, otherwise i like the fit everywhere else. i'm going to order a small and see how it fits. at 5' 3" it's also longer on me than on the model but not a deal breaker. looks kind of 1920's vintage on. my fabric is not see through it's more of a twill fabric but not quite as heavy as that.
3 Yes, i bought this dress in anticipation of wearing it right away. it's not mean for everybody. it would look good on a stick figure. if you have some hips, they balloon out.
other This coat is a beauty. the embroidery is much prettier irl and the wool is not itchy at all. best of all is the tailoring, as i am very petite and i am so tired of all the shapeless, sack-like coats/jackets. it fits tts and has pockets. it is perfect, just wish retailer has more offerings like this.
other This is an amazing summer dress! so pretty it stood out even though only a few were left on the rack. it's light, airy and perfect even for the hottest summer days. the straps are not adjustable but for me the dress was not too low and it fit just like on the model pictured. a very thin belt comes with it but adds nothing ,only detracts. i am usually a s or m in retailer sizing and the s was perfect.  ( for ref. 5'7', 140 lbs) this dress is so flawless and beautiful and i feel wonderful wearing
other I love this dress! i would definitely accessorize with a belt. my body type fits best in this style of dress because i don't have a big bust size, if you do i would try it on first. for being shorter, 5'3", i love the length.
other This is more beautiful in person. i love the detail and color. i usually don't like ponchos but this one's shape with the square front definitely sets this apart.
other I really love this top. they show it's as a bathing suit cover up in the pics but i will wear mine as a top over a cami. it's beautiful and looks expensive. (it is). had to exchange my usual size for one smaller.
other I didn't think anything of this top online (i really don't care for how they styled it) but in store it was more interesting. i'm currently anywhere between a 2-4-6 / xs-s-m, depending on the style, 5'3" 120lb 34b. size other regular in this top fit me perfectly. for some reason, on me, the sleeves were elongating and flattering (closer to my elbow) and the overall length hit me perfectly at the hip like on the model, the fabric is lightweight and therefore slightly sheer but, due to the color and p
other I'm keeping this cute and fun dress but i agree that the top is tricky if you have a larger bust or shoulders. i got my tts 6 and am a 32dd with broad shoulders and can wear it but it's snug. the top would probably look better in an 8 but there's so much volume below, i kept the 6. i'm 5'7" and thought it was short but just fine for anything other than a professional setting. i have toddlers, so not the best dress for bending over, but fun for when i'm out and about on my own.big compliments
other Great little spring top. the fabric is soft and the drape is of the fabric is just right. it is very loose without making it look like a maternity top and the length hits me right at the top of the hipbone. for reference i am in my 50's, 5'1" and weigh in the150's. i normally wear medium size and this one was no exception. the blue is a beautiful cobalt color.
other This coat is beautiful! i love the color and the design. it definitely runs a little large. i usually wear a small or a zero and i can wear a small wth a large sweater underneath no problem. i might have wanted an extra small but i just stuck with the small because i needed the coat already. the vest keeps it warm, but the sleeves aren't lined so it's cold unless you have a nice sweater underneath it if you're going to be in cold weather.
other I would have loved this tee but the color didn't love me. it's sort of a mustard orange. the embroidery is beautifully done but i felt the size of the yarn tassels were too big and looked a bit odd, but i have a large bust so don't like to draw attention there. it's a sweatshirt and not a tee shirt, but it flows and doesn't grab anywhere. it looked so nice under a jean jacket. if it weren't for the color and tassels, it would be a keeper for me.
other The rest of the reviewers are right about the color being in accurately pictured. i ordered the dark orange color and i recieved more of a dark cedar brown colored jacket. the print is great, i love it! it's so different than any other jackets ive seen. while the jacket is ã¼ber cute, it is a bit bulky (though the waist tie helps with that) and its not heavy winter appropriate ( it's not waterproof or heavily insulated). for your average winter day though, it will be a fun option! the removable v
other I would suggest trying this on in store. the xs would've worked (that's my normal size), but i ended up preferring the s. it does have low armholes. the s in the yellow was just right for me, but the s in the navy was too low in the armholes and the shirt was cut a little crooked. still, a very cute and classic top that i know i'll get a lot of use out of.
other I bought both colors. the navy is beautiful but the grey is closer to a drab beige and the color really disappointed me, i'll be returning that one. i love love the fit and feel of the sweater. it drapes wonderfully whether open or closed and it's so soft. however, the fabric pilled significantly, big pills not even little ones, where my arms touch my sides after just four wears. !!! i get that rayon is finicky but that is ridiculous. the navy is now out of stock in my size so i guess i'll try t
3 I read the reviews before i bought this dress and had trouble believing that the dress literally fell apart at the seams so i bought it. first the good: i love the color, the fabric, and the design. it's very lightweight and loose-fitting and is perfect for hot days. the neck and sleeves are pretty on. i can wear it as a cover up or put on a necklace and sandals for everyday errands and things.now the bad: it literally falls apart at the seams as you take it out of the package! i"m surprised a
other Adorable! very pleased with the quality of the fabric and the very comfortable fit. i'm sure i'll wear this with jeans, as pictured, but can also see it with a breezy summer skirt.
other This top is absolutely gorgeous!! i ordered in xs and unfortunately could not button it, too tight. for reference i am 5-3", 120 lbs, 34b. i will definately be exchanging it for a size s, i just love how classy and glamorous this top is. i do wish it were a few inches longer, but it still looks so nice. i agree with other reviewer how nice it will go over a cocktail dress. hoping the size s has a better fit on me!
other This dress is really beautiful. i was looking for something to wear to a summer 6 o'clock wedding, and this dress will work perfectly. the fabric is smooth and has a tiny bit of sheen to it which makes it look a little nicer and more formal. however, you can easily dress it down. my only issue was the length. i'm 5'other and this dress was way too long. definitely need to take off about other or 6 inches! i also had to size up. i could have tried the petite, but it fit so well everywhere except length,
other Cute suit over all. cups are lightly padded, which is nice if you're concerned about modesty. it runs really small in my opinion. i am 5'7" and 12other lbs. i almost always wear a size small, but i ordered a medium in this suit, and although it fits and i'm sticking with the medium, i'm wondering if a large might fit even better. it's also too tight on the leg openings, in my opinion. i like that the straps are adjustable. the pattern is flattering, and i like the suit well enough to keep it. but i
other I hardly believe i have not reviewed htis yet... so i tried it on in the sotre and was not convinced, my usual xs looked huge and hte "hip" part flared out in a funny way. i did, however decide to order it online in petties, to see( i really do love the design in the front, and the hemline is fun and unusual). they didn't have my usual xs so odrdered xxs, just to see... what a great choice, it fits like a glove now and the swaeter is jsut so beautiful... jsut wish it wasn't so pricey, but wil ke
other I was so surprised by this jacket! i grabbed it as a last minute thought and then when i tried it on i was in love! i have a pink dress i'm going to wear it over but i also love it over a frilly off white tank or even just over a basic t. i am so excited for cooler weather. be warned its not lined or warm. its more of a shirt than a true jacket but it's perfect for fall in california. i wear a small or m and went with a medium on this one.
other I am 13other and went with a size zero. it was very cute on but a little tight on my hips when sitting. the fabric is beautiful, and very soft and silky. the length was great, comes to just barely above my knees and is long in the back. great work outfit.
other Retailer has incredible service, and so they let me return this dress even after having worn it. however, this dress cannot be cleaned. i saw a stain on it after the first use, so i first tried hand washing it. however, the black part of the dress came off on the white part, making the stain worse. i then tried dry cleaning it (the care tag allows both) and that produced 3 or other new stains where the black rubbed off on the white. it's a beautiful, striking dress (that would be great maternit
other As you can tell from the pictures, it's nothing fancy; i think this dress will get a lot of wear for everyday living. simple and comfy. reviewers said it ran pretty small so i sized up but wished i hadn't. it is not very "fit
other Beware! there is a reason this sweater is on sale. it is not even remotely the same color as pictured. instead of the lovely antique blue in the photo, this sweater is a faded, boring, teal-green. what a huge disappointment.
other This top runs large. i had no problem sizing down one size, and could have gone down two sizes if not for the bust area. i ordered this tee in the distressed black color (in real life, it's more like distressed charcoal gray), and really like the fit. the asymmetric peplum is unusual, and cut at a flattering angle. i also really like that this top is not short; i often have trouble with length at retailer, being long in the torso. even going down a size, the length is great. overall, i like that t
other This was way better than i expected it to be. tts and flattering. the material on the top section is on the thinner side, but is very soft and comfortable. the skirt section is a little on the shorter side for me, but with tights i think i could still make it wearable for work.
3 I thought i would take a chance even though reviews suggested tricky sizing issues. unfortunately it's true, it was very tight at the waist and bust even though i sized up to a size 8. i took it back to the store.
other Cute comfortable top. fits well and will look great with skinny jeans.
other Love these tights. fabric feels great, soft and comfy. took large so they fit perfectly at true waist for 5'6 height. some retailer tights i have bought in large, but they are too short for 5'6" person.the color of this paid is a subtle green. looks great with black skirt and green sweater.
other I should have paid closer attention to the other reviews. i could barely get this blouse over my head! after getting it on, the armholes too are very small. the blouse other than that is pretty and very girlie. i love the pleating and dolman sleeves but i was strangled around my neck. i tried the small but think a medium wouldn't have been much better. it needs a button opening on neck and sleeves. i would have to put this on before makeup or doing my hair. if you have a tiny head and pencil a
other I ordered this dress on a whim because of the 20% off on mother's day weekend and i am so glad i did. this dress is very flattering. i have a hard time finding dresses that are a little loose but don't make me look fat. this dress has just the right cut. i recommend it for anyone who likes something not to tight but also flattering.
other These pants are great. the pattern is beautiful and the fit is perfect. they pair well with a s front tucked shirt or fitted colwyn neck sweater. another great find from retailer!
other Wow this is huge! i'm all for the tent-look with the right style, but this was absurd. i could have fit two of me into the width, and with the peplum style, extra width doesn't flatter anyone. the fabric is also so thin that it doesn't hang nicely, it kind of floats around the body. if you want a wide top, then this is perfect, but if you wanted something that hangs nicely, look elsewhere. i purchased a petite s, my typical size.
other I love this top. the design is very good, i love the pleats at the back, and i tried both colors. i prefer blue even though both look good. the fit is very loose mainly due to the pleats at the back. i usually wear xl but bought this in an l, which was also very loose. i think an m would be too tight across the shoulders but loose lower because of the pleats. i am keeping the blue because i like this style, with fitted pants it would work well.
other Runs big and looked unflattering. i am petite, might work on someone taller.
other This is beautiful. it can serve as a sweater or a coat and i can't wait to start wearing it.
other I bought this top on sale in the store and immediately came home and ordered it in another color online. i love the length even in the xs which isn't always the case. i am 5'9" and a size other and the xs fits me perfect even after washing and drying a couple times. looks cute under sweaters and vests. can wear all year round. lightweight and good neckline.
other This is great. on the model it looks largish, but on me it doesn't. if you're curvier like me (5'10", 155, 32e) it may be more fitted. long arms with great wrists. design is just as shown. not a sturdy piece. but not cheap looking in any way. i plan to hand-wash and not drop coffee down the front so i can wear it for a long time. just what i want to wear on certain days, and more colors would be great. thanks, retailer.
other I think i'll get a lot of wear out of this. you will be able to size down & it will still hide a host of sins. it's very comfortable and stylish.
other Was so excited to order this beautiful shirt!  and the color sky is gorgeous!  but as another reviewer said--it runs small.  it was also way too short.  so sadly i will be returning this.  i gave it other stars because it is beautiful and great quality--it just didn't fit me.
other This is every bit as lovely as shown! the shade of blue is delightful with the pintucks, lace embellishment's and covered buttons. for me, tts. i bought the size other (34-b) my normal size. i can see where it could be a problem for bustier women because the pin tucks tightened the upper chest area and it is fitted in the shoulder area. going up a size may help some but if your smaller like me it is tts. i think it's a wonderful rendition of a denim top. this would work in any season of the year.
other I bought this top as it is perfect for work under a blazer! the patten is pretty and eye catching, i love that it's 100% silk and has the tie in front so it's not too low for work. so chic and sophisticated!
other This is one of those dresses that hides on the rack until you see it. and you think, hmmm- this is really interesting. and then you try it on. and all the ladies in the dressing room say "whoa" yep, this is that dress. much more fitted and flattering on my 5'9" 150lb frame. it oddly kind of alludes to 70's caftans. very cool.
other This top is beautiful. the cutout portion extends below the bust, but is intricate enough to look good with a black bra or exciting with, say, a taupe or grey one. the fit across the shoulders is snug, but the rest of the top is very voluminous. don't expect to tuck this swamp thing in. it's a bit of an odd contrast, but if you're prepared to wear something that is itself a beautiful object, even if it doesn't really make sense for a human body... this is it.
other I am a horse lover so i had to have it as it is of good quality and unique. be mindful that it runs small and fits alittle snug across shoulder also excellent for layering.
3 It's a perfectly cute simple summer dress, but the only reason i'm even considering keeping it is because it was a gift. the material is fine but for this price, i expect something more exciting than what is, really, just a modified t-shirt dress. at least more exciting colors or a print or something. the top piece is other full layers which could get warm in the summer, and the ribbing is tight enough that you have to wear a bra even if you're small-chested (i'm a 32b and super thin and still neede
other The fabric of this looks and feels so cheap it's hard to believe this is anna sui. i would say this is unwearable. there is zero stretch and it is made of itchy textured poly fabric that looks like novelty fabric at best. going back asap.
other I love the unique design and the fit. they are very flattering. they might be a little too thick to wear in the summer but the rest of the year they will work out great.
other Ok. so this coat is amazing! it's high quality, soft, great pattern. the knit lining helps to make this more of a light weight coat than a sweater type coat. it's been warmer this season so i've worn it as a coat and received many compliments. it might not be warm enough for january in new england but i bought a size up so i could wear it over a sweater and still use it as a coat. this was purchased on sale w 25% off sale code, so for me, that was a steal. so happy it went on sale! give it a try
other Very comfortable shirt, light weight top with lovely floral colors. great for spring/summer with white jeans. love everything one september makes!
3 I am a curvy size 8. i loved the colors but found it looked maternity when unbelted and there was too much bunchy fabric at the waist when tied. i tend to like things that emphasize my waist, however.
other It's is an absolutely gorgeous dress, one of a kind . you must have it in your wardrobe . my seamstress needed to adjust it just a tiny bit but it's truly fits to size and is emphasizing the figure.
other I knew i would keep it as soon as i put it on -- comfortable, beautiful fabric, cute gold buttons!  as well, due to the cut, it feels roomy, but has a slender fit around the arms.  the "denim" color has beautiful detail, but i don't think i would like the maroon solid.  i wish there was another nonsolid color -- i would buy another one!
3 I received this dress today for a june wedding. i was so excited about it and the quality is beautiful but unfortunately i am going to have to return it. it runs very big. i normally like to wear items a bit bigger/baggier but with this dress it needs to be tight on the sides. bummer :(
other I got the honey colored and love the color. they are very comfy and soft. i look forward to wearing them all summer
other The lilac pic of this shirt doesn't do it justice......it is so darn cute on! the band around the waist really draws your eye in and makes your waist look really small.... love that!!! also, the pleated sleeves are just so feminine and pretty! the fabric is like a washed cotton.....very soft. i can see this being dressed up or made really casual.....i bought the green color and am going to wear it with a chunky turquoise necklace and pencil skirt!
other I tried these jeans on at the suggestion of the salesperson and couldn't walk out of the store without buying them even at full price of over $200 which i don't usually spend on jeans.. first of all, the material is so buttery soft you can't believe you are wearing jeans, secondly, i could actually find a pair that would fit my smaller waist in comparison to my larger than i wish hips 27-28 waist, 38-39ish hips... 5-other i ended up with size 26... they are very thin and i worry about how they will
other I was so excited to order this dress. i loved that it had a normal neck, nice length, and there wasn't a hole in the back. but this dress is just plain awful. the top fit tight across the bust, it flattened me out like i was wearing a too tight sports bra. then the back zipper puckered and bumped up like there is too much zipper for the fabric. i could not get the zipper to lay flat. the fabric is itchy and very cheap feeling. on top of it all the colors are much brighter than they appear in the
other Gorgeous flowy dress that's great for three seasons. thank you to the previous reviewers for the fit advice. size small was only available and it fits perfectly on me (i'm an m/l on top). i'm short and will have to hem because even with 3" heels i kept stepping on the back skirt. bodice opening is wide and gapes too much so i will wear a cami bra or fashion tape or have an additional fastener sewn in. there are bright little balls of red trim and unexpected pops of violet embroidery, adding to t
3 More importatn, super soft matieral and comfortbale, hwoever, when i put it on, ilfelt like i was wearing a robe... i do like the detial in the fabric, but jsut dind't feel right as cardigan. maybe purchase if you are looking for a light robe.true to size, tried on xs, maybe petite would work too.
3 I wanted to love this dress. i went into retailer in sb to try it on and when i saw it on the rack it looked beautiful, both the print and the material. then i tried it on and it fit like a tent. i am just under 5'other and it hit right below my knees, not like shown in the picture here. on that note, i passed on this one due to the fit. i think this would make a fantastic maternity dress though.
other Love this top!
other Fits true to size and has a great shape. i get compliments each time i wear it, glad i purchased it.
other I love this shirt! it's a nice simple long-sleeved tee with some nice details. i especially love the seaming on the front & back-- very flattering!
other I really wanted to love this dress. the pattern is so much prettier in person. i typically wear a medium, sometimes a large in tops. the medium in this dress was too tight in my chest; the large fit my chest but was ridiculously large in other areas. the front of the dress goes up pretty high (for someone with a large chest) and flows down. there is a tie in the back but it doesn't do much to help with the shape in the front.
3 It does run large as most reviewers noted. i opted for the pxs and it was still very large and the way that the elastic at the top hit me it bunched funny and made my chest look huge and i'm only a b cup. it added a good two cup sizes to my chest and it just looked odd. the length of the petite was good for me at only 5'4" so the length did not overwhelm but the width was still really too wide. love the fabric and the lace at the hemline. it just wasn't for me but for those it works for it is be
3 This fit well, but the top was very see through. this never would have worked for me. i'm glad i was able to try it on in the store and didn't order it online. with different fabric, it would have been great.
3 I really wanted to like this top, but couldn't seem to find the right fit. i tried it on in 3 different sizes and none of them were right - they were either too wide in the hips, or a little narrow in the shoulder. it is cute overall though - and a good way to do a short top, without feeling like you're in a "crop top"
other I liked this shirt so much i ordered a second one online in the same size but different color. unfortunately the second one is much shorter than the first and looks less like a tunic or more like a cropped flowy top - not a good look. so the second one is going back. otherwise the shirt would get other stars. washes well, super soft and comfy, and looks great with all kinds of bottoms...jeans, cords, leggings. wish it came in more colors. i typically wear a m or l in retailer tops and took the l in th
other Bought the dress online and it only has an eye and hook at the top. the waist has no stretch and their isn't a zipper. you have to be a contortionist to get it over your head and shoulders. so cute in the pic but not realistic. going back.
3 Loved this jumper, i usually wear between a small and a medium in retailer (with jumpers it's mainly because of my hips and where the midline sits on my stomach), so thought this one would probably be a medium. but it was definitely baggy/lose. otherwise i would've totally kept it!
3 This tee was meant to be loose and swishy, but as it runs large, sizing down means the sides come up really high, as they curve a good 3-4" higher up. so your waistband is exposed, and it just doesn't look nice:( returned an xs and small.
other This dress is adorable. the ruffles are a very cute detail. the top is a bit transparent. for the price it probably should have included something to make it less transparent, but it is so cute i will just put a cami underneath. runs true to size, my usual xsmall fit perfect (5'4", 34c, 13other lbs). i didn't find the top to be that blousy, i thought it was perfect for me.
other Great dramatic cardigan, wearable art, and not for the meek. i'll wear with a leather skirt and boots, jeans and boots, or a dress and boots. if the lack of closure at top bothers you, attach something --be creative. i like the movement that alternately hides and reveals the statement jewelry worn.
3 I ordered this skirt because the other i tried on in store was huge and the other was way too small. the sizing was an issue so i thought i would try another 4. the skirt that arrived by mail was so wrinkled it was obvious that a day of wear would turn it into a nightmare of unflattering creases and stretched out areas. i like the concept of the design with the button front and a-line "princess" seams in the front and back, but i just feel the fabric in this skirt has too much stretch. i returned it.
other This top is gorgeous in person! i'm in love with it! it's perfect for the holiday season. it runs a little big and long so i suggest going down a size for a more tailored fit.
3 I really wanted to like this dress and was encouraged by the positive reviews. the dress itself was very comfortable but was very unflattering. the top fabric hit my ribs funny and made me look really wide.
other I ordered this dress with great expectations after coveting one in a store, but unfortunately it did not work for me. the fabric is a stretch cotton jacquard which is absolutely beautiful, and the colors are gorgeous. i do not think it runs big, i sized up and it still fit me like a sausage casing. if you are tall and thin with no bulges, this dress is for you.
other I like this so much that i ordered it in both colors. it is soft can be worn both ways, and i like the crisscross detail. very comfortable, not formfitting.   i usually order a medium or a large and in this one sized down to a small.
other Love these pilcro jeans, my usual size fit nice like skinny jeans. i know if i had gone down a size they would look too tight in the legs, they are not supposed to be leggings. they did not stretch out too much all day - slightly in the waist, not enough to size down. the dark color is perfect for winter! they are very comfortable!! love pilcro jeans!
3 This romper was not what i expected when i originally purchased. it is much more casual looking in person, and as soon as i got it out of the bag, one of the buttons fell off. it did look good on and fit well, but i will be returning because it is too casual for the occasion i bought it for.
other Happy to have tried this one on in store. unlike other peplum, the bottom portion does not pop out. looks good under a cadi as well. find this top very versatile. i got both colors since they are both flattering.
other The look, quality, and feel of this jacket is perfect. it does run a large so i would order a size down. i definitely worth every penny.
other In love with this dress! so feminine and lovely. makes you feel beautiful. the fabric, flow, and construction of this dress is stunning and flattering. i am 5ft2in and 11other lbs...bought the xs and it fit perfectly in the waist but is a bit snug in my not so large bust area.  however, the s was too large and did nothing to accentuate my waist and changed the whole look of the dress on me. cannot wait to wear this dress, but it is so long &needs to be altered. itll be worth it!
other In love! just wow. beautiful colors although they're dark you can still see all the variations. the flannel is light and not too heavy. there's visible black lace just below the shoulder. pretty buttons. ordered the large, my normal size and it's a perfect fit. roomy but not oversized. so well made i think this will be a favorite for years.
other I've been looking for colored pants and these are the best!i am typically a 10 or 1other in pants and the 30 fit well. i tried on the rose color and loved those. the fit was great, though they wouldn't be long enough on me if i tried to unroll them (though you can). i liked how they fit my butt, hips and thighs, which is usually the most important part. i find that lots of colored pants accentuate the cellulite on my thighs too much, but that was not at all the case with these.the fabric is
other I tried this on in the ivory color because it was on sale and i thought it "might" be sort of cute. a comfy, flowy, warmer to cooler weather transition top. little did i know how much i would fall in love with it! i tried it on over like 3 things in the fitting room, including a black strapless maxi dress i wore into the store, and it still looked great! it is comfortable, loose, and goes with pretty much anything (i've tried and still haven't found anything it looks bad over). it's not super dr
other This blouse is very cute and will be great for summer casual wear! so cute in this print - it looks great with colored crop pants!it is a bit tough to get the right fit in this top, depending on your preference. i usually wear a size 2-other in tops (26" waist, 34b/c), but went with a 0 in this because it just felt wide otherwise. also, i am fine with it, but this blouse seems to be somewhat short in the torso. if you are particular, possibly buy in store because the pattern of bees varies quite
other This sweater is much more beautiful in person. the quality is very good and the fur is nice too!! i am 5'8 inches and 15other lbs and the medium fit me perfect.
other This dress is gorgeous, flattering, oood quality and, in my opinion, better than the erin fetherston dress because of the black, rather than nude liner, which really brought our the beautiful embroidery. come on, practically everything in rtw is a knockoff of something. i do have to comment that the slip is quite snug, though, but at least it's stretchy. that being said, it still had a bit of a tendency to creep up. i was glad i had a black half slip on as well. the fit is tts but a bit short wa
other This polo shirt has just the perfect amount of feminine detail to make it a great addition to my wardrobe. i love the shorter version, and it looks great with both jeans or skirts.
other I loved wearing this outside on a hot day! the fabric is a nice quality. you can't tell in the photos, but it is a jersey/knit fabric. the color labeled red that looks orange is actually coral. it's a nice color. i usually wear a true size 2, and that's what i ordered, but i found that it is slightly big. i can wear it, but would have preferred half a size to a full size smaller. a versatile dress that you can wear often!
other Great fit, comfortable and stylish. easy to dress up or down, excellent item for any wardrobe.
other Beautiful,lightweight and well tailored more dressy than what it appears in photo
other I finally ordered this after looking at it many times, had to order the 00p as they were out of all other petite sizes, and to my surprise, it totally fits me! why i put larger. both colors are equally nice, but due to my pale skin (and only petite available) i ordered the "yellow" one (brighter colors). cut is flattering, love the pleat detail in the skirt, the 00p fit my 30dd chest, and 26.other inch waist. the length is perfect, above the knee in front and lower in the back. good choice...
other Sized up due to my 36ddd breastfeeding bust and the 1other for perfectly.  i am 5'6 and 165lbs, just fyi.  dress is super flattering on my post 4-baby body.  it's very slimming.  looking forward to wearing to a casual wedding,
other I love this sweater! it does run a little large though. fits beautifully. great for cool summer nights and early fall. dress up or down.
other This tee is cute and unusual and i am sure i will wear it pretty often. i do wish i had ordered a size smaller than my normal large, but i am waiting for it to shrink in the wash a bit. the material is thin and it certainly doesn't feel like it is worth the price tag. i got it on sale and still think it is only worth about 20$.
3 This dress is made of nice thick stretchy fabric. comfortable on, but fairly tight and body hugging. i liked the fabric, but it was the length that got me. i tired on a 6 - i'm 5'6" and this dress was just at that awkward length. made me look short and stunted. not a wow piece.
other Once i saw this trench coat i thought it was so cute! i'm usually a small in retailer tops but can be a little broad so i decided to go with the medium (based on other reviews). when i received the coat, it was a little tight in the shoulders but still doable. i was surprised how thin it was (just a single sheet of cloth) and how full the skirt bottom was (however, there is a cute light blue seem lining inside). overall this trench coat is not really a warm coat, but more of a fun piece to dress u
other I purchased this lovely blouse to go with slim cropped stretchy pants. good for bum coverage while still looking sleek and tailored. i purchased the medium instead of small as this is a true fitted button up style and i wanted to avoid the gaping at bust. the arm holes are fitted nicely as well, no bra exposure. looks very nice on. on point for sure?. (for reference i'm 5'5",34dd, ruler shaped figure,narrow shoulders and usually a small or medium at retailer.)
other I bought this in coral, it is soft and the fit is flattering. the perfect top for transitioning into fall here in the desert.
other I got this shirt other weeks ago and have already worn it other times! i love it and every time i wear it i get compliments on it. it is so flattering with jeans or nice fitted black pants. if you are wavering about getting this shirt.... get it. i promise you will love it.
3 It's ok, fit doesn't wow me because of my body. chest is too wide, hips look too narrow. drapes across my back fat in an especially non-flattering way. basically made my square-apple body look more square-apple. great part about this dress is that it's comfy and hides the tummy pooch. construction is poorly done...contrasting liner at v-neck is rolling out on one side only and then doing the same at the hem contralaterally. another negative point is dry clean only. boo. i'm 5'3" 140# 39-28-3other an
other I ordered this top online. i had been wanting an off-the-shoulder top in a neutral color and when i found this one, i had to have it! i thought the price was great. when i received it, i was impressed with the quality of material. it fit me a little more tightly than some of my other tops, but was very satisfied with how it looked on my body! i got it in a size small. i do agree with others on here, the shoulders were a little more difficult to keep folded down...but overall...i am truly satisfi
3 This is a well made blouse with a pretty neckline. the print with the sleeves makes me look really wide. it's an odd look.
other I love this dress for day and night time. the back detail is cute and works well with a racerback bra. it runs big though. i'm normally a small in dresses and the arm holes are too big in the size small on me. it was also generally too big all over. i like the length and the weight of the fabric. i purchased in the off black color.
other I tried on this jumpsuit in black and it was absolutely beautiful. i liked that it looked sort of like a tuxedo, i wore it one time and received so many compliments. when i washed it, however, it shrunk almost other size! the pant legs were high water. i even tried washing and restretching it because i loved the jumpsuit but it wouldn't budge, i think because rayon is not stretchable material. to my disappointment, i returned it. i really wished it would have worked out.
other So soft and comfy. looks equally good buttoned as open. can be worn as a tunic top over leggings or jeans. the charcoal color is chic and i liked the different patterns on back and front.
other I love that this top is double layered so it prevents any sheerness. the cream colored trim on the white top is really pretty- great combo. has a shabby chic feel. the fit is nice through the shoulders and eases up through the body - not fitted which i like.
other Very pretty and a nice fit. lighter weight than i expected at this price but as long as it holds up i'll be happy.
other I love these pants! super comfy - fit well and a great color. i knew immediately when i put them on that i would love them. and the button fly? to die for. wore them and they did stretch out a bit by the end of the day but they didn't look awful and super baggy. i bought the other color in a size smaller so they might be better. a great pant for summer!
other This dress is gorgeous and feels so soft! looks great with booties and flats! can be paired with so much! jackets, scarfs, long necklaces! so glad i bought it! i did down size to a small from my usual medium! and got the regular instead of petite! fit great
3 I am a true size xl. in my 20s i wore a small and then medium, so i know whereof i am speaking here. i tried this dress on in my local retailer store. this designer, as a handful of retailer designers seem to do, simply enlarges the fabric measurement outward as they add another size. the problem is... a funny thing happens to women's breasts as they gain weight. is this so difficult to understand? as a size small i was an a cup, as a medium i was a b cup. now, years later, as a size 16 i am a d cup
other I ordered the orange motif in short sleeves.and i got what i ordered- and love it. it is a little big, but i wanted a looser top. i was looking for something bright and fun for the spring time that i could wear to work with nice slacks or dress down with jeans. this top meets my needs for sure. i really like the detailing on the top collar-bone area. my husband loved that it was bright and cheerful- so i take this as a win!
other This is a gorgeous lace dress, well made, true to size. a little tight in the neck but not unbearable. lovely for any occasion. i got this to wear to a fancy wedding, it will be my go to dress for fancy occasions.
other I like the warm neutral color of this piece and the figure-skimming shape with waist definition. it is a soft and warm layering piece. sadly, the sleeves were too long for me and have long zippers at the cuffs so rolling them up didn't work. i wish i had caught this piece while they still had my size in petite!
other I would never have noticed this from the product shot, it was on the one of a kind rack at my store. the open work that shows off your bralette or a cami is sexy and it has just the right amount of slouch. super comfy. i loved it. bought a medium.
other Great jeans in a lovely shade of grey. they are longer than shown in the picture, however, which i love. i haven't worn mine yet, and i wonder how stretched out they'll get, but overall the fit is quite flattering.
other I purchased this in white my normal size being a 2, a size other fit better on me. i love the crisp white top with jeans and sandals, so much that i just ordered the same top in the raspberry color. would definitely recommend.
other This garment is beautiful because the fabric has great drape to it. i am probably between a small and xsmall, but ordered the xsmall. it is snug, but i have decided to keep it and can wear a cami underneath, just in case the buttons gap just a little. i am concerned that going up a size with leave the neck area too gaping. it is also a little snug in the elbow area.
other This sweater is comfortable yet still work appropriate. the ruffled shoulders adds a feminine touch.
other I love the ease of wearing and styling this top. i am very pleased with the construction. glad i ordered it!
3 They were ok pants but too small. the texture and shape were not what i expected either.
other I loved this dress the moment i saw it online and debated ordering it as i wasn't sure the color would work on my pale skin, but wow, so pretty! it fits like s glove, in fact i almost had a hard time zipping the side where the fabric changes. the tie waist in a beautiful addition. the chest seems roomy enough, i am a 30 dd and the 0 petite fit. it is surplice so may give more if bigger chested. the skirt is a kind of lace and looks pleated at the same time. my only complaint is the side zipper i
other I happened to see someone purchasing this top in the green at my local retailer store, and the sales associate told me they had just gotten then in and they were already almost gone. they only had one left, in size s. it fit, but was a bit too long for me so they ordered the sp for me. it's perfect! the color says turquoise, but it's actually more of an emerald green. it's a bright saturated color, much more beautiful than the online photo. i have green eyes and love the way it brings them out. it
other This is a great addition! it's comfortable, pretty, and can be dressed up and down. most importantly it's slenderizing and a great length for me! i bought it in my regular size, but bought the petite size, noting the model is 5'10" and where the dress stopped on her. i'm 5'6". the dress fits perfectly and is a great length for me! it also comes with a lovely, blue slip! such great quality for the price!
3 Ordered this vest in both the xs and pxs. i liked the length and overall fit of the xs, however, i ended up returning both due to how the vest draped. the outer fabric is a bit more stiff which made the vest balloon out more then what i liked. overall, it?s not a terrible vest but just not for me.
other I have loved this dress from the first time i saw it. but the price scared me away until a sale came to be that meant i could justify buying it. honestly it's worth it's original price, i'm just too much of a scrooge to pay it! the details are adorable. the length makes it very versatile. it seems well made and pretty weighty. fits nicely due to the elastic in the back; i got an 8.. i weigh 170, 5'8" with a small chest. most of the dresses i buy are just as much art as they are fashion and this
other I got this shirt in red and black. both colors vibrant and material of shirt is nice cotton blend. will get lots of use from both shirts.
other I love this sweater! it's extremely cozy and great for wearing with leggings due to the length. i ordered the red color in a s and it fits great and it is long, like i had hoped. the red is really more of a burnt orange than the red in the photo, but i actually like that even better.
other I have a couple of these tanks so i thought i would try the tshirt and its even more flattering than the tanks (which i also love) great material, doesnt stretch out like you would think it would and looks great with shorts or pants.
3 I ordered this in tan and white, but ended up returning it. the material is a bit thin (but soft). the shape of the top was decent, i didn't think it was too boxy but i didn't like how the seams looked on the sides. ultimately i didn't think it was worth the price.
other This dress is very pretty in person, and perfect for warm and hot weather. the material is comfy and breathable, and the length is perfect. for reference, i usually wear a medium in retailer dresses, and ordered this in a medium as well. at that size, it does not bunch up around the waist as much as it would if i had ordered a large, but then the fit would have been baggier elsewhere on my body. i am fine with it being a closer fit across my waist, so i would say it fits true to size for me, but w
other I really fell in love with this shirt. i am about other other and 110 pounds. i ordered xxs which that was a good size from the chest but this shirt is literally so wide, i was ready to fly. although the model wears this shirt really nicely, i think this shirt is made for a certain type of body. not quite sure what that is.... also this shirt is shorter than what i expected. it looks a lot longer on the model. i had to return this shirt.
other Love this top! it runs very true to size, is not too boxy, and looks great on my 5"1" body (i bought a medium). i purchased the beige top first, then bought this one. great addition to my wardrobe.
other This is a treasure and "must buy", friends! tiny designs the most amazing blouses and shirts, and i feel stoked to have gotten this one. the level of detailed embroidery on the front and tiny silver and gold sequins on silver net lace at the shoulders is artistic and well-designed. i've always found the tiny brand to be predictably one size small, but, when i get past my ego and order one size up to a large, i am sooooo satisfied. this sartorial work of art is completely lovely! i have a busty f
other Love, love, love this skirt. perfect for the holidays but it can also be dressed down. pair it with gold, burgundy, black or a more casual chambray jean shirt. a great price point and i was able to grab it when it was 20% off.
other Love the fabric on this. so many retailer tops sit unworn in my closet because they are sheer and i have to wear a layer underneath. this will not be one of those. the fabric is beautifully embroidered and thick enough that it doesn't feel too delicate. the back is a super soft jersey....feel wonderful! will go nicely with jeans & flats for me! as a super bonus, i bought it with my birthday discount and now have in in time for a downton abby party. :) i'll be so pretty!
other I purchased this in the green color, and in person it does have a little bit of blue in it so it's a very flattering color. the blouse has a simple shape but the details are what makes this an interesting piece. it looks as good under a suit as it does with jeans and a leather jacket. fits tts.
other When i saw this dress online, i immediately passed on it. but i was drawn to it's faint shimmer and soft feel in the store and decided to try it on. i am usually xs - s in dresses and tried the xs (5'4, 34b, 27 waist). it fit beautifully. it comes about a couple of inches above my knee and makes me look slim from the side - which isn't typical of shift dresses. i plan on wearing it with flats now and tights and booties when the weather gets cooler. would be a great holiday or new years eve dress
other Was looking for a layering tunic and this does the job. it's very long and i'm 5'1other and this covers to my mid thigh. the arms are very tight but stretched after a while and the material is thin. i like the button details and the olive color are a nice break from black and white. white might be see-through.
other I rarely even try on denim at retailer because i'm quite curvy and the styles, while cute on the models, rarely have fit me. not so with these jeans! they're my first pair of pilcros and a steal at the sale price! i'm 5'3", 150lbs, 32d for reference and i purchased a regular 28, even though i'm often a 27 in my favorite long and lean jeans. they hug my butt and hips in a very sexy way, but not to the point of not being able to wear them at my office. i will need to get them hemmed, but not
other Absolutely love this dress! so cute with booties and a jean jacket. will be a great staple for spring and fall
other Gorgeous, soft (yak hair, whaa?), versatile sweater. lean fit, not bulky. runs maybe a little large. i'm generally between a s/m in tops, so i ordered both. the s fit really well. the m did too, but a bit bulkier and wide in the hips. i'm 5'8", 140 lbs, 34c. i'll wear this with everything, mostly with leggings or tight jeans with boots.
other I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer. the shirt in our store was featured in all colors.  i chose the burnt orange color to try on and it is was incredibly soft!  i felt like i was wearing a t-shirt with an easy on and easy off feel. the flow of the shirt allows you to wear out or tuck in.  i paired with teal velvet crops and tucked the shirt in for more structure to the outfit. love!!!
other This dress looks beautiful on. it's very flattering and comfortable to wear. it runs true to maeve's dress sizing which for me means in these dresses i always get one size larger than what i normally wear. on my 5'3" height the regular was just above the knee. great for giving you the illusion of the figure you want even if you don't have it naturally !
other I love the overall look and comfort of this piece. my only negative is that since it is not lined, the folds in the material on the inside are somewhat noticeable, especially in the shoulder areas. i guess since it is a light color it is more obvious to me, but it is not something that would make me return it. it is comfortable and looks great on.
other This skirt is gianormous! i usually take an xl or l, so i ordered both. the waistband on the xl was so huge, i didn't even try it on. i feared it would not stay up! so i tried the large, and it was big as well. i think i would have needed a medium. but as it is, it is not the cute a-line that appears in the picture. (i wonder how they even got it to look like that !?!?!) it is huge, hip-y, and bunchy. yuck.
other The fabric is quite thin and sheer. it runs a little small also. that being said they are really beautiful pants especially on sale
other I purchased this in the cream/beige color and love that it will go with everything. i can add details with long necklace or scarf-even a belt but it also stands alone and looks great with leggings or skinny jeans. i would also wear with a neutral skirt as shown on model. the fabric is not too thin and with a bit of cashmere will also add some warmth. it may shed some depending if you wear a nylon cami underneath. i purchased the xs, my usual size and fits great. 5'8-slender. love my purchase!
other 1. i'm 5'5" tall, 14other lbs, and 38-32-40 and the size 30s fit me perfectly.2. i love the hyphen chinos, and these fit almost the same, just a bit trimmer. they are not tight, and just skim my body perfectly.3. i love all the colors. the red is darker than the two hyphen pinks.4. the pants are comfy enough to be really casual and dressy enough to wear to work.
other This is a cute pair of jeans. it has a slight flare and just right amount of fringe. they are super soft and and the color is slightly lighter than in photos. tts, not too low hitting right below belly button and a just the right crop length for my 5'4" height falling ri right above my ankle.
other Sweet leg warmers that are fun and cute too! kept me warm when out in this frosty morning!
other I so wanted this skirt to work, love the design! but, it's way, way too long... i am 5, 5, 116lb, and the small is other inch on the floor. i step on the skirt as i walk.
other Pilcro has become my go to brand for pants as they always seem to fit with consistent sizing.  i'm an 8-10 and size 30 never fails to fit perfectly.  i've got hips and a booty so it's great to have a brand that works with my curves.  these chinos are super soft and feel like pants i've had for years -- broken in but still look polished.  i bought the green (which is really teal) and feel in love with them. i've since bought the gray and sand/khaki color.  i'm 5'6" and the length hits just below
3 This gorgeous &amp;amp;amp; beautiful dress is hampered by a see-through unlined bodice and all viscose/polyester fabrication.  by the way, did you see the price tag?  at least the skirt is lined.  if you have deep pockets and don't mind the slightly rough fabric, go for it.  and wear a nice bra.  size up if you're busty.
other These are nice, comfortable summer pants that travel well. the material has a nice feel to it,lightweight, but not too thin. they are easy to wear with any summer top, and look just dressy enough. i like the elastic waist, but the pants will stretch out a bit, and run a little large.
3 I bought this for an upcoming conference and was grateful that it shipped very promptly.it runs quite large, in my opinion. i'm 5'7" and about 130-135lbs. the small was huge on me in the chest and shoulders/arms. the stomach also wasn't very fitted. the material is thinner than i expected (you can see through the dress to some extent when you hold it up to the light), but i don't think this is a problem, necessarily. had it been thicker, it probably would be too warm. but you might need a slip
other I'm 5'9 and wear a size 12. this dress runs tts though there is no stretch to it, found the bust to be a tad tight (38c). it is light with good movement. i did not find it short waisted and i thought the proportions were correct. the length was just long enough to make me feel comfortable wearing it. i'm looking forward to wearing it to holiday dinners this season.
other This skirt is so soft and warm! looks gorgeous with middi boots or ankle boots. colors are beautiful and the length is perfect to take you into spring!
other I love this jacket. it is stylish, yet has the softness of you favorite lounge wear. the faux fur gives it a touch of holiday fun, and, the fitted cut flatters your shape.
other They're great. i saw them featured in one of the marketing emails. they looked comfortable and cute, different with the leg warmer type bottom. i went to the retailer near me, but they didn't have them in store. this was a slight disappointment because i wanted to try them on for sizing purposes. but, i ordered them because they were affordable, in the $30 range, cute, comfortable, and stylish. they also ended up fitting perfectly as well. nice job!
other This dress is gourgeous, will be able to wear year round.just add a cardigan or blazer.the only fault i find in it is the waist band is a bit wide.however i have a hour glass shape, so my waist is very small
other The print doesn't necessarily works for everybody.
other This piece is just gorgeous. you will almost never catch me paying full price for a clothing item, but today i did! i've been admiring it online, and when i noticed it had sold out (the red version) online, i stopped by a store to see if they had it in stock. well, it looks even more gorgeous in person, and i snapped it up right away. i envision myself wearing this all summer long and beyond.
other I actually bought this dress last year and they made another one in a similar dark floral which i also bought--because i love this dress so much! i wish they would make a different pattern--i'd buy a third one! the online picture does not do any justice to this dress. fits like a dream---soooo flattering. modest but not matronly at all. flows beautifully. i have received tons of compliments every single time i wear this dress. this dress is absolutely lovely. please make this in another pattern!
3 Im 5'1" and about 110lbs. ordered the small because i do have some curves- it was huge- more like a large and didnt have much structure at all. the wool was very soft and stretchy. and like others have said- kinda orange- not true coral color. it fit me like a throw blanket- its going back for sure. might purchase again if the petite xs is back in stock and on sale- this should def be under $100.
other I am giving it five stars because the colors and design are so beautiful. but i am a medium, size 6 around 5' 8, and i chose the m/l, which is just too big. i also found a run in the fabric, which is very loose and knit-like in places. but i don't care, i am exchanging for another one in small.
other I have a curvy figure and have always loved the way pilcro jeans have fit aka plenty of stretch for butt and thighs and small waist. i was really excited to try their skinny,  high waisted version. first, i don't like the faux whiskering on the jeans, i think it makes them look cheap. second, the fabric had more stretch than i'm use to for pilcro denim, and made them feel low quality.  i don't think they are terrible, i just think i should have been more careful about reading the percentages of
other I bought this top on the advice of another tall reviewer and i'm so happy that i did.  this is the perfect top for tall girls.  i did size down from my usual large to a medium. the top was still oversized, but in a very pretty way.  i love the material.  this top is so soft and extremely comfortable. the v neckline is very pretty and not too low.  i can see myself dressing this up with nicer pants for work or with skinny jeans for a more casual look.  if you are a tall girl, this top is a must h
3 I ordered these pants in black and brick. the pattern is great, but the sizing and fit are way off. i usually wear an 8 or a medium in retailer. i ordered these pants in a 10, 12, and 1other petite. the 10 actually fit, but there is no stretch in these fitted pants. they were very uncomfortable to walk or sit in. however, if you're standing up all day and not doing much moving around, these pants are perfect! the print is great in both black and brick. i couldn't decide which one i liked best. wish th
other I love this blazer! it's so comfortable! i just wonder if the company makes more "inserts" in different fabrics/colors? i'd love to be able to change it up a bit.
other This robe is such a pretty design. very flowy- runs slightly large in my opinion but was so cute i decided to keep it!
other I needed to write a review only because i feel like the dress is getting a bad rap by other reviewers. it is a loose, flowy, swing dress. i typically wear structured fit and flare dresses, but i do love a feminine, loose, casual dress from time to time too. this totally fit the bill. it is true to size, fitted on the arms, loose and swingy everywhere else. i got the peach color and love it. the cotton slip underneath is very comfortable too. i ordered the sp and it hits just above my knees in th
other I bought this for a wedding i will attend 10 months from now. when i saw this dress on sale, i just need to get it! it was simply gorgeous!!! it fitted so well. it makes one feel so special. i like the addition of the belt.
3 I want to like and keep. at this price point i cant justify keeping. if it does go to clearance i will reorder. due to the thin material it seems more summery and casual than what i was anticipating. true to size. i ordered a medium and am 5'9 and 15other pounds.
3 Like others, i was drawn to the collar, fabric and overall look to it....________pros:- thicker fabric so it hides lumps and bumps well.- collar is so classy, but i am drawn to anything with a collar.- pockets are a nice touch._______cons:- thicker fabric and polyester = got hot rather quickly in it.- runs a tad small if you have hips. there was only a medium at the store to try on and it fit everywhere but the hips; it just didn't flare out much for me being hourglass. a large
other Super comfortable; great with jeans or leggings. i would definitely order a size down.
other I wear between a l and xl..i chose the xl which was the right choice..if you are a bit curvy in proportions, i could size up. the color is gorgeous...i just logged back on to order another if there were options, but alas, there are not. flattering arm cut! could be worn for work, or with jeans/ out to dinner. it's cute, you won't regret it! (as a side note, it is sheer...which you can see in the photo. needs a cami)
other I am still on the fence with this one. i got it sort of as an impulse buy when i was buying some tops at my local store the other day. the piece is gorgeous and looks great over a black tank top. it is very versatile in that you can wear it so many different ways; as an accent piece over a t-shirt, bathing suit cover up, over a dress. it is a delicate material so i'm sure you have to be careful washing it, but it has a feminine, flowy style that is very unique. the only thing that i'm not sure o
other This suit was high quality, and a cute design. however, it is clearly made for a lean body type.
other Love this dress, i've already worn it many times. i started off with a small but had to go to xs which is smaller than my normal size in order to get the fit as pictured. the length is great and works with tights or boots.great unique dress!
other I love the way this dress fits and flows! it does run big. i normally wear size 6 in retailer dresses. had to downsize to 6p. for reference, i'm 5'10" and 34c. the pink color is other shade darker than shown in the pictures.there was a tear in fabric along the zipper. called for replacing the dress. the sales rep was very pleasant & agreed to send another one!
other Love, love, love this top!!!  love the ruffled tiers at the bottom.  love the longer length. the top does indeed run large.  normally i'm between a medium and small but bought the xs.  love the pockets.  the orange color seems like a nicer fabric, and is versatile with both jeans and leggings.
other Most flattering and perfect dark skinny jean! obsessed is an understatement. i am becoming a big fan of mother denim! just enough stretch to be comfortable all day, sit a little bit higher on my waist, which is wonderful (post babies) and sometimes hard to find in jeans. if you are in between sizes, be sure to size down! these jeans are stretchy to begin with and will stretch out a whole size. i have never been happier with a pair of jeans!
other I'm super into this top! i bought the evergreen color in store as it fit true to size and was very flattering. i went to buy an item that was available online only and decided to also buy this top in black. my favorite aspect about this shirt is that it can be dressed up or down. the material is slightly stretchy though it does not cling. i can wear a chunky necklace and dressy skinny pants and look ready for a nice dinner. on the other hand, this top can be thrown on with a pair of comfy jeans
other Love these chinos, super soft and amazingly comfy.....and quite flattering for wide-leg pants!
other I saw this dress several times and never try it. then i finally put it on. omg, i love it! it does run large. i am usually medium. but the small size is perfect on me i visually like the blue color. but the orange one is cuter on me. the length is great. i am 5'4''. it's right to my lower ankle. so i don't need to wear heel. the quality is very good. it's a great weekend dress.
other I adore this dress. i bought a little over a month ago and have already worn it many times- rare for me. it is so easy to throw on and yet it's stylish and flattering- i don't have the time or energy i used to get dressed up so i love this. when i bought it, it was knotted on one side in the front. that's the only way i wear it now. it just adds something to it and gives it more shape. i've washed it several times (laid flat to dry) and it has held up well. i'm definitely bookmarking this to buy
other I love this dress. i live in maxi dresses versus shorts in the summer and this is the perfect cut, weight and quality. i did have to order it in petite or else i was stepping on the bottom (unless really high heels). i am 5'5", so i would say that it runs long. offer this cut in more colors!!
3 I ordered the neutral and this dress feels and looks great. but my issue is with the fabric. while very comfortable, it fades where its stretched. so around my bust and my back when i moved my arms. i am 5'9", 14other lbs and the small fit me the best but i tried on the medium just to see if it was a fit issue. the fabric still looked weird. i'm disappointed to send it back but i just can't keep it.
3 Beautiful dress; however, the top was small for my chest and the rest ran large.
other I purchased these shorts in a size 24. i'm on the petite side of things and the shorts are a little big. the tie-front allows you to tighten the short. i actually think the photo does a good job showing this item. the color is a washed out gray and the shorts are not too "short." the fabric is light and this will be great for hotter days. i like them.
other Love this dress! can be dressed down or up for dresser occasions. i did order a petite which i usually don't do but due to the length being so long but the petite is just right hitting a couple inches below the knee. i'm 5'4"
other I loved the dress, but just not dressy enough after rethinking what i needed. very easy order and return. thanks!
3 I ordered this online and was disappointed with the fit when it arrived. i ordered the xs and it was still oversize to the point of being unflattering. i am tall 5'9" about 130 pounds and have a fairly thin torso and look best in cloths that have some shape. if you like a loose fit this might be for you. the material is thicker and warm and comfortable. i would suggest ordering down a size.
other First saw the jacket online and liked it so i went to the store to check out. the color looks nicer in person.  it fitted me really well and looked really nice on me. the jacket is very soft and well made.  the only thing is the sleeves are a little longer but not a big deal. can't wait to wear it when the full is here!
other When this appeared on line, i thought t would be a sure thing, color (blue), cut and style, this dress appeared to have been made for me, but i ultimately i ended up returning it for several reasons. fit: i was worried about the length on my 5'5" frame but it was actually long enough. i have narrow shoulders and average arms but i found the shoulders or maybe it was the upper arms to run slightly small in my regular size which caused some strange poofing at the shoulders. not sure if going up a
other This dress is adorable. i wore it one time and got so many compliments!it's very light and comfortable. it fits like a shift should - a bit loose. i love it. wish it came in more colors!
other This sweatshirt is beautiful and a step beyond the ordinary. the white is crisp and the lace is just beautiful. the black striping is subtle and really attractive. i had a problem with the fit. it just grabbed my mid section in an unattractive way. i wear large in more fitted items and that's what i ordered this time. i'm well endowed and it fit nicely over my bust, shoulders and arms so afraid the next size up will be too big. although it didn't work for me i highly recommend this beautiful top
other Cute top and flattering to wear. fits nicely and i'd say true to size. can't wait to wear it.
other This top is absolutely adorable, i cannot express how much i love it. paired with skinny jeans and a bright cardi for the spring, this can easily transition into summer. it's actually cuter irl than in the picture. if you are on the fence about this, get it! you won't regret it.
other I love finding unique retailer pieces that don't require dry cleaning. i was excited to find this shirt, but it's not flattering. the bottom hem is a little tight, which makes the rest of the shirt look bulky. perhaps it would work better on people who have narrow hips. i also didn't like the pink tones when i saw the colors in person. i'll be returning this item.
3 I really like the style of this top, and it's delicate but well made, but i wish it were longer and less boxy. it's nice that it comes with a separate cami to layer, but the cami is very cropped. when i raise my arms you can see a lot of midriff (and the top is see through so a layer underneath is necessary). a longer cami probably wouldn't work because the top is also very short. i'm 5'0'' with an average torso length, and ordered the xxs petite. also, you would have to cut the tag off if you d
other Either this rouching is going to accentuate your waist or it's going to accentuate the fact that you just had a baby and ate too much linguini. unfortunately i have 10 more pounds to go and sadly this dress pointed that out.that said, i had to give it five stars all around because it's good quality, design, etc.. it'll be great but not for me. got a medium and it fit nicely (with the exception of pointing out that i still have baby belly to lose)-- 5'3, 34d, 150 pounds. hope this was hel
other This is a great dress for those days where you just want to throw something on but still look put together. it hangs so well and feels so comfortable yet it has a style that is a combination of bohemian and part sophisticated . the colors are muted but they work so well. i wear it with flat strap sandals and have also paired it with wedges. i receive tons of compliments and have to make sure my daughter doesn't try to borrow it. would highly recommend.
other This dress is the absolute best. it is comfy, flattering, cute - pretty much the best dress ever. as a previous reviewer said, ti is a 3 - even other - season dress. throw it on with boots and a wool cardi in the winter and youre all set. i didnt even think twice about buying it. perfect length- a little longer in the back but not too short in the front (and i do not like short dresses/skirts). dont think about it... just buy.
other This suit is absolutely gorgeous but it really will only fit a very short waisted gal. it fit perfectly in the body and in the bust but just was not long enough for me to lift my arms up and my size c cup boobs to not pop out. i was very sad to return it :( i am a size 8 with c cup boobs and ordered it in a medium
3 This is the perfect peplum. it floats a bit but doesn't stick out and is super flattering. that's why i kept mine even though the front seams were like an inch off, and the peplum pleat is crooked. geeze retailer. this is why i can't justify buying much of anything unless it's on sale. quality in recent years has gone wayyyy downhill.
other This is the most beautiful dress. i am so happy that i got it. it is very comfortable and the colors are brilliant. it's completely appropriate for a holiday party which is what i got it for and i'll be wearing it to a wedding in may also.
other I looked at this on the hanger and almost passed it up. i'm so glad i didn't because it ended up looking so much better on. i wear a s or xs in retailer tops and went with the xs. i'm 5'6" and it still had plenty of room and enough length to cover my backside. i usually gravitate to reds but the red in this top, while pretty, had too much pink in it for me.
other I wear this vest two ways - over a long sleeve shirt when it's warmer and layered over a shirt and cardigan when it's cooler. it's the perfect amount of warmth when i'm running errands and don't want to wear a heavy coat. love it and plan to wear it a lot!
other I love this dress. the fabric is creative...checked lace. the silhouette is figure flattering. work appropriate and can wear it for dinner with a change of shoes and jewelry.
other Very soft and comfortable, great for girls who don't usually like shorts because of bigger/muscular thighs. i would say these run large, but not drastically. for reference, i'm usually a size 6 on the bottom and i got a small. the girl at the checkout counter called them pajama shorts but i think these can definitely be worn out of the house.
other Nice modern print, vibrant colors, and not sheer (no need to add an extra layer which is nice for those of us who run hot!)
other I have been admiring this piece for awhile and finally decided to purchase it, and i am so happy i did! the yellow is the perfect pop of color for fall/winter, but it isn't overwhelming or overpowering. fit is oversized (as is in any poncho style sweater) but it doesn't feel boxy or unflattering. if in between sizes, definitely go down. i like things oversized and i went with the xs/s and it fits great. this will be a go to piece for many years to come!
3 Has anybody washed this shirt a second time? just curious if it continues to shrink.
3 I'm usually a petite, but bought in regular xs. perhaps a petite would have worked better, but this was way too low cut in front and back. i did not like the way it hung on me at all. i'm 5;2" and 10other lbs, but regular xs normally fits better than this did. i could barely keep the shoulders from slipping off. sorry, it's a return for me.
other What a lovely top! the embroidery makes this simple top very special. it's too light-weight for january but will be a staple of my wardrobe come spring.
other This suit is well made, and is so darn cute. i usually wear a 6, but i am a size 8 in this (8 us size, although the main tag is australian size. they send out based on the us size ordered). the only issue i have is that i have a long-ish torso compared to my size, so it's ever so slightly tight in the crotch, but not enough to make me send it back. i have small boobs, so the extra padding is nice. i'm and athletic 5'6" and 130 lbs.
other If you haven't yet joined the jumpsuit bandwagon, now is the time! this jumpsuit is absolutely stunning! classy, elegant and a stand out piece. i purchased at full price. i have a hard time with jumpsuits as i am quite tall and they usually look like an adult onsie on me - this jumpsuit made me feel beautiful, put together and graceful. i cannot recommend it enough! fit is true to size, i am a other and purchased the 4. not too short in the crotch and i am almost 5'10. form fitting but still a bit f
other I stumbled upon this by accident and i thought the turquoise color looks unique so i tried it on, and it was a great fit first time around. i dislike open shoulder blouses because most of them are too open but this one is very sutble which gives it a girl next door sexy look. the material is very soft, the pattern is subtle plaid, and the liner is a plus. size other regular fits me very comfortably (i'm 5'2", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i could size down more but i like the relaxed look like on the mod
other I bought a few of these tops in the long sleeved version during the fall/winter, so i was super excited to see the short sleeved version come out! in this brand, i can wear an xs or s - i typically wear a s in retailer tops. if you need a tee that covers your lady parts when wearing leggings, this is it! it perfectly covers my rump and looks great. it's a nice weight, too. the detailing down the back is a nice touch.
other I almost ordered this online to wear to a party later this week, but i'm glad i waited to try it on at the store (i wasn't sure if i'd like the length of the petite or regular better.) i was so disappointed and didn't end up getting either! i have two bailey 4other dresses from several years ago that are much more flattering and incredibly soft/comfortable. this fabric on this dress was much rougher and it really bothered me that the stripes cut off at the side seams and then don't match up from the
other This sweater is a lovely color and very soft. however, the sweater 'sheds' terribly and the color is very large distracting from the overall appearance. it's also thin and whatever shirt is worn underneath will show through.
other I purchased the floral patterned version and get complimented every time i wear it. i found it to be pretty true to size, even after washing. it's a little sheer, so you'd definitely want to wear a camisole underneath for work. it's a great top for spring/summer!
other Don't get me wrong, this is probably cute on someone else, but not me. i looked in the mirror and just laughed, it was that bad. so if you're considering getting this, size down. ordered mine in large and it looks like i'm wearing a barrel. the pink is pretty but the horizontal striping did nothing for my shape. the fabric is soft. i'm just over trying peplums.
other I loved it but can understand the mixed reviews. i am 5'7" and a size 2-other usually. 32d. you need to be on the tall side for it to work. definitely will not work if you are petite. i can also see if you have a fuller chest how it would tent and look like a maternity top. i have that happen with off the shoulder styles. that said, if it works, it is great. i didn't size down went with s) because the xs didn't hang well. it was too short at the shoulders and neckline. again, probably need to be in
other This dress is incredible. i saw a sales girl wearing it in my local retailer and loved it! i bought it in the navy color, it's gorgeous in person, very bright, vibrant colors. i am 5'9 3other c bra 27 inch waist and the s was quite big on my waist. i kept it anyway because the xs has been sold out, and got it taken in a bit. i wore it while vacationing in mexico and it definitely turned heads, if you're thinking about buying this dress, do it, you won't regret it!
other I love the muted coloring! this top is generously sized. i have a small bust and it is roomy under the arms. i wish it was less full around the waist area.
other Perfect slimming fit. wore it to work and then on to a holiday party. received multiple compliments throughout the day and evening!
other Absolutely adore this dress and plan onwearing it to a wedding. it is so well made and luxurious, i feel amazing in it! even more gorgeous in person
other This top is absolutely adorable, fits small on top and then flares out a bit as shown. i bought it months ago and haven't worn it yet though. might try it with white jeans as shown.
other What a great top! i am 5'9" - 136 lbs with a 34d chest.. and this top looks and feels great on. i am usually a 6 and the small fit perfectly. i purchased the grey and it is a nice medium grey color. the v in front hits in a great spot.. not too low, but just low enough to look feminine. i haven't washed and dried the top yet, so i hope it looks as good after washing as it does brand new. i was hesitant to order because of the earlier reviews, but i find this top really works for me, so i am glad
other Love this top!  it is fitted through the shoulders and arms and has a slight swing.  the peplum falls at a great spot and the material lays nicely.  very flattering on my other months postpartum body that is on the rebound.  i got the blue but i might get the pink too!
other I love these pants and have two colors from last season. they are well-made and versatile. however, given the amount they stretch and the summer season for sandals, 30.other is a tad long for petite. i'll have them hemmed an inch to keep them from dragging on the floor. also, i wish the coral and green came in petite.
other From unique shape to feminine design, this cropped summer sweater is the kind of item that attracted me to retailer thirteen years ago.  it's also flattering, especially for this petite, who doesn't like to show her upper arms.
other As stated by others, this is the type of unique retailer product that i love and that makes me return to the store again and again. i would have given it other stars if the sleeves were lined and the body length was longer. the sleeves are indeed long, although this adds to the coziness. but i would have loved the body a bit longer like other cardigans have been. i'm looking forward to wearing it as soon as we get a bit more cool here. congratulations, retailer, for a winner!
other I wanted to love these, they are cute and warm - but they have absolutely no elasticity. i'm so mad at myself for not reading the reviews because i ended up wasting money on shipping other pairs of leggings that i ultimately took right back to the store.
other I ordered these as i was curious of hte fit on my body type (shorter, thighs)... well, it was ok, but in the end, i dind't keep them as i would be better off wearing jeans on casual day, or "real" joggers (as in jogging material).cut was ok, not super flattering, but tapered pants only suit stright legs in my opinion.material was nice enough, din'dt notice wrikling, but i didn't wwear them, jsut tried them on.grey color was nice.
other This dress is really beautiful. i have already worn it to both an engagement party (fancy) and just out to dinner (casual); it fits most occasions, depending on what you pair it with, which always makes me feel like i have gotten my full money's worth. i've gotten several compliments on it; the best one being that it looks as though i was wearing a piece of art! the outside material of the dress is silky in texture and has a nice sheen to it. it looks true to the picture on the website. the dres
other I'm a 0/other on top with 32d's and i purchased this top in a medium and it fit perfectly. pretty colors go with a mix of bottoms. design is both functional and attractive, which usually isn't the case with swimwear. love the underwire cups, adjustable ties and straps. and the fabric is really soft and comfortable.
other I love this sweater. the pale pink color is gorgeous. i ordered a large because i have broad shoulders, and it fits perfectly. it's a great sweater for any season. love the slits on the sides and the longer back. i would order more if it came in white or black. love it!
other Love this product; got them in the coral and they are comfortable, easy, flattering & versatile.dressed up or down, they always look good, they hang beautifully, and their ease & comfort make them my go to staple in this southern heat!
3 So this is still a pretty cute shirt, but my xs is missing the ruffle in the front and has layers on the bottom front of shirt. it doesn't seem to be defective, just a different version of the shirt. i'm curious to find out from others if they have gotten the same shirt as i have. still deciding whether to keep or not. no more left in xs to place another order and see what's up. i do wish it had the ruffle in front, as that is what caught my eye.
other Great color, soft fabric, but waaaaay too long. more like a night shirt than a t-shirt.
other I am 5'6", 130 lbs with an athletic body type and i ordered a size small. these were really baggy in the thigh/quadricep area and made my thighs look bulky. the fabric quality is very nice and i like the idea of them for curvier body types. my son commented that they looked like pajama pants and i agreed.
other What an adorable, classic style fringed top this is! i recently purchased this in my regular size but i should've read the reviews first and ordered a size up. when i went up from a size 6 to an 8 (34d-27-35), it fit me perfectly and looks so cute on! i think this one feels well made and i love the little details of the beads and how the fringe is placed. it looks very flapper girl;) i bought this on sale in the pink color and cannot wait until spring and summer to wear with jeans or a skirt!
other 1. i'm 5'5" tall, 143 lbs and 38 (36d) - 3other -40 and the medium fit me well.2. my only problem is that the collar keeps falling to the back. i feel like the shoulder isn't cut right to sit on the shoulder. i seem to have this problem a lot with this brand, where the shirt just wants to fall to the back.
3 I am 6' and typically wear a size 8-10. i am a rather busty kind of gal (36h), so i usually order larges in tops so that i am sure there is no pull across my chest. i ordered a large in this top in the plum color. when i received the top, i could not stop laughing at how huge it was... the fit in the chest area is fine, but i can wrap the sides around me and tie them into a bow. at least half of the material needs to be removed! despite how huge the top is, it is very cute otherwise! i just mail
other What a great, easy to wear jumpsuit! i love that the sleeves are a relaxed fit...sometimes they make these jumpsuits so unforgiving who wants to wrangle your way in and out? anyway i totally agree with the other reviewers that this is very stylish, comfortable and it looks amazing on.
other I've gotten many compliments with this delightful dress. colors ar light and just right for a summer day. so comfortable and has a nice inner lining. very light and comfortable.
other Can't wait to wear this during the holidays. beautiful embroidery and detailing.
other It is easily paired with a nice tip for work and feels great to wear all day
3 I loved the pattern, color and mock turtleneck style of this top, but it was just too short on me. i purchased the xs in the ivory color (i am 5'5", 32d, 110 lbs for reference). i had planned to layer this under jackets for work, but every time i raised my arms, you could see my stomach. i would not have felt comfortable wearing it to work because of this. the fit was slightly boxy also, and it was not flattering when i tucked it into a skirt because the boxy shape caused the shirt to bunch up s
other I love this. it is perfect. it is sheer, but i wear a black cami underneath and it looks great. so glad antro finally has something with a waist! the small metal buttons are a really nice added detail. i wish you would make more tops with a defined waist like this one!
other I have a countless number of maeve dresses, all size 6. bought an 8 after reading reviews and glad i did. fits perfectly for me one size up. only other issue is the cutout in the back. my bra shows unless i'm very careful.
other True to size and lovely dress, except the arm pit area is tight and pinches. had to return.
other It has been a long cold winter and spring...but it is going to get hot!and this is a perfect dress for july.i tried this on and did not feel the need for a slip or a cami, yes, it is lightweight, no, i would not consider it for work, but when it gets hot in the summer, i feel like this will be a perfect slip on and go dress for days or casual evenings.i wear a 12, and the medium fit perfectlyi considered ordering the small, since i had some extra space, but again, it is going to get hot,
other Absolutely perfect for summer. great weight, lovely soft lining. love pockets in any robe. sleeve length is perfect. actually flattering, if you consider robes such a thing. i love it!
other 5'7", 135lbs, 34c, 27-28 waist. typically wear between a other or other in maeve. bought an 8 in this. blouse is incredibly sweet - the white is beautiful but i opted for the black bc it seemed more internship appropriate. the front and back are completely different lengths - not a traditional high-low. the fabric has little to no give and the back has buttons running down. size up other or other sizes to avoid popping buttons! gorgeous with jeans or pair with some fun cigarette trousers (cartonnier, for exampl
other This sweater looks way better in person than in this picture. the secret: try the petite size. loses a star for not having seamed edges , so it might fray or unravel easily-- but of course that clean unseamed cut looks super cute, especially around the neck. also a bit spendy. but let me say again: super cute on.
3 It broke my heart to have to return this dress -- the fabric is simply gorgeous, very high quality, and i love the contrast between the yoke and the rest of the dress. but it was simply not flattering on me. i am 5-other with a relatively large bust and an overall medium build. the small size fit me perfectly, but the cut just didn't look good on me. i have other tunic dresses that look great on me with tights and boots. so i am not entirely sure why this dress just didn't work for me. it may be tha
other This is such a pretty dress. it will look beautiful in the summer with a tan and lace up sandals for a very effortless look. fits very fitted in the top and loose throughout yet still slimming. i am petite 5'other about 10other pounds and for reference i went with the xxsp. it looks expensive and well made and the yellow color is stunning and cheery. the yellow will look beautiful on darker skin tones as well as lighter skin tones who have a warm undertone. if you are on the fence order it and you won't
other This coat is wonderful! i am usually an xs-s in retailer and i got the xs. it is supposed to be a bit large. goes with everything and great quality.
other I fell in love with this shirt the moment i saw it!unfortunately, when i went to put it on, there was a hole running down the seam in the back. i went to store to exchange, wore the shirt, and someone tells me i have two holes in the back of my shirt. horrified, i went home, took a look, both holes along the seam! i will be returning this, i really liked this shirt!
3 I absolutely love the fit of these jeans! they are perfect in length and fit nicely on the hips. they are fitted and look nice with boots, but they do not feel tight at all because of the legging material. legging material, while comfortable, typically feels thin, but these do not and they are quite warm.the one major drawback is that the pants have pilled on the thighs. i have had these pants for about 1.other months now and i have washed them (and have hang dried them) about other times. i have neve
other Beautiful! caught my eye online. i had to order then reorder in a smaller size, but it is wonderful. colors are beautiful.
3 I love this top. it is very short and hits at a potentially unflattering area if one has wider hips. the fabric and swing to the "skirt" is adorable.
other I have loved the pilcrow hyphen chinos, and have purchased many pairs. however, the last 3 pairs i've ordered are all a different cut now. they are no longer the chino i loved, although they have the exact same name. they are now "boy cut", and are much more narrow through the hips and thighs. nowhere on the description does it say "boy cut". it's not until the package arrives in the mail that i'm saddened to find this changed product with the same number. it really should say this int he descri
other Lovely dress. i did send it back only because the length was below my knee and i prefer slightly above the knee.
other I'm glad that i went with the other reviewers and sized down on this one. i bought this in a medium (usually wear a 10/12) and it fit perfectly. the colors and pattern are beautiful and will definitely look great with dark jeans/pants/shorts. the lace detail is just gorgeous! the bottom flows more loosely, but just enough to cover any midsection flaws and pairs nicely with dark skinny jeans.
other Bought this dress online in my usual 0p for a special event and liked the cut but found the area around my stomach and the bottom of the open area on the back to be a bit large. this in the back created the potential problem of flapping open so that you could see down the back of the dress. surprisingly they had 00p as well so i reordered that one and love it. keep in mind that the style is very subdued and elegant especially from the front with a little bit of fun added to the back with the
other These do run small for pilcro which i think runs large overall. after reading other reviews i decided to get the size i would order in ag or coh and the like. thanks fellow reviewers because i'm pleased. when i first put them on i said no. the waist was a tad big (but comfy# and the legs seemed tight. with the slits at the bottom going right to my ankle (29 inch inseam) i thought these looked ridiculous. however, once i had them on for about 10 minutes they just sort of molded to my body and loo
other Even on my 5'1", short-waisted, 100 lb body, this was super short. it was also super boxy. not flattering at all. the blue was a good color but this is going back.
other I absolutely love this tank. it goes great with a pair of jeans and cute booties. great colors and material. i love the nigh neck.
3 I've been eyeing this top up in the floral pattern for a while and finally ordered it when i had 15% off. i really don't think it's worth the price and it's not very flattering. i think it would look better on someone less busty - it seemed to accent my bust. it's definitely not my favorite piece and unfortunately i will be returning.
other These are comfy and cool. i got the blue, which is more royal than navy. in opinion, it goes well with almost anything! i can wear all the neutral colors, in addition to orange, red, yellow and patterns. they are flattering and like other reviewers, i went up a size to 28 in the blue. perfect length, not too short. got the same version last year in white, 27. 5'4", 128lbs
other I love this skirt!! it slips seamlessly from day to night, and looks great on those of us who happen to be on the taller side. it's super warm, so it's perfect with tights and boots on those colder winter evenings out.
3 I have more of an athletic figure, and the sleeves tend to come in closer to the body than pictured. i didn't like that cut on my arms/torso. the shirt is really cute, otherwise! i am usually a size 4/small and this was a little short and snug.
other You know how sometimes you put something on and don't even have to look in the mirror to know you like it? well this is that piece of clothing. i bought a jumpsuit last year at retailer and wore it all the time so i wanted to get a new one this year. i saw this on the website and liked it all the way through when i put it on at the store. comfy, casual, not too young for my 56-year-old self, the right length, and i can comfortably wear a regular bra with it. perfect on all counts.
other What a fun print to have on a dress, let alone a sweet off white lace confection like this one. i really love the design and all the nice high quality touches. because i am busty and there is no stretch, i sized up. my only wish was that the look of the skirt wasn't so innocent..the flounce looks a bit juvenile, especially at my age. i'll try to figure out how to flatten it , maybe wet the skirts like a regency lady ;) here are my stats since i purchased 12p: 5'3" 145# 36dd.
other I love this top. it looks exactly as pictured and has a very flattering fit. i ordered the black and it is somewhat sheer. the material has a slight burnout effect. the black can be worn without a cami but if i wear it to work, i will need to add one.
other After reading the glowing reviews i was excited to buy this on sale. i'm tall and lean, but found the dress looked slightly awkward and off on me compared to the model pictures. firstly, the top has a strange transition to the skirt, with extra fabric you have to either blouse over the skirt or bunch together. if you blouse it and lay flat, it invariably gets bunched as you wear it. this bunching changes the aesthetics of the color blocks, creating less clean lines. i also found the blue, black
other Great color and shape for all seasons. i was so elated to get this piece on sale! love it!
other I loved this but hesitated to order since i'm petite and busty and assumed it would be an awful mess in the chest area (too tight, gaping etc) but it is great!!! it fits perfectly! there is plenty of room in the chest and the dress is not too long! i ordered a pm and its wonderful. the dress is not see through at all. love it!!!!!
other I love these jeans. the fit is much better than the white pilcro hyphen slit jean which is cuts lower. nice weight. not to heavy and not too light in weight. these look terrific with the vanja peasant top in the yellow print. a darling outfit. the lace give them flair and dress them up so i can wear them to work. highly recommend!!
other The first time i saw this in the store i passed it by because the fabric didn't appeal to me .... but the second time i tried it on and fell in love .... had to have it in the beautiful blue.  i'm busty 32h but wear a small and the gathers do wonders to camouflage, which was a nice surprise, because i usually avoid anything with fullness.  will look great with white or black jeans but i will also pair with a very subtle pattern legging as the length is perfect.  i'm short, 5'3".  neckline is fem
other I love this! great quality and flattering. i'd definitely agree that it runs true to size, as i had to size up because it was the only size available, and it is a little large in the stomach and rear, but it works well in the chest area. the v neck isn't too low and the sides provide good coverage up top. also, it covers the rear end well! material is nice and thick and the seams are good quality. super happy with this purchase, just wish it was in stock in the smaller size so it held me in more
other I get a ton of compliments on this. cute and comfortable. you can't go wrong.
3 The skirt in person is not like the picture. baggy and runs large. i wear jean size 2other and the xs is two size too loose. there's no pocket which is surprising on a denim. the slit in front makes the skirt  look even loose , no shape near what's in the picture. and there's no petite sizes. i am going to return it.
3 The navy blue lines on my dress on the very top of the interior layer can be seen through the upper layer at the very top and it looks cheap. for this price, i would expect more thoughtful patterning. the fit is amazing, so i am debating whether i should keep or return.
other I agree with almost everything the previous reviewer said with one notable exception: probably because she and i have very different figures, i am able to wear the sweater fully snapped with the belt cinching my waist creating a peplum effect. i wore this jacket to a party as a top over a black band aid skirt (code for tight-fitting and tastefully short) with black semi-opaque tights and black booties. the look was classy, but edgy having paired a delicate floral pattern and unusually feminine n
other The top is adorable and i love it. however the pink is not pink but more of a very faded orange color. i was really hoping for pink but the shirt is a keeper.
other I just bought this dress today, and it is absolutely stunning. it looks so much better in person than on the model. i think it runs true to size, however it does have relaxed fit. overall, the dress has nice quality fabric and nice flow, without adding bulk. great buy!
other A beautiful sweater and very flattering on.  the stock photos do not do it justice.  but, i had to give it only other stars because it was so itchy that i couldn't even keep it on in the dressing room for more than a minute.
other This is a fun and classic dress. the dress is well made, as others said, it doesn't have much "give".  i am a 36c, 29", 39"- and the size 8 fit perfectly. i didn't experience any gapping between the buttons. it is a nice fun summer time dress! it is also very flattering!
other This sweater is super cute with the mock neck. i love all 3 colors. i typically wear either an xs or s in retailer sweaters, and purchased a s in this one. now that i've put it on again at home, i'm wondering if i should have sized up to a m mainly due to the sleeves and hem of the sweater being short. i'm 5'6" (and 126 lbs), so not overly tall and don't typically have this issue. i feel like the model (who is likely taller than me) has to have on at least a size l and have the sweater pinned back
other This dress fits and flatters a curvy silhouette. size medium length is perfect for my 5'7" frame. utterly comfortable and so many compliments!
other Besides being my favorite color to wear, this dress oozes vintage glamour while not looking like a costume. the fabric is super silky and will need a professional steaming to get out any wrinkles. the fit is not what i'm used to, because it fits in a 1940s type of way, and when i took it to my tailor, she ensured me that it is the perfect fit. the bodice is a bit looser than contemporary pieces, but is perfect for a night out.
3 I tried this dress at the store and it made me look 10 years older. the fit was tts but a bit odd around the waist. i am 5'4" and 160 lbs and tried a small.
3 When i first saw this shirt online i was so excited! it reminded me of why i love shopping in the fall! unfortunately when it came i was so disappointed. in person the fabric and the colors are gorgeous. it's fairly lightweight for a flannel but so soft and comfy cozy. i love the navy/cream polka dot that is on the inside of the cuffs and collar as well, and the buttons are cute too! when i put it on it was so comfortable, but it made me look like i was pregnant! especially from the side it just
3 This top runs large. i am going to return the medium i ordered for a small. i wish it came in different colors. i love the style.
other I ordered both colors in the xxs p knowing that size goes fast. i used to wear xs or xs petite consistently, but this last year, i have found myself needing the smaller size (vanity sizing?) in this case, the xxs p was perfect for me, length was around mid-thigh (could almost wear as a dress if i were younger and not as muscular in my thighs), the waist and chest are fitted but not snug (fitted in the sense that it follows my natural curves). the flower patterns are so cute, it does cut at the p
other Love love love. i tried it on a whim when returning a shipped item. it's gorgeous and incredibly flattering. runs large (it's drapey and would likely look good in your normal size since you can synch the waist, but probably best to size down as it seemed large in the bust size - which isn't an issue i usually run into). it's quickly become a great staple for work. definitely pair it with bodycon pants/ leggings/ skinny jeans - and it looks unique and very professional.
other This is an intriguing looking skirt, with it's sharp diagonal and the "quilted" optic pattern front panel. it's a nice twist on a black pencil skirt. i've been wearing it with a longer, wrap sweater in the cold, but imagine that i'll be able to wear it into the spring and maybe even year round with lighter weight tops. the fabric is a little thin in the back and the diagonal doesn't lie as straight or look as sharp as i'd like but for the sale price i paid, i really shouldn't complain. it's also
other I didn't realize that the grey sleeves are attached (i assumed that was just an undershirt on the model). needless to say it looks cheap and poorly made. will be returning
other Dress is actually very cute - i like it better in person than online. the color is a very pretty deep denim blue color. it is cut very roomy/swingy. length is a bit too long in the back for my taste but still like the way it flows. i am very slight of frame and on me there is a lot of extra material but nothing a good tailor can't fix in a jiffy. perfect for a summer day/bbq or casual party.
other These may be my new go-to pair of jeans. they have just enough stretch and softness that i can be comfortable in these all day. however, i noticed after the 2nd time i wore them, there were pills in the inner thigh area.
other Great design, beautiful colors, well fitted. got compliments.
other This top is really great for the summer. the fabric is light and gauzy so it's perfect for hot days. i don't like to wear a cami in the summer and this shirt does not require one when worn with a nude bra. i love the window pane pattern- and the light pink color is very flattering and subtle. i'm 5'5", 12other lb. with fairly broad shoulders, and wear either a small or medium. i ordered the medium in this shirt and found it a bit large so the small would have worked as well. i would say that your re
other It hangs very nicely on the model in the picture but when i put it on it fit tight in the sleeves and upper back but huge in the front. the sweater was also sparkly which made it look cheap. i loved the lace detail in the back but the sweater was returned. did not fit well and was not good quality. very thin
other Absolutely love this jacket - soft, nice amount of stretch, and the fit is beautiful. i'm 5'7" with a long torso and was happy with the length on this too (motos are sometimes tricky for me). totally cute and versatile - worth full price!
other I love this dress. the quality of the material is very nice - good weight and softness. the dress hides my baby belly and feels really comfortable on. i got tons of compliments when i wore it!
other I haven?t loved the look of something so much in a while as this skirt in the green motif, which i spotted in my durham store. so i ordered it in the xspetite; my usual retailer size (+/- 10other lbs., 34" hips, 26" waist, average torso length, short legs). if you have smaller than a 26-inch waist, the waist of the xsp will probably be too big. i?d say this skirt is exactly as pictured. the fabric is a thickish, textured knit on the outside, with a thin, green, very soft jersey lining. you have to be
3 Got this in the moss color. i throw on a hoodie almost every day to walk my dog so i justified the high price. returned it because it was not cute on. the waffle fabric didn't stand out, and the bottom just hung straight. i thought it would be more ruffle-like. even on sale i won't buy it ~ it's just that blah
other Love this tank, i am petite and this was the perfect length for me, i wore it with white jeans and a blazer.  love the print!
other I'm not usually a fan of tees as i'm a little but busty, and don't like material that clings. the color of this tee is gorgeous, though. the neckline is feminine, and it has it enough weight that it moves.not sure how it'll wash, but will try to keep it out of the dryer.
other I loved this dress so much i got it in other colors. i had to send it back twice to get the size right. i ended up with a medium. the fabric was pretty wrinkly on arrival. it is dryclean only. overall it is an easy and relaxed dress appropriate for work but still very cute.
other These pants are great. i am 5'6" and 133lbs. i normally wear medium for athletic bottoms. medium fits well except knee pit area. maybe because they are not very stretching fabric. however, they are still flattering. the material was thick enough and their print hides underwear lines.
other I fell in love with this on-line and when it arrived today i think i love it even more because the white portion of this sweater is really a medium pink color which looks so chic. although i am not usually into pink, this looks so stylish with the pink instead of the white. this is a piece you might find in a vintage store in the village in nyc. can't wait for it to get chilly so i can wear it. for reference, i am 5'1, 36c chest and the small fit perfect. the quality is really high end as well.
other I ordered size small. i am 5' 6", 3other b. the fabric is super soft and the fit is great. there's an adorable little quote on the pantie's lining, and the bra has a beautiful print on its inner lining. the feel of the lace and fabric is divine. love it! one more thing to note...there is very little lining in the bra; really nothing more than an extra layer of fabric. it is enough to protect modesty, but not much else.
other This sweater is stunning. it is extremely well made. tons of tiny little embellishments that get noticed even by the most discerning eye! i've received so many compliments on it. if you want it to fit generously or with extra roominess, i recommend ordering one size up. it fits true to size.
3 Maybe if i sized down to a small i'd like them better.. they look ok from the front. but it seems like the leg was cut way too wide. there is exceess material in the back and leg hole. they are not all flattering to my rear end. overall kind of shapeless and the fabric is prone too wrinkling. too expensive (with the added shipping fee for an online exclusive) for the lack of structure and simplicity.
other This top fits tts. the sweater part is cream, eyelet material is white. love it!
other Love this tunic. i bought it in black and wore it with skinny jeans and flat black boots and received many compliments. can be dressed up for work or worn with distressed jeans on the weekend.
other This dress is perfect for spring and early summer. it has some weight to it and so it drapes beautifully. it is very well made and the fabric is good quality. the color is a medium color gray; much prettier than in the picture. i wear a small in most retailer dresses and this fit perfectly in a small. it hugs in all the right places and skims from the hips just like in the picture.. the length was just as it looked on the model. i am 5' 5".
other I bought this in every color, and would probably keep buying it if there were others - the fit is loose yet flattering, quality is good, feminine pretty ruffles that don't add bulk, and i love that it makes me feel pretty and put-together post-baby.
other This dress is even more beautiful in person. it fits true to size and drapes nicely from the body without being tent-like, as some swing dresses are prone to be. the material is very nice and the pattern is stunning and unique. as someone else mentioned, you can pair this with a cardi for work. it's also perfect for a night out. it's easily dressed up or down. and looks amazing with a skinny belt. i'm happy i bought this one!
other Love this! it's loose and easy for summer, fabric is not too sheer. the asymmetrical ruffle is such a cute feature. washes well. i got the pink for myself (though it's a deep coral color - perfect for me) and the gray for my daughter. wish they'd had the powder blue when i bought ours; i'd have bought that color for her instead.
other This dress is a vintage 20s drop hem style, not meant to be tight to form.  that said, the bottom is loose so may want to size down.  5'2, 14other lbs= s.  i bought the neutral- navy pattern and it is absolutely gorgeus!  hints of peach and beautiful lace detail.  i literally got compliments all day long- from friends and strangers.  i paired it with a dark denim jacket.  absolute must have for sale price.
other Super cute and comfortable. has a shape, not boxy.
other Ok ladies, i love the whole idea behind these pants..cargo, corduroy, what!!!!?? and in a cool different navy color, had to have them. i got my usual size but in petite (i'm 5'5.5" with shorter legs longer torso, usually don't get petite in skinniest, but for some reason did this time) and i have to say the calves of these pants are like compression stockings! the waist and boodie are perfect, but the calves, yikes! but you know how when you want something to work so bad....i ordered my usual si
other Saw these in store and had to have them. online pictures do not do them justice. great pattern, fabric and features. can be dressed up or down. sizing is accurate--i am 5' 4" and 117 lbs and bought an xs. they fit perfectly. wish they had more colors/patterns to purchase.
3 This dress was pretty but had a weird fit. the waist droops down in the middle instead of going straight across, which i found unflattering. i ended up returning it.
other I saw the colors and texture of this top and wanted to love it however when i put it on it just did not work. the cut was so strange. it runs very small in the shoulders and then flairs out so much at the waist. i even ordered up a size based on reviews. i ordered an 8 when i normally where a small (6) in things. the shoulders were still too small and it was way too big every where else.
other The shirt is cute, but there is no way that the length posted on the website is correct--it's a crop top. this was returned.
other Very cute top but it seems like it won't hold it's shape very long. cheaply constructed.
other The dress was great! the zipper was just a little tough but over all a very classic, feminine piece.
other This top is beautiful. so beautiful that i am keeping it even though it is a little bit large and drapey. the fabric has a golden glow to it. the details in the back are darling. perfect for a romantic dinner out.
other If the dress fits, there is nothing not to love about it. the color, of mine, is exactly like the catalogue and first photo online (deeper and richer than the studio photos). it is not too sheer, as another reviewer reported. it has a slip, and the fabric is beautiful.the issue i've had has been sizing and style. i wear a size 2. i ordered an xs. the dress i received was not the style of the catalogue dress or the first dress in the online photos. i was looking for the very floaty, full dres
other This hoodie has a great fit! it is slightly tapered in at the waist so it is not boxy. in fact, it is quite flattering. it has pockets and a cute rubber zipper pull. the hood is a nice size, not overwhelming to the back profile. i purchased the matching pants a few months ago but had not idea when i ordered this. now i have a super cute "lounge at the lake" ensemble.
other I ordered these jeans on sale based on the great reviews, but when the arrived the color looked different from the online pictures. i don't love the color but decided to try them on anyway since i've never tried ag before. well they are so soft and comfortable and fit great! i didn't want to take them off, so i ended up keeping them. now ag is my favorite brand for jeans!
other I purchased a petite size which fit great except for the slip. the slip is at least other inches shorter than dress. super comfy and flattering! perfect for fall with at pair of booties.
other The romper is well made and just plain cute. i bought it the second i saw it and don't regret my impulse buy one bit. 13other 5'5" and the small fit perfectly.
other The dress is lovely. the beadwork creates a nice accent. it runs big. i got a size 0, which should work out just fine for me, but oddly it is big and i wish i got a 00. now there aren't any in that size and i will either have to return the dress or tailor it. i would recommend this dress, just consider ordering a size down from your usual.
other This top is one of my favorites, i can't get over how much i love the design. the dots are adorable and i received a ton of compliments. the back of the top quite a bit longer, and it looks great. my only complaint is that it runs a bit small on the top. even though the shirt is perfectly sized on me, i bent over to slip on my shoe and one of the buttons popped off after less than a minute of wearing it.
other I love these bottoms. great colors. i also love the feel of the bottoms, very soft. high quality.
other This jacket is soft, a beautiful color, the perfect length, and incredibly versatile (a fleece jacket that doubles as a blazer) but i was swimming in it! i wouldn't have minded the larger size, but the sleeves looked ridiculous. i wish i'd ordered early enough to try a petite size, but i'm not sure that would've helped. sad to send this back!
other This looked beautiful online, but the skirt isn't 100% silk - the strips of fabric have different fiber content levels, with most of them containing some level of polyester. parts of the skirt felt like plastic to touch, and one strip has a very prominent gold sheen that looks cheap. overall very disappointing - this is not at all the beautiful silk skirt that it appears to be online.a definite return. i wouldn't even recommend this at first or second cut.
other I have quite a few of these tiny henleys because they are unique and comfortable. the color and details of this one are beautiful. if you are a fan of these too, you won't be disappointed with this one.
other I was hoping this dress was a bit thicker, but when i tried it on the fabric was very thin and sheer. because of the body skimming design, this dress likely won't work on many without some serious spanx or body trimming hosiery. if you work out and are very fit, you might like it, but i don't so i'm not that brave! lol
other This is a beautiful dress but if you have any hips at all you may find it difficult to find the right size. i usually wear a 0-other p and found that that the op was too snug on the bottom while the 2p was too loose on top. ( for reference 32-26-35). so if you are perfectly proportioned it could work for you.also, note that this is a pencil dress....very slim fitting.....probably best suited for a cocktail party.
other I loved this top, however had to return as it does run small. by the time it arrived they were sold out in the larger size. like the quality of cloth and stone, however their products do run a size small.
other Great arm coverage, soft material, flattering fit. wear with favorite worn-in jeans with holes in the knees and also with white jeans and long or short shorts. i really should purchase another color for summer work staple.
other I was able to purchase this on sale and i'm so glad i did. i usually go between a size s and m (133 lbs., 5' 5", 3other d) but the small fits perfectly. the color really isn't dark orange as stated......kind of a cross between rose/pale red/ salmon but i really love the color. it's not super heavy weight but not really thin either....actually perfect!
other I wore this bodysuit once. it had a hole under the arm when i took it off
other This dress is just my style. i have been waiting for it to go on sale since it hit new arrivals. when the sale hit the extra 30% off, i pulled the trigger. unfortunately for me, it was a little snug in the bust and as a tall lady, the waist hit me at slightly the wrong spot. i am 5' 9" and am a 36d. so if you are tall and busty, this will not be the dress for you just from the way it is cut and manufactured. the skirt section of the dress has a hook underneath the vest section that it is pretty
other After reading the reviews i placed an order because it was the only top that caught my eye on the entire price downs. lately all my usual l/10 sizes from retailer turn out huge so i ordered a size smaller from what i usually wear. all would have been ok if the top wasn't so darn short. for reference i'm 6 ft tall, 160 lb. it's weird that this top looks completely the opposite of the model on the photo, from a loose looking fit with longer sleeves looking like a stylized sweatshirt that is not what
other I was hesitant to buy but this tee is easy, light, and fun to wear.  the fabric is light but not see through in the slightest.  the construction is perfect.  it is tts for an oversized tee.
other Oh look i have a booty and would look at that--i have a waist too!  yes this dress is way casual for its price point (soft stretch jersey in a heathered wine color) but it's all forgiven because it fits me like a glove.  i really love the gathered waist detail and what it visually does to my non-hourglass body. wish there were more colors available, i would pick them up in a heartbeat.  i purchased the medium petite.  my stats for fit reference:  5'3" tall, 140#, 36dd, 28" waist, 35" hips, wide
other I love hess overalls. they are true to size and have a great vintage look to them but done in a classic way. i am 5'6" 125lbs and a 34b. i bought the xs and it fit great! they are fitted and not sloppy like a lot of overalls. you can easily dress them up or down. soft and stretchy material is a plus
3 These pants come in great colors and fit nicely if you determine your correct size, which may not be what you usually wear. i have several pair, but i am concerned about investing anymore because of all the complaints on dye stability. retailer is going to have to address this if it is going to continue carrying this product. now, that said, i had a bad accident on one pair of these pants, and the outcome was successful. i wore them to a dinner party and spilled grease on them from one of t
other I purchased this tank in white. the material is very soft, but it is very thick, which i was surprised by, but i still like it. the fit is a little boxy. i have an xxsp and it fits a little large. hangs perfectly - just like the photo. i almost sent it back just because of the boxy look, but i think i make it work this summer. going to keep it!
other I wanted to like this sporty dress too. i teach at an elementary school and like to get down on my knees st my students level - plus we can get messy most days with our learning and most days are go - go - go being "on" every second...the armholes were cut too big and weirdly squared. i didn't like the middle "ridge" either as it was unflattering. it was returned.
other I've been looking for a leather or faux leather jacket for years and years and this is the first one that i've ever loved so much! the style is edgy and modern, yet still feminine and flattering. love the cut of the jacket, so flattering! looks amazing with dresses, skirts or denim. i got the dark red color, and it's much more brown and neutral than it appears online. i would love to get the tan color as well, but it's currently sold out in my size. the faux leather looks believable and expensiv
other I ordered online and got it home tried it on and loved it. it is too cute i plan to wear it with bright colored belt and shoes probably red, yellow, or pink plus i bought a polka dot tote same color cream and black and a blazer can't wait to wear it. i love the fact that i can wear it spring, summer, fall as well winter with my blazer. i'm keeping it.
other I rarely write a really negative review and retailer is my favorite store ever. but this dress is awful. i ordered the black and white. the fabric is very poor quality. the colors are washed out. i almost didn't try it on, but i did and found that, for me, the fit was terrible (though some of the reviewer pictures are cute).
3 I have a curvy figure, and this top is not for me. it fits loose at the top and is tight at the bottom. it is also short. i think this top works best on slender figures.
other I got this shirt in red plaid and love it. super cute without being too trendy. i wore it with shorts and got lots of compliments.
other Originally got one with a stain. retailer quickly sent a replacement,useful with many skirts and pants. well made.
3 I ordered this on sale, after reading the review, but i was disappointed when i tried it on. the color is darker in person, which is better for me, but it looked dull on my skin tone (pale). also, teh sleeves poofed in a weird way on the top where the seam meets the neck. the overall cut is almost flattering, a little long still for me in petite, i felt like i was trying on a regular size. so not for me. for reference, i ordered the 0p (or xsp, not sure right now). i am 11other lbs, 30dd chest, 26.5
other Very comfortable and flattering top, but runs a bit large. i am usually a medium and fit comfortably into the small. the blue stripes are not see through, however i saw  the black motif in stores and it's definitely see through.
other I feel like snagging a pair of these was the equivalent to standing in line for black friday, as they always seem to be out of stock. now i know why. these are soft, comfortable, and slimming. they're somewhere between the hold of control top pantyhose and spans--they don't fall and sag throughout the day and are nicely slimming without being pain-inducing.
other Just grabbed this today! great find. i paired it with a white blouse with blue polka dots....will pair with anything though, with great neutral colors. white or blue jean jackets, sweaters....the skirt has a little stretch for my hourglass figure, but would work with any type body i think. a many season skirt, perfect for traveling.
other Love this top!! perfect date night top! you can dress it up with a cute pair of heels or wear it around doing errands in some flats.
3 I ordered a size 0. the dress was extremely large. i am 5'other and weigh 110. i guess you really must be 5'9 like the model to wear this dress. such a shame..
other I bought this dress as a birthday present to myself which i wore to a recent weekend vacation to dallas, texas and i absolutely love it. i love the color and the design of the dress as i think it is timeless and i will get a lot of use out of it for years to come. however, this dress is tight in the chest area and i would recommend sizing up. i am 5'10", 156 pounds, and usually wear a us size 6, but when i tried this dress on in a size 6 the dress stopped buttoning up underneath my bust. i end
3 This top is cut too short & wide with too much light material in between. to be truly slimming & flattering, it needs to have more of the rayon/spandex blend, to make it heavier & bouncier. then it would "hang" appropriately and "swing" and (hopefully) not add pounds to the wearer. unfortunately this top is too lightweight & has too much material. pass.
other This was a perfectly nice dress, but embroidery was less elegant than i had expected. be sure to look closely at the neckline, where the material is thick and somewhat informal. it's pretty, but doesn't work for me. otherwise, it is a well made, comfortable, easy-to-wear summer dress. (i sent it back, but thought about it for a while first.)
other I absolutely love each this dress! it is shimmery as others have said but the design looks so beautiful that way and i don't agree that it mages it look cheap. love the neckline and the length is perfect unless you're a petite size. i would snatch this one right up if it weren't for the price point. i'm hoping it'll go to sale but it's so beautiful it might be sold out by then . the fabric seems delicate like he threads could come apart easily.
other Ordered this on a whim while taking advantage of a promotion, and now need one in every color! the weight and cut is perfect for fall/winter/summer - not too heavy, but not sheer/tissue thin; fitted enough to look super cute with leggings or skinny jeans. fabric has a nice quality feel to it - i have similar shirts from the past that have held up well in the wash. i'm anticipating the same with this.
other I had to review this because i purchased before any reviews were up and now that i've received this dress i'm appalled by all the positive reviews!!! this dress is hideous in person. seriously hideous. and even if you can get past the drapery fabric, it's incredibly restricting. the picture online is so misleading. the dress isn't even an ivory it's more of a pea green! so disappointed.
other Love the top, it fits wonderfully, and it's lightweight. my only complaint is that it has little loops that are prone to getting caught on things. other than that, it's a great spring top.
other I am a big fan of ag, i'm sure i have 15-20 pairs. i will say that i have rejected some of their offerings in the past because the fabric has been weird: denim that is so stretchy it doesn't look like real denim, fabric is so thin it shows every lump or bump etc.. so i'm always cautious, especially with their stretch twill. that aside, these particular jeans in this gray color are awesome. ag nailed it: great color, supportive, slimming fabric, great length and rise. a job well done ag! howe
other Loved this dress. i am 5'5", 34c, normally wear a other in most. the 0 fit (a other wasn't available in-store), but i will say showed more cleavage on me than in the shown picture.gorgeous dress- wish it were just a little less costly, but would be a great purchase for easter, weddings, etc.
other It's beautiful, but more sheer on bottom than it appears in photo. size up.
other I purchased this dress as an easy option to throw on after the gym or on a weekend trip without fuss. the fabric is soft, hangs well, and it is well-lined. but it's also a little more bilious than perhaps necessary to be beautiful and flowing. as in, i'm very comfortable in this dress, but it's not a dress i receive compliments while wearing. perhaps it reads as maternity wear without the belt.
other Great leggings for the price. they are ultra soft and stretchy. a great pair of leggings to relax in. they are very stretchy and only come in other sizes s/m, l/xl. i am 5' tall and they fit fine, because usually such generic sizing is too large for my small frame. they are a bit long for a petite person, but tucked into boots and nobody will know.
other The 'peach' color is actually a lovely shade of rose and the smocked detailing at the shoulder is exquisite - but there are bold stripes of gold lurex running through the plaid. if you like that kind of thing, you'll love this blouse. it hangs well and is a substantial but airy fabric.
3 I usually wear a small, other or 6 and in this dress i couldn't even zip up the 8. so tight in the rib cage and chest. if i tried to go up even further the bottom half got much bigger. guess this one is not for me.
other I love, love, love this top! the cutout pattern in front is such a unique look and is a great way to add some fun to your usual t-shirt and jeans look. it's well made and the fit is great. i got it in petite s which worked great length-wise.
other I bought this yesterday and love it. it drapes beautifully. it's a little fancy but versatile enough that you could wear it for semi-casual occasions. the first tier hits at the natural waist, while the second tier hits at about hip height. this is very flattering for the waist, while still being drape-y and a bit loose. i thought this fit a little bigger than to size. i am currently postpartum boobed so i am 5'4", 13other lbs and 34dd and the s fit great. (i am currently a s in other retailer tops).
other Tried the xs on in store from an online return, loved the tailoring but the shoulder seams were a bit tight and i'm usually a s in most tops. ordered the s and while it was flowy like some mentioned, it was still tailored on top & flattering. also versatile - wore it with wide leg denim & wedges as well as cut off shorts & boots. my only complaint is as the others mentioned, the almost immediate pilling even before the wash. sad about it because i love it. will keep and give a little extra tlc.
other I really loved the way this shirt looked on me. it's forgiving and flattering, and really lightweight. the fabric, however, couldn't even withstand half a day's wear without snagging 3 times and developing a hole right in the center. i have no idea how this happened, as i wasn't wearing or near anything that could have pulled at it. such a shame. this could have been a staple wardrobe piece for me.
other This is such a cute and different jacket. of course i asked if they had it in black but i am glad they didn't because this is such a great color that is so versatile. i use it as a topper when it is not that cold out with a short sleeve under it or a long sleeve fitted shirt. you can wear with jeans or black pants if you want. great material for the price as well. i am usually between a small but more of a medium in my jackets. i ordered this in xs/s and it has plenty of room to even wear a swea
other I love this pair to add some color to a plain outfit. however, they ran just a tad bigger than i expected.
other I am 5'9 and i wear my usual 27 like i always do in pilcro. i am so sad that they are too short. they are 32.other inches long and it's just too short for my legs even with flats. the fit is great and they run true to size but they are too short for tall girls. i usually buy the wide leg linen pants and those are long enough. these needed to be about an inch longer. i do recommend them if you're a bit shorter :)
other Great sweater with gorgeous detail. fits tts. works best in someone with smaller bust like me. pink is peachy pink like other reviewers have commented. pairing it with gray ag jeans! will work great for fall/winter in louisiana.
3 The top for this suit is great - i'm pretty small up top so it's rare that i find a suit that doesn't gap. however, the bottoms run so small. for reference, i'm a size 0 in dresses and 2/other in pants. i ordered the xs and s to start, both were too small. with high hopes that i could keep this adorable suit (and well made otherwise!), i ordered a size m bottom. they were still small. sadly, i'm giving up and returning. only order this suit if you're super, super tiny on the bottom.
other I'm so glad the other reviewer also found these small. literally, the largest size i have ever bought. but the style is really cute, sort of dapper british boy...
3 This shirt is beautiful and so soft. it would have made a wonderful long-sleeved tee except for the fact that it was so low cut. the only way this is wearable is with a tank underneath which, for me, defeats the purpose of this type of shirt. i am rather busty (3other dd), so maybe if you are smaller on top you might could pull it off.
other This is m frist pair of flares, and i love them--make my legs look miles long and they're also my most comfortable jeans. i'm 5'other and around 108 lbs with narrow hips--the 2other fits perfectly. i've worn them with 3 inch heels and the jeans dust the floor (longer than on the model but i like that look; if i wanted to wear them with flats they'd need to be hemmed, but i prefer heels anyway) ii've avoided high-rise jeans out of fear they'd look matronly, but combined with the flare, the high waist is
other I absolutely love this dress. it is super soft and flattering for my body type (petite and curvy). though, i wish it did come in petite, as the upper body part of the dress would fit a little better. but that didn't stop me from purchasing as that's an easy alteration. very flattering. love it.
other True to sizeneckline is not too low so it's great for workgot the red and it's a lush deep colorquite happy with this purchae
other This top isn't straight as it would seem on the "tucked-in" picture on the model. colros are really rpetty and neutral in eprson. fabric si very soft. i tried on the 0 but am wondering about trying on 00 or petite size...which i would have to order, so will wait a bit on this one.
other I received the sky color in m online.  am definetly keeping it as it is beautiful.  however i wish they had made it a little less wide and more long.  i am other 3 and could totally size down to a s but even at my height it would be too short.  i like crop tops and waist hitting tops a lot.  but the shortness on this one just looks like it shrunk in the dryer
other I received this tank today and i fell in love with it immediately! i am petite (5'3"/36b/108 lbs) and purchased this in the only size left, which was a small. yes....it is very billowy (but i do a half tuck into my pants and that solves the problem perfectly and looks great!!) i have very well toned arms and the way this is cut just accentuatea this! yay!! the fabric is soft and the overall look is super feminine!!! so very happy with my purchase! plan on wearing with jeans shorts/cropped jeans/
other I ordered 3 different styles of jogger pants and these were definitely the ones to keep! true to size and instantly comfortable due to the soft material they are made from. the taupe color i got will go with a lot, too. these are great pants that you won't be sorry you bought!
other This sweater dress is very beautiful in person. the colors are very "fall", i actually decided against it only because i felt it was too busy for my personality. as for the fit, it runs fairly true to size, maybe slightly small. i tried on my usual medium, but i think i would have sized up for a more relaxed look. for reference, i'm 5'6", 13other lbs, and wear a size 6. this could be quite a stunning piece on the right person!
other Perfect! wanted a dress for a mexican vacation. this fits the bill exactly. fabric has enough weight to hang well and cover any "flaws". love!
3 I tried this jacket on and it was definitely cute but a couple things to note. it's a wool acrylic blend and it was already starting to pill from being tried on in the store. also, it's unlined. i thought the price point was high given its fibers and unlined. given its hem, i wonder how much longevity the piece has and how quickly it might start to look dated too.
other Just purchased this lovely sweater over the weekend during the 25% off sale. i went in to buy the rona sweater in grey (which i think is the same style with different name) but it was all sold out! the sa pointed me to a rack of these sweaters and i am happy with this choice! the back print is really cute and the sweater design and color is very flattering. it goes well with pants or skirt, and the front is not as short as i had imagined the rona sweater to be.
other Purchased this in-store today. i'm normally a small, but tried on x-small before trying on my regular size. the x-small fit perfectly. i'm 5"5, 13other lbs, with wide hips and petite derriã¨re. the dress fit well, slightly hugging my bottom. while i don't like things that draw attention to my bottom, with an outward tug or two of the stretchy material of the dress, it fit perfectly. sweater dresses tend to be bulky, so it makes sense to down size. definitely a nice addition to my closet.
other Upon entering a local retailer store, i saw this top almost instantly and decided to try it on. fyi: 36c, broad shoulders/back, high waist, 5'3" (almost), and i normally wear a 1other in a fitted, button-up shirt. i can go down to a 10 in a loose-fit one, but with the buttons i wouldn't expect this to be "loose-fitting". i wear a m or l in a knit top. i tried this on in 12, but it was too big in the armholes and chest, causing the top to stand out too much from my body. when i tried on the 10, these
other These pants are very cute for spring/summer, and i enjoy having the option of a looser silhouette with a bit of length (nearly all of my pants are a cropped skinny these days!). i agree with the other reviews that have described the leg as being less straight-legged than they are pictured. on me, they have a subtle flare -- nothing major, but just enough to break perfectly over my shoe. they fit tts on me, but i did need to have the hem taken up. i'm 100 lbs, 5'0 and the 0p fits perfectly. i hav
3 As you can see, there is an array of differing opinions on here, and i share sentiments on both:_______pros:- the texture and feel of this is great; it is very comfortable and is different.- tts for the most part; i normally can wear sizes 10 and 1other (m and l) with most retailer and got the medium and the fit was overall fine but more snug at the hips. if you're more slim/straight, it'll probably fit you like on the model. - good length, not too short or too long.- the mock collar is ni
other Love love love! it's the perfect cozy, comfy piece for a bitterly cold day. and the color is such a nice shade for the dreary winter.
3 The fabric is super soft and comfortable and the look is cute, however the drape on the front crossover is not great and doesn't flatter well. the shorts will probably run a little on the short side for some - i'm very short (5') and the length is great for me but i'm guessing not for the average height.
other I love the perfect length of these! i am 5'6" and i love subtle capris which are very hard to find (unless i tailor them of course) but these are the perfect length and the color is great i have worn them twice and was stopped over and over again by people asking who made them. new favorite!! the waist runs a little tight but legs and tush are true to size!!
other It is a pretty dress but runs large, i usually wear small and i ordered a regular xs because they are out of petite... it fits and since i am pregnant it works but it is a little large around the waist...the lace is beautiful and the quality is amazing
other I'm. 5'other and based on other reviewer's input, i went with a regular rather than petite and the length works well. the top is cute, but it billows out around the waist which isn't apparent on the model. other reviews mentioned that so i bought it anyway with that information and it's fine if you expect that. i'm a 34dd and find it to be a bit tight in the bust.
3 I ordered a medium and it fit perfectly. i am anywhere from a size 6-8. 5'9, 155lbs.sadly, i am returning this dress because the horizontal stripes make my hips look huge.
other This dress is so cute and comfortable. i'm normally a 0 or other and the xs is plenty roomy even though this is a clingy knit. the nice cotton under slip hides all the bumps and bulges. only worry is whether or not the loose weave will pick and how it will clean but so far i am thrilled.
other The sweater material was really soft and seemed well-made. the back is an interesting twist, but the material creases easily; i can see it looking messy by the end of the day. the main reason i returned it though was because it runs very large. i got my usual s, and i could have sized down 1, maybe even other sizes. i didn't like it enough to try a smaller size.
other This dress was cute in the photos but wore like a sack when i put it on. great quality, fabric was lovely, just a little sparkle at the hemline, scallops were great but i put it on, i immediately took it back off and put it back in the sack to return. love the look, it just was terrible on me. i'm petite, 5'0" and weigh 110# so i'm not large but the dress made me look like an oompaloompa.
other I tried this on in the store, in regular size (i often need petite). i think on this one, i could go either way.the cut is flattering fit and flare, and the colors are rich. i like the "flowery" design, good spring piece in my opinion, as it has components of all kinds of seasons: sleeveless and see-though material, buthe design part is almost like a fine corduroy, very soft. not too flimsy iether.
other This skirt is very pretty, but not only does it run small but only a small portion of the waistband is elasticized, so there's very little stretch. for those of us with a significant difference in our waist and hip measurements, there's no way to get this skirt on past the hips.
other I got other of these dresses, one in the navy with small flowers and the gray/yellow print. i am 5other and the navy looked a little old fashioned on me. i think if you are younger it would be super cute. the gray/yellow diagonal stripe is super cute! it's a more modern design in the fabric and i love it. it will be my favorite go to dress for the summer. i also think it will pack nicely for trips. i am 5'7" and wear a small or medium with retailer clothes and i got a small in this dress and it's p
other This top runs large. i am usually a medium in retailer but when i read the first review, i ordered a small, and it was the right decision. i also agree that this top might be short for someone with long torso. love the back detail and the print and color is really nice!
other I love the way the neckline is open not too low ! it also falls on your hips just right.great buy
other What a great piece. so unique and so cool and made with high quality textiles. i expect this to be in heavy rotation. can go super casual/luxe with leather joggers or upscale with nice jeans and some heels.
other I usually wear a size small in deletta. i am 5'5" and 140 pounds. the small ran true to size for me. saying that i am a size 8 so usually everywhere else i can take small or medium, so i can see how reviewers say it runs big. love the ruffles on this tank. makes it a little more special. super comfy and easy to wear. will be great for hot summer days in florida!
other I bought a pair in both black and green. i sized up one size because of previous reviews. i am happy with the fit. they are very comfortable, look good and keep their shape. the only negatives are after two washings, (following the directions-cold water, no dryer), the black has faded and the hook closure on one is difficult to close and the other was barely attached. overall, i would still recommend them.
other This top is comfortable and yet with some stylish detail. the fabric is soft and the lilac color looks great. it hangs loose but with a nice drape. at the sale price it is not to be missed.
other Immediately loved this when i saw it online and even more in person. i'm only 5'1' so i tried the petite sizing first but ended up buying the regular in an xs for the slightly longer length. the regular fit me like the model in length and i probably could have taken the xxs except the sleeves were too narrow in that size. i like that the cuffs are long so if you have to turn it up (like i do) it doesn't look weird. also, i found the fit flattering at the hips, following my hourglass shape withou
other Mine was slightly tight across the bust area, but i'm able to leave it open with a light tank underneath. it still looks great!
other At 5'4" and 140 lbs, this tank is a nice thin under layer. a little low cut for trying to cover cleavage.
other This dress is beautiful with gorgeous coloring, nice thick, stretchy fabric and wonderful detailing including buttons. the only issue i had with it is that it's does run small, especially in the bust. i'm normally a medium to large, depending on cut so after reading the previous reviews, i ordered a large and it's pretty snug. still deciding whether i will keep or try for an xl, which is doubtful in availability at this point. i ordered it with two other pieces, both of those a medium fit fine.
3 I ordered this in the blue, it's a beautiful shade of blue. love the lace up detail in the back, but the size small was just short and very wide. i understand it is a swing top, but this was not flattering on me. i'm short waisted, 34-d, 5'3, 12other lbs.  i'm sure it would be cute on a very thin person.
other I love everything about this jumper - it's so comfortable without being too warm. it's easy to dress up with booties and a hat. i suppose the only possible downside is that it's slightly tight at the ankles, but honestly - this is like a dream.
other I thought this sweater was cute online but turns out it is even cuter in person! the cotton linen blend makes it easy to layer over a tee shirt or blouse, and the neutral color goes with everything!as a side note, included with my sweater was a signed postcard informing me that this item was not on hand at their distribution center. so they "sounded the horns", and their spokane, wa store "saved the day". thank you spokane, wa store and thank you meredith for packing with care! i love it!
other This is a very comfortable top -versatile in that you can dress it up or down. i'm happy with it!
other Great fit and very flattering if you have curves. perfect to throw over just about anything. i've only owned it for 9 days and have worn it four times.
other I bought this top in white and my usual size large based on other reviews.  the sleeves are wonderfully long enough for this tall girl, which means that they are likely very long on shorter gals.  i love the style of this t.  the white is slightly see through, but with a nude color bra works ok. i do wish that it didn't cut up so high on the sides.  this probably isn't an issue with shorter people, but i need to wear something under it to avoid showing skin.  i've tried a white camisole under an
other So i got this on sale and the only size they had was a xs petite. i didn't have my hopes very high but i thought i would give it a shot. the dress came today and it fit great. i am 5"6" so the petite came just above my knees but the dress is still adorable. the material and cut is great. this is not what i was looking for but it is a welcome addition.
other I saw this a few months back and wanted it then and now i bought it. i missed a few promos but i ended up getting it at full price in a large, my usual size i like in the pilcro denim jacket line. i love pilcro and have several of this brands denim jackets and each one is very special. i love the use of the plaid details. it has a weathered appearance - the denim and my distressed treatments are not too severe, as some reviewers have commented on the "holes" . i will say this jacket runs small.
other This top is adorable and looked pretty on, but when i raised my arms the top wanted to rise up and then stay there above the breast level. it didn't settle back into place when i lowered my arms. maybe a larger size would have helped, but then it would have been a boxy fit. i also found it hard to take off, even with the button on the back of the neckline. the length is cropped, so you would want to wear it with a high-waisted skirt or pants. i like the details in the fabric a lot, but i didn't
other I love this dress! i do agree with the other reviewers - it does come up higher on the sides. it has a hi-lo hem style on me, but i'm short (5'3") and got the petite xxs and it's not too short to wear as a dress. it's super cute!! if you're short(er) and don't mind showing a little leg, i highly recommend it :)
other Cute shirt. i thought from the model that it would be big so sized down. it's more snug than i expected so will send back and re-order in normal size. might order other size up and compare.
other I love this stylish sweater. i ordered black. it is very soft and comfortable. i wear it with snaps open or closed. looks great either way.
3 Sooo this adorable blouse is indeed different than pictured. no ruffle, such a bummer, sleeves are much longer, and yes it's teared in the front and back. also the button opening on the back is much longer/larger, in my opinion. i'll most likely keep it, but consider the mentioned if buying.
other Because of how much i have been buying recently, i didn't *want* to like this dress. i just tried it on because it's such a classic dress. i'll probably wear it all year-round, dress it up or down, and it'll probably last for ages. so i tried it and it's cute. and flattering. and practical. and the scallop neckline in the back is just enough of a tease to be fun without being too obvious. (it does get a bit cold though so adding a scarf is recommended, though maybe not the davy crockett one the
3 This is a beautiful shirt, however the cut and drape were off. i'm only 10other pounds, but this top made me look pregnant. the fabric jutted out at the front. it's a shame, because it really is lovely. i sent it back.
other I love these jeans! you can dress them up or down.
other These pants are so comfortable and cute!! you can dress them up or down!
other I am 5.other and 113lbs. i ordered the petite size 26 and it fits like a glove. i gave other starts as i wish i had less stretch in it but other than that they are perfect length and sooo soft. super happy with the cut and waist height!
other This is my first romper and i am in love.  so comfortable and easily dressed up or down.  i am usually an xs, small, or petite small in retailer brands.  the xs worked best for me.  the petite small was too big.  i am 5'2" and the length of the xs is perfect ankle length.  i was nervous to put it in the washer on delicate cycle but it came out perfectly.
other Bought the gold pair and dripped something on them so spot cleaned them with water only. my white washcloth turned bright yellow. the food came out but surrounding area was super faded. so i returned them, took the second pair home, wore them a few times, they stretched out so much, washed them in cold water and they have splotches that are really light. these pants are way too much trouble.
other Fit and flare, pullover style that can easily be dressed up or down. wish other colors were available online!
other Just a heads up because i didn't notice the pink in the blue motif print until it had arrived. almost sent it back - changes the overall aesthetic, makes it harder to layer in winter, black shoes stand out more etc... but i don't really like the orange print and i'm a red head... so i'm keeping it but it would have been amazing if it were cream and blue. i also bought the emerson swing dress. this dress runs tts (emerson runs a touch larger). i'm 5'5" and the dress came to just barely above my k
other Found this little surprise in store yesterday where thankfully one of my atlanta stores carries petites. the materials is wonderful - feels like cashmere. i got the rust which will be an anytime-anywhere piece!. recommend highly.
other So glad i purchased this top! it has great style and can be matched with just about everything. the material is very soft and it seems really durable.
other I'm very pleased with my purchase of this dress. it is perfect for dancing or a spring/summer wedding or doing out. it is very flattering on my rather straight/slender/petite frame. i ordered a size other and it was tts. if it only had pockets, it would be absolutely perfect!
other I absolutely love these shorts. i ordered a medium. i was nervous they would be too small, (my legs aren't the skinniest), but because of the slit on the side, they were fine. i do have a pretty tiny waist, and they were slightly snug but not too much to send them back. i am almost 5'7' and weight 145. i have a solid black one piece suit and they look great with it. i love the material as well, they are extremely comfortable. a little pricey, but i will definitely make use of them. i love the pr
other I ordered this sweater in a s and i am happy with the sizing. i am 5'6" 130 and athletic build, it is not a long sweater and looks just like the sweater on the model. i typically like longer sweaters but this will look great with a pair of flare jeans and a nice belt.
other I love the design and the fabric, but the fit is just off on this dress. the area around the bust is just not fitted well. the wrap portion of the dress in this area gaps and does not lie flat. that is an easy enough fix with a good seamstress, but the waist also sat too high on me (maybe i'm long waisted, who knows?), so between the super high waist and the flannel-type fabric, it just looked kind of like a bath robe on me. i wish it weren't so. i was so hoping for a cool plaid dress that i cou
other It's a cute top but once i washed in cold water and laid flat to dry it shrunk and lost it's shape. very disappointed. i am going to return top.
other This dress is so different from any you normally see and its gorgeous. the blue on bottom is actually a much brighter blue in person than in the pictures on the site. the dress pleats along every blue line, so when you walk, it's as if the dress changes colors with every movement. it's fully lined so nothing shows underneath and it's just really beautiful. i also like how the back opens, but not all the way down, so you can wear a strapless bra without the back showing. but the sizing was a bi
other Love the color, fit and feel of these jeans.  the thin material is stretchy and comfortable. i didn't have to pull them up every so often during a 3 hour party.  they didn't bag out after the first wearing and are true to size.  i got a 27p (5'2", 115#).  the leg length is perfect and ends at the ankle.  the rise wasn't too low for me.  highly recommend!
other I had fallen in love with the coral dress that was somewhat like this one and came out a few months ago. but the problem i'm having with this one is the same problem i had with the coral one. they are all flawed in their construction! i had eventually tried 3 size 16s in the coral because each one was flawed. on one, one side hung longer than the other, and on all 3, the top design did not line up with the bottom design. this blue one is the same way! the top design does not line up with the bot
other I love this dress so much, very detailed and comfortable. looks great with the pilcro vest.
other I love this dress so much i bought it in other colors, it's so soft and cozy, i want to live in it!
other I ordered my normal size large and it fit well although a bit on the long side. the fabric has a waffle texture that's lightweight but warm and cozy. i got the blue and the color was a bit intense in combination with the tie dye affect and waffled texture. my favorite part are the lighter striations on the neck. that opening is really small. it just didn't suit me, so i returned but recommend giving it a try if it's calling your name.
other I love this top and cannot wait to wear it. the material is a nice weight, the color is pretty, and the fit is very flattering and comfortable. be aware that it does have an elastic waist and the design is very delicately sewn and could tear easily.
other I ordered this dress in the blue color. it is lovely in person - but the petite seemed to run smaller than most petite dresses i buy from retailer. i ordered a 2p - and it was tight in the bust on me. i imagine a 4p would be perfect. i am 117 5'3 34b.
other Love this top and wish they had more colors in xs, but the sale was too good so they were sold out. i'm 5'10" 140 lbs, an xs fits great. will go with jeans or leggings.
other Love this substantial pieced suede skirt by leifsdottir. the photos i posted show the color in daylight on a cloudy day. a bit more muted darker turquoise than the online pictures. imagine a mini pencil skirt made of non-stretch polyester with a suede front panel. over this is the longer, open skirt, which is attached at the sides to keep it from flying up when you walk..sizing: based on the reviews i risked ordering this in a 00p. i'm 5'2", currently 33-25-37ish with narrow hips, fuller behin
other I'm worried about the quality of the shirt. it looks like it may snag easily. i've decided to keep it, so hopefully i will get some use out of it. in hindsight i would have not bought it when considering the price and quality of the shirt.
other Looks fitted on, but this just turned out to be an oversized muumuu on. the fabric also felt cheap.
3 Nice material, hits high waisted, mine was a return that was not repacked and was just balled in the bag and was so wrinkled that even if it looked good, you couldn't tell. very disappointed to have it arrive in that condition-so not typical of retailer.
other I love the colors, the material, the design details (especially the white pattern at the end of the sleeves). the sweater is super soft and cosy. i got it in s because i wanted it to be nicely fitted. i am on tops between s and m. i am of tall , narrow build and athletic, which means i have well developed but still slim muscles in my chest, arms and shoulders. to accomadate that i often need m even though the rest of me is an s ;). anyhow, i was a bit surprised. in s the sweater fits very snug i
other I bought this in the white, size m (140lbs., 5'8", 34b) because i wanted a baggy fit, which i got, so this is tts. the white is more of an off-white rather than a bright white, which i like because i happen to be looking for an off-white tee. and the shape is good--even in a larger size, this tee nips in at the waist.however, the quality of this tee is lacking, as it is the typical, cheap, marled, slightly see-through material that seems to be everywhere these days and the band on the back of th
other I tried on this top in store & was a bit wishy washy on it at first. however i am so glad i bought it and have worn it 3x in a week (shh!). it is incredibly lightweight & breathable which is great for hot texas summers. i also love that it has interesting back detail. the other reviewers mentioned it was see through but i don't agree - i wear a nude bra with it and have no issues. it can be worn casually with shorts or dressed up with white denim & fancier accessories. either way it looks best w
other I tried this one with the free ship/20% without much expectation so i was surprised by this nice piece. i am not usually a fan of sheer shirts, but this one manages to be sheer yet not see through! the black color works that magic. the linen makes this a nicer material rather than the usual knit. i am not usually a linen fan as it gives me the itches, but this is soft and light. the back is really beautiful and brighter colors in person. the balance between the front and back lengths does work a
other Really cute and comfortable. i can wear it to work for a casual friday, or out on the weekend. a lot of the sequins are falling off and getting stuck in my dryer!
3 I really like how this looks on the model, but in real life this top is much tighter. i was hoping for a good layering top and have been playing around with the trend of lace up tops. i bought it without trying on figuring a small would work, but it was much too tight and the lace top reminded me of vans shoes. i returned it, a girl much tinier than myself has it and it is very cute on her. so, best works on a model body type figure than someone with even slight hips.
other This dress is breathtaking! it is super lightweight and will be the perfect addition to my suitcase for summer travels! can be dressed up or down with jewelry & heels.
3 Love pilcro jeans and really hoped these would work for me. lovely soft material (98% cotton/2%, which you don't see often anymore!), great length, nice medium rise but for me the deal breaker was the lack of belt loops. the braided detail at the waist is a fun design touch, but as someone with a small waist and wider hips, i almost always have to wear a belt with jeans and that's just not possible with these. if you don't usually wear a belt or have a straighter figure, these might work better
other This dress makes me looks curvy,thin and sexy! i tried on almost every dress in the store in every style. this one was a winner. i bought other others but this one was my favorite. i'm 5'5" 130 (32dd) szother fit perfect. the picture on-line does not do it justice - you must give it a chance and try it on for yourself. it looks like an average dress on the model - if you have curves you'll love this dress!
other I just adore this top! it is so comfy and stylish. i wear it with a little purple cardigan and feel like an iris in bloom. like other reviewers have mentioned though, the straps are way too long. i had to cut them down and re-sew to make it wearable. before that it just slouched in front and looked sloppy and awful. i tried layering under it, which looked absurd.
other This dress is so cute! will you be bringing it back retailer?
other I'm 7 months pregnant and bought this dress yesterday, it is perfect! the wrap design makes it possible to expand the skirt and still look cute. i'm 5'3" bought the small and look forward to wearing this after i deliver as well.
other I bought this dress for a couple fall weddings to hide my postpartum belly. it was only available in a size 8 -- which is my typical size. i was nervous based on the reviews it would still be too big, but it fits perfectly. i am 5'10", so i assume my frame can handle the drappiness well!
other This top looks so much better on than it does in the pictures! very flattering cut and the fabric is amazingly comfortable. runs true to size, i got my normal xs.
other This dress is gorgeous! i sized up from my usual 6 to an 8, cause i'm not much for form fitted dresses. however, it was still pretty body con for me. i passed in it for now, but in the future i might try a 10 petite?? the color is a nice brick red with a textured whitish pattern. and it is soft ... like i wanted to snuggle up on the couch in it, but i had to refrain! i've been having bad luck with zippers from retailer dresses recently, but this one was smooth sailing and pretty too! the length wa
other I purchased this in store and the red motif is short sleeved as pictured. the pattern is fun, vibrant and great for summer months. it's a more substantial weight fabric, not sheer or clingy. the fit is tts and it is a slightly longer length which i loved.
other I like the edge of this dress and it balances my narrower hips well. i'm usually between 0p and 00p in retailer dresses and xxsp definitely fit better on my 5'1" frame (armpits and knee-length where it should be)love that it's machine washable and unusual. super soft and beautiful color even though i normally gravitate to cooler colors.bring it on everleigh!
3 I am very into the lace tops! purchased this but it's a very exaggerated swing top and on someone who is 5'3, it feels almost like a tunic. lots of extra material in the back. love the look and if you're tall enough, it should work for you!
other Love love love this turtleneck! it's soft and cozy, and i've already reached for it on several chilly days. it definitely runs large. i sized down and it still has an oversized, swingy shape.
other This piece didn't make sense to me.  maybe it's bc i'm a yankee fan but it reminded me of a high end baseball jersey that was sheer.  i didn't think it was office appropriate but too dressy for casual wear.  it went back.
other I was looking for a dress that had a lot of color. since i usually stick to neutrals, this was out of my comfort zone, but i found this one and loved it. it's comfortable, not clingy, and i can wear a regular bra (bonus!). i wish the waist wasn't dropped, but i think it worked well. i plan on wearing it more in the spring/summer, dressing it up or down will be easy. i'm usually a size 1other and this fit true to size.
other This dress can be flattering on any figure type - but especially for women who need a little curve. i always wear a 6 in hd, and this fits nice and snug around the middle with a becoming flirty skirt that is lower in the back than front. flat chested women will have to fill it out with a padded bra. it may not be a great cut for a short person, as it has a long line to it and lots of busy-ness. only drawback, which depends on your taste, is the yellow pattern - it's a weird kind of greeny yellow
other This dress will take you through fall, winter and spring. i love all the stitching and design detail. it has a nice swingy skirt that is quite a bit longer in the back.
other I love this jumpsuit. it's fun, flirty, and seems to put a smile on the faces of passersby. it works for multiple occasions/events, and is so comfortable. if daytime pajamas sounds good to you, this is your jumpsuit. dress it up with an up-do and dangly earrings, or down with slip-ons and a cardigan, i have found that i can't go wrong with it. fits me just perfectly, doesn't wrinkle too much during wear, and the adjustable shoulder ties are convenient.
other This dress is incredible soft and flattering. it sits higher on the waist than most other dresses i've received from retailer, which is actually great for me, as i have a short torso. i have been able to put it in with the regular wash cycle, which was a pleasant surprise. the only issue was with the overlapping fabric on the top; i ended up adding an extra stitch to avoid being totally exposed.
other Gorgeous top, very nice. detail work, soft and flattering. i don't think its too full on the bottom at all - mine has a loose but pretty straight silhouette. word of warning: soft pink is not pink it is peach with some pink - and definitely not my color. if peach isn't flattering on you, heed this and other reviewers comments they are weighing correctly! i will have to either return for the white or dye the fabric myself to a more flattering shade, bummer that i thought the other reviewers might
3 My girlfriend and i both purchased these leggings in grey. we love the color because it goes with so many things.the problem is they do not fit the same. hers ran true to size and mine ran small. i am tempted to reorder another pair to see if they fit differently.
other Adorable & unique swtr & wld go w/ many things. note that other front pocket is slightly higher than the other. looks that way in the pic too. it's the "retailer unique touch". i don't mind abt that. it's too itchy for me. i ordered the sp to have shorter arms-fell just above my knuckles which is fine. i have many t-necks to wear under it but i decided i really didn't need another itchy swtr, so returned. no worry, retailer has plenty of other items of interest!
other Cute denim shorts that roll up or down. perfect with everything.
other Love this jacket!got my usual size medium and is perfect! beautiful quality
other This is a beautiful dress. the detail is amazing, but it runs a little small. i'm usually size 0, but i had to go up a size in this dress. its cut a little too tight, and there is no give in the fabric. otherwise its stunning!
other Beautiful lace detail and very soft material. runs a little big.
3 Let me start by saying that i cannot wear wool. it doesn't matter what type it is or if it is combined with cashmere, it makes me itch so much that i just can't do it and i didn't not find this as itchy as others stated. that being said, you definitely need to size down. i am a standard small and purchased the xs and there is still a load of fabric. i still don't know what to think. i think it is okay but i am not sure it justifies the price point.
other I'm a m/l size in most things....depending on the maker and design. i tried this vest on with the paired top in the photo and couldn't believe how big and boxy it was. very boxy. it looked dumpy on my 5'3" frame. i thought it might work because i have broad shoulders to hang the vest off,but noooo. i have breast and that ruined it. well there you go, a size 36c wasn't going to help with this one. but i'm going to try sizing down to a small to give it a chance in fitting better. it runs at least
other Very nicely made sweater which fits well. i bought the black with white accent and am very pleased with my purchase. the small fit me perfectly (34d) can't wait to wear it this fall!
other This dress is more beautiful in person.this dress fits well on top for my broad shoulders, chest(40c)and through my straight hips. note. the side bottom panels are very stretchy. i will have it tailored slimmer. so if you are bottom curvy, this dress is awesome!
other I just received this dress and i love it. after reading the reviews i was worried that it would be too tight so i ordered both a 6 and an 8. i am 5'8", hourglass, 13other lbs, and the 6 is just perfect. i love how it falls just below the knee, but the front slit gives it that little flirt factor. this is the go-to summer dress i had been looking for!
other This tank is super amazing. very versatile - wore to work with dress pants and flats, and wore out to dinner with jeans and heels. a bit out of my comfort zone since it is a "swing" tank, but love the color and cut! perfect for professional life and going out on the town. i did choose a petite in this due to the long armholes (even though i have a long torso for my body size).
other I loved the color and design until i tried it on in the store. i am 5'5" with a slender build. i tried my usual xs but couldn't manage to put this shirt on me without risking smear my makeup or scratch my face by the elastic band at the neckline. the band is so small even fully stretched out. i have a normal sized head just in case you wonder... i gave up after wrestling with it. i can only imagine how uncomfortable to wear something with a tight elastic band choking me...funny... but not funny.
other Very cute and comfortable dress. run true to size. i usually wear a other and the s fits nicely. stretchy and soft!
other I purchased both the coral and cream. the coral is more rustic than vibrant and to me, more orange than a true coral. but for summer, is probably super cute. i found this ran large. for reference, i am 5'8'' 128lbs and purchased a small, my usual size in retailer. i kept the small in the cream but if i were to keep the coral, i would have sized down to xs. you can adjust a little, but the arms were loose and coral didn't look as good if not fitted. super cute with jeans and a tee, with yoga pants,
other I am 5' 5" 150 lb and i usually wear a 10 or 1other in tops because i don't like clothing too tight on top. i took a chance and got the xl because it was all that remained. now i wish i could be more! please bring this back retailer!
other I saw this dress in the store window and gave it a try. i found it to be super flattering and feminine. the bodice is form fitting and the skirt flares out to a full skirt. the colors are fun and vibrant. the neckline is a bit low for work but perfect for evening. it is true to size.
other Just bought this for easter and it fits beautifully! not only is the cut very flattering, but the colors and fabric are perfect for spring!
other This top isn't so much on the hanger but very cute once you try it. the neckline is really cut low so a pin or stitch is necessary. the length on the regular is perfect for my shorter body. if you have a long torso it might not work for you. love how the layers conceal but do not overwhelm your body.  i purchased my regular size medium in black. for reference: 5'6", 14other lbs, 34dd.
other The prima is soft and silky. they fit true to size, maybe a little tight in the waist. while the color is more of a wine it looks nice with a lot of my fall blouses and sweaters. you will be pleased with this purchase.
other I am returning this dress as it looks pretty matronly once it's on. the top was also very tight in the arms and chest (i am 5'9", 140lbs, and 34d).
other The denim is soft and very comfortable, the color also is very dark and goes well with most anything. the style is 'oversized' for baggy look and for that reason the sides of the over-alls gape open requiring a long top. i usually wear a size other in citizen jeans, and ordered small in the overalls and had to return for an xs. i do recommend for comfort and fun. they look great with booties or flats and hit just at the ankle.
other I love these shorts!!! they are thin lightweight and not see through. however the reviews are correct. i am usually a size other or other in shorts. i am 5'1" 11other pounds and i had to size up to 6.. i was able to zip the shorts up but the fit wa a little tight. the 6 offered me the comfort of more room.. overall nice shorts..
3 This is a cute shirt, but it has slits at the bottom of the hem so that the front bottom of the shirt has this small rectangular "flap." it's not visible from the photo. i think it'll have to be returned for this reason.
other These run a tiny bit large, but i'm still keeping them. they are so soft and comfortable!
other This is a great summer dress. i bought this dress in both l and xl because this brand varies. i kept the l because the fit was better. the xl was wider and had larger armholes the fabric and colors are beautiful. lots of compliments, it is lined, highly recommend.
other This top is exactly what i was hoping for except it is missing the drawstring. so disappointing, mailing it back.
other This is a really nice white button-up top. per usual, the cloth ant stone material is awesome! ... and a machine washable blouse! the side buttons are a really cute feature as well. i found this top fit true to size, and i took my usual xs.
other These are beautiful pants - pretty basic, but comfy and you can dress them up. they definitely run large in both length and waist. i'm 5'10" and having a little bit of a platform or heel is helpful.
other Just got this dress and am very pleased.  fell in love with the bright color in the store and then came home ordered it at a great sale price!!  color is as shown...beautiful lace trim at the bottom.....back longer than front as described and pockets!!  i am 5'2" and length on a large comes to just below the knees..in front....i may wear leggings under it...dont like the slip as it is far too tight...will wear a tee or turtle under it..  quality heavier fabric. roomy... linen and cotton.
other This is a beautiful dress! not too interested in yellow but needed it for a wedding this summer. i usually wear a large but returned it for a medium - the large armhole was a little too big. super comfortable and easy.
other Runs a little big, but cute and comfortable. also shows bra straps a bit on each side, even when i ordered a size smaller. overall, very happy with it.
other I love the details that this cardigan has. try it!
other It's maybe a bit longer than i'd like but cute-great with slacks or dresses!
other The wide strap style is very flattering. this tank is fitted in my normal size small, it fits like the model in the cobalt blue color. i'm 5'7" 120lbs. if you want more room, i'd size up. it is low cut, but not inappropriately so. fits like the picture shows.
other I want to the store to try this skirt on. that had only one size m in stock (my size) and it was huge! i ordered an xs and it fits nicely. it's just what i needed for the warm days ahead.
3 This is an average top. i thought it would be a good work shirt (my office is very causal), but it was just too loungey looking. fit is true to size. the fabric is thin- a little see through. not worth $108 in my opinion. i returned it.
other I was returning some things when i saw these jeans and had to try them on! they must be magical pants, because they are slimming and very flattering! amazing jeans!
other I love this top. i bought it in the blue but loved all the colors. i fell in love with it on-line and hesitated ordering it only because i was afraid that the arm holes would be too large (based on what i saw in the picture). fortunately they had it at my local retailer, so i was able to try it on. my usual xs fit perfectly. great flow, soft and casual. perfect for those cool nights in the summer or layered with a cardigan in the winter.
other This is a beautiful piece - but not if you need a hardy sweater. the material is lovely as are the two colors i saw. but it is lightweight and delicate. i tried an xxxs petite which is my norm and it fit perfectly. i did not buy it as for the price and relative usefulness, i had to say no. i will watch for sale.
other Really like this top. colors are great for summer into fall and beyond. can be worn on or off shoulder. it is longer, but not tunic length. covers your bum. i haven't loved a couple of other off shoulder tops i got at retailer, but this one i do. the fabric isn't "puffy" so i don't balloon out under the bust. i am 5'6" 123lbs and 32d. got the small because i wanted length. would have even got the medium but the neckline was too wide.
other I tried this top in the store and i really like it. i am 5'2", 34b with wide shoulder, tried on my usual size s in both colors and they both fit fine. however, i found that the ivory one fits a little bit loser compared to the blue one (by the way, the blue looked more like dark grey in person). the length of the ivory one seems to be a little bit longer than the blue one as well. since it is a drapery top, i like it to be roomy, so i purchased the loser/longer ivory one. it looks great with a j
other I received this dress as a gift and it has become such a great addition to my wardrobe! i love that i can wear it to work and then out with friends. a great value if you're looking for one special piece that you can get miles out of - you can wear the two pieces separate or together. i love floral and felt this non traditional take on a floral was very refreshing.
other Beautiful warm vest. originally bought small but had to exchange for extra small. i love that it reversible and has a hood.
3 I was excited to order this sweater. when it arrived, the green didn't stand out as much as the picture here. it also felt too itchy. i usually wear either very soft wool or wool with cashmere because i can't stand plain thick heavy wool. this one was just too itchy for me, it is going back.
other This sweater is very pretty. i had my concerns being that i don't normally pay $300.00 for a sweater but i found the material to be extremely high quality and the details really make it a beautiful piece. i literally got a little tired of people telling me all day how pretty it was. this is definitely a piece of clothing i will cherish for years to come.
3 Bought this shirt because i loved the cut and the stripes. had little to no shape to it. some may think it runs big but it appears that is the look this top is going for. i feel like being short, i just looked kind of dumpy on me. fabric is nice but borders on see through. it was just ok....nothing exciting.
other Love this sweater. ordered white, size large. great light layer! the weave in the yarn is really pretty; the variations in texture have an almost burnout look. the silver buttons are unusual, really stand out and complement the overall look of the sweater. it has an uneven hem that drapes beautifully at the back and sides. great value on sale! one of those basics that everyone needs in their wardrobe.
3 I love the fabric however the overall fit did not work for me. i think the arms are much smaller than the overall shirt.
3 Overall, it's a beautiful dress, and i really wanted it to work. but the material feels cheap (at least not what you'd expect for the price), and as other reviewers have mentioned, it's just a tad too short. for reference, i'm 5'5, 12other lbs and the other fit well, but hung well above my knees. there's no way i could wear this without unintentionally flashing a few people. sadly this dress will be returned.
other I just received this sweater last week and love it. the material is so much softer and lighter than i expected, but plenty warm. the neck is slightly itchy, but not bad at all. i wore this sweater to church over a navy dress on sunday and received tons of compliments. it is such a unique piece.
3 I ordered the blue stripe and white in size large. i didn't like it worn off shoulder but it does stay in place, which is a good thing. and it looks okay worn on the shoulders. i find the fabric so uncomfortable and itchy that i couldn't wait to take it off, immediately. i tried them on again a second time, still hopeful, with the same outcome. sadly, returning.
other As another reviewer wrote.. this is not the same jean featured on the website. same cut and style but it's a light denim wash with wiskering and worn look at the knees. i called customer service to see if this was a mistake and they said there was not really a way to check it unless i exchanged them. i didnt want the same wrong jeans again so i opted out ... too bad they are cure.
3 I really liked the color and style of this dress, but the proportions were off. the top was too small and the waist was too large. if you are more uniform in size/shape and less of an hourglass this dress may be perfect for you!
other This is a great casual top. it is true to size and a light weight cotton blend. i am an xxsp which fits me perfectly and the tan and white looks crisp and clean. i keep finding myself choosing this top to wear with jeans, cut offs and white shorts. i am frequently chilly, even in the summer and like the long sleeve which i can roll up or keep down. i wish i bought the other two colors before they sold out in my size.
other ... between looking fat and looking like you have a human being on tap (which is way longer than you would imagine). another reviewer mentioned that this makes your boobs look huge when cinched which is true, and also ok since my boobs are huge now. if i wasn't pregnant i'm not sure i would go with this because it definitely has a lot more fabric to it than the model photos make it appear, especially when you cinch. but for 6 months pregnant, this dress made me feel fab.u.lous since it toned dow
other I absolutely love this top! ordered the moss color in size xxs. i am 5'other 10other lbs. i typically wear xs and 0 in retailer clothing. this top is kinda flared/loose fitting so i would size down. the website currently says it's by everleigh but the tag says eri & ali. color is a little darker in person but tie dye effect is spot on. it's beautiful! and super super comfy! i am currently wearing it with my lululemons! but can defin see this top being dressed up with a cute pendant necklace and skinny bla
other Nice sweater. i love the detail in the front. i didn't like that it was lined... it seemed too much like a jacket instead of a sweater to me. nice details on the sleeve but the sleeves are a bit long. i have found many retailer cardigans to be a bit on the small side so i sized up with this sweater.no need to do that. this sweater is true to size.i am usually a large and i felt the xl was too big. it fit like a jacket instead of a sweater. the sleeves are too long for my liking (i like 3/other sle
other The embroidery on this was beautiful but didn't hang well on my athletic/small chested upper body.
other This vest is a really cute idea for layering, so i ordered my usual size medium. and while it fit, it just added about 5-10 pounds onto my frame! ehhh the front just has this extra fabric that you are supposed to bunch up and then tie down, but it just made me look so bulky! sizing down wouldn't have helped as the back would have been squeezed in a small. it's a shame because it seems pretty well made and comfortable too. i'm 5'6", 140, and usually wear a 6 or 8.
other This shirt is so soft and luxuriously feeling. the material looks very nice and seems well made. it has a nice length to it, so it can be worn properly with leggings without any worry. i'm a 36d and can't get the button to close properly, so i'd recommend sizing up if this could be an issue for you. overall it will be a very versitile piece i'm excited to add to my wardrobe.
other Just received this gorgeous blouse and i couldn't be happier! it's stunning! not sheer at all, but light and breezy. i typically wear a medium, sometimes a small, but i ordered the medium since velvet tends to be a little tight in the shoulders on me. this medium is a little roomy so it fits more like a tunic - which is what i've been looking for all spring. the blue is even prettier in person - a true blue. a perfect find!
other I bought the red cardigan because i didn't have anything similar and was so pleasantly surprised by the fit and design that i'm going have to buy it in whatever other colors are available. it's very versatile - looks great tied in front, in back, at the side - and has a tiny bit of flare at the bottom so it's more feminine and flirty than your average cardigan. i have a few tops by this brand and have been really happy with the quality and design.
3 I saw this top in the box and was excited to try it on. the print is absolutely stunning and gorgeous, i could not wait. when i tried it on, it is such a loose top and a tad short. it was flowy all over. i expected it to be loose from the picture but not like this. it would work best on a very slender figure with white pants or leggings. i don't recommend it for a curvy figure, just not flattering. makes everything look big. what a waste because the print is so nice.
other This vest is super cute on. it definitely has kept me warm this winter.
other This dress does run large, but i'm wearing it loose and flowy. bought it for desert trip music festival, with booties and a hat or headband, very hippie chic. my husband thinks it's adorable! the prints are darling.
other I love the fabric, texture mix and length of this top. i gave it a four stars because my usual size is a medium but had to go with a large. a medium felt a bit too snug through the shoulders. very happy with this top and look forward to wearing it a lot.
other These are some of the cutest jeans i've seen in a while. i ordered my usual size 28 and they were too big. i'm 5'9" and about 140 lbs. i always were a 28! i reordered the 27, though, and they fit perfectly. the only disappointment was they make my butt look flat and emphasize my stomach, which isn't the case in other jeans. i think it's due to the high waist. they fit almost like a pair of pants. oh well, i'm keeping them. i tucked in a striped sailor tee and they looked adorable.
other I picked this up unexpectedly and whisked it into the dressing room a long with a handful of other things today.i noticed right away how soft it was! so comfy! i have never owned a romper before so i wasn't expecting to like it--- i was so wrong, i'm sorry romper! i love you!i plan on debuting this little number with a cropped cream cardigan jacket and taupe booties and some layered necklaces for my brother in law's casual weddingrehearsal dinner. living in las vegas though, i can definite
other Very comfy dress that you can wear in the summer if it's not too hot and in the fall/winter with boots (tall or ankle).
other I was so excited to get the dress, it's extremely beautiful and comfortable. the size i picked was unfortunately too big for me though, i just had a baby so it's hard to figure out what size i am now..details were exquisite.
other This top is so much better in person. i do not agree with some of the other reviews about the fabric being scratchy. it is not and i have sensitive skin. i love this top and have got lots of compliments.
other Product was exactly what i wanted. very soft, but very wrinkled upon arrival. will wear it with skinny jeans or even leggings.
other Cute casual drawstring short. runs a little large but nice style for an oversized look. nice length for long legs.
other Love this dress. i'm wearing it as a bridesmaid in a fall, casual outdoor wedding. i think it's fancy enough and can also be dressed down later. i'm 6' tall and skinny, with large breasts and this dress fits. beautiful! not too much cleavage. :)it's not real lace but no one could tell. great quality and nice weight to dress. great for dancing and spinning!
other Material is very soft and the cut is flattering. i got the yellow and pink. yellow is more of a brown color, but i still like it.
other I purchased this dress before reading any of the reviews. i ended up reading them the day the dress was to arrive---and they worried me, since i was so excited for this dress! i put it on and i feel like it is not much different from the photo here online. it is meant to be roomy. it is more fitted on top, and the back is cute to give it some shape too. but it is meant to be loose fitting. i personally love it. i have added a belt to give it more shape when i want, worn it on its own, or with a
other If you like the way this dress looks pictured, you'll love it when it arrives. the patterns and colors are vibrant, the fabric is of high-quality, and the dress is lined with a black slip. for sizing, i"m a size other or other and the xs is a great fit. while i often order petites for dresses - this petite was short enough on me to be mistaken for a tunic. (i'm 5'3).
other Love this shirt! it runs a bit big, i ordered the (petite) other and its a bit long in the sleeves if i don't roll them up, and a bit long and big in the back. but i love the look and it is classic. great with skinny jeans.
other Dolan is my go to for comfy, pretty, practical dresses. i'm 5'0 12other lbs and i consistently wear a petite small in this brand. i bought the taupe - not my favorite color, but i had too many lbds and the green was not a summer color. i chose taupe to wear with my bronze and turquoise jewelry. summer must have.
other This dress is comfortable and cute. i wear xs and this is true to size. the only thing i don't like is the neckline. it is very low cut. will have to wear a cami underneath.
3 I really like this skirt but unfortunately there is no lining, so it's a bit see through under the light. also there is no hook at the top of the zipper to secure the skirt. i just think that with this kind of price, the skirt should come at least with the lining. otherwise, it's beautiful skirt, flowy and very feminine.
other I bought this in the green and i had to try a few to get one that sat well- in fact i tried on a size above my normal size and that particular dress was shorter and tighter than my normal size. when i reordered my normal size, it was a pretty good fit. i kept the dress but am still on the fence on whether or not i should actually keep it- it took so long to find one that fit well that it missed the holiday events where i'd hoped to wear it.
other This dress fits awfully. it's not short, as pictured in photo. it hit just above my knees. it looked like sack. i would've, also, felt like i was choking  all night with it clasped around my neck. it, potentially, may look okay on someone who is very tall, skinny, and lanky, but i have my doubts about that too.
other I wanted to love this top but found it to run small and was too sheer for my taste. it is a beautiful top though, but you will need a cami with it.
other Yeah i know that sounds ridiculous. but this is really a nice piece, the fabric is thin and soft with a little structure to avoid any pajama vibes. the color is perfect, a mid-deep indigo with just enough fading. i don't find it unwieldy or challenging to get on and off, and i like how the fit is adjustable with the waist tie. that said, it does run small. i'm usually a 6/28 and started off with a m. it was pretty form fitting, and the ct risk was at orange level. then the zipper wouldn't stay u
3 Love the style, weight (not too hot) and look but it sheds all over any pants other than jeans. i also wore a white tank under it and it stained it blue. very disappointed
other Really cute dress for work. fits exactly as i expected. this dress is very comfortable and looks put together on days when you're being lazy and just want to "throw something on".
3 I thought this was a sweet design but it is too boxy for me.
other True to size so great fit from top to bottom. i am 5'5'' and it hits my hips at just the right spot - not too high or too low. it also does not flare out too much so it will not give off the impression that you have something to hide in the tummy area. it is very soft and comfortable. the material is not fragile so it should be easy to maintain its shape after washing.
3 I was hoping to wear this dress on my wedding day before the ceremony. i'm 5'5", 130 pounds, usually wear a 6. i ordered this dress in medium and it hangs off of me. it is not straight as it looks on the model, but bells out from the waist. the sleeves are so long that they covered my fingers.
other I was doubtful when i first tried this on. the holding horses brand tends to not quite fit me very well, more so in dresses than tops. also, it looks cute but not great on the hanger. this a must-try-on dress. it's just flowy enough to not look sloppy or maternity, but also feel easy to wear. the print and cut are flattering. it has pockets!!!! also, the length is nice, close to knee length. the fabric is good quality. doesn't wrinkle easily. i'm surprised how quickly i fell in love with this dr
other This dress looked very flattering on me, i say true to size to slightly small. as mentioned in title, the zipper ended up opening in the middle near where the waist is. the lace is soft and fits comfortably, the waist band is the tighter fit. the skirt is less see-through in the store anyway. darker red in person (overall). hoping the one i tired on was a fluke. the skirt has a bit of pleating to it, or atl east it looks like it...regular size hit me below the knee, almost mid-shin, wasn't t
other I love flowy pants like these. pattern looks different, the green is pale, like on the far right. smocking is a beautiful touch and they are a nice weight and well made. had to hem them up about 2" and i'm 5'8", about 180. xl fits perfectly.
other Cut out design, no seems or hems. very disappointed in retailer
other The bottom part of this romper is easy to put on, but the top is very poorly designed. it needs a zipper at the side or less of a yoke along the back. you have to wrangle your limbs in somehow and i was afraid it might tear. once i got it on, it fit perfectly though. getting out of it was a disaster. i had to ask a saleswoman for help and was so afraid it might rip. overall, i was crushed that it didn't work out because the print is super cute and it is very flattering.
other I'm usually a small or medium in retailer tops, however, jackets i tend to wear a small......liking a more fitted look. this jacket i also purchased a small, but there is plenty of room, so might have even worn an xs. anyway, the material is great, is well made, wonderful pocketsi, super comfy, but maybe a little too warm for summer nights. i cuffed up the sleeves......had no issue with the length. i'm 5'6", 36c and i couldn't be happier with this purchase. happy mother's day to me!
3 I wanted to love these, but they're so tight around the top. my legs are normal size and i couldn't get them above my knee. the top isn't stretchy...it has a string that keeps it from expanding. they are so very cute, but unfortunately must go back for me.
other The fabric of this dress is warm, soft, and comfortable. it is versatile and can be worn at both work or out for a casual evening date. it is cute without a belt but, i prefer one just to give it more shape. i plan to wear it often this season. i am 34b/28/37 and purchased a size small.
other This dress was one of those incidental finds i saw in-store while making an online return. for whatever reason i didn't notice this one online but loved it in person. the fit is easy going and flattering, i took a small as the shoulder fit would've been a little tight in the xs. great dress for transitioning seasons :)
other Love this dress so beautiful embroidery is lovely....well worth the price!!!
3 Is a great top for layering over leggings, running errands or after the gym. the material was thin. i returned it because the color didn't look great on me and for the price, i just didn't love it.
other I just got this dress and i love it! it is classic and beautiful. the zipper is tricky right at the band but otherwise no issue there. i cannot wait to wear it.
other I bought the neutral color. this is a lightweight tunic sweater that can be worn during spring. the lace detail is so pretty...i ordered my normal size small and would have preferred an extra small...the top flows nice but would've been a better overall fit if i sized down. i'm 5'7 140 lbs for reference. make sure you size down at least other size.
other I bought this for myself and my mom and we both love it! i got it in a small and almost wish i had gotten it in an xsmall. it's super comfy and appropriate for work.
other I received this today and totally bummed it's not cold enough where i live to where this yet. this style of sweater is what initially hooked me into retailer. it looks like one you'd have up in your closet for years. good quality, feels nice, and i love the detail on the sleeve. kind of wish they'd put a little detail on the back, maybe a peek a boo detail of a small flower or another ladybug but overall i'm very pleased.
other The rocket by citizens of humanity are my favorite jeans. perfect high rise and still makes the butt look good. they are incredibly comfortable. no more hiking up your jeans and bending over. love these so much. am very happy that j brand and citizens are making some good high rises now. won't buy anything else.
other This top is very cute! however, it runs quite large. i ordered my usual size - xs but it looked rather heavy on me. the construction of the top was boxy and didn't produce the same feminine look as it does on the modeled picture. it's a very cute design but i would order a size down for a better fit.
other Absolutely love this dress. it is perfect for the summer. yes it wrinkles but that does not take away from how cute the dress is. the style is so unique, love the pleats. i am 146lbs, 5'6" 36dd and the size 8 fits perfectly. not tight through the arms holes or the bust area. the dress hangs perfectly, you can dress it up or where it to run errands.
other The lokka tunic is a perfect go-to top for casual days or nights! pair it with skinny jeans or leggings and you are set! the long sleeves are fitted and long-so they can be bunched at the wrist. i ordered it in both the black and the the pale grey/blue shade. it is a winner.
other Like other reviewers, found leg more flared/straight than pictured. i wore all day at work (desk job) and didn't see any wrinkling.
other I tried on the regular size at my store (wish stores close to me carried petites), and it was jsut too overwhelming (aka big). i wanted to purcahse the petite, however, as i really like it (striked out as they are sold out in my size, bummer).the cut is otherwise flattering, and the sweater is really comfortable. i like all the contrasting "colors" and patterns too.
other This cardigan is a beautiful - not too thin, but soft and versatile. the cutouts add a nice unique detail. i was worried that the cuts might fray, but they actually have a very thin bit of glue to prevent fraying. really beautiful piece for those of us with cold summer offices :)
other I ordered this shirt in both white and coral. i absolutely love the design and coral color. the white was a bit see through, so i returned it. it would be cute with a cami under, but i just wanted something that did not require an extra layer. overall, it is a flattering fit and i love the detail on the back.
other I originally got these in a 29 petite and thought they fit great right out of the bag (i'm usually a 6/8).. and within an hour of wearing them (to retailer, actually), the knees had gotten so baggy that they looked absolutely ridiculous; i've never had jeans do this. the salesperson at retailer agreed that they seemed very odd. i exchanged for a 28p at her suggestion, and i just hate them. i'd say the smaller size seems every so slightly small, but nothing major - but the waist actually folds over a
other This is a beautiful top. i purchased this in the green/moss color. it's reminds me of a vintage looking blue-green. it fits generously, has more of a swing style to it. i love it! i think it is romantic and feminine. glad i made the purchase. simply beautiful.
other This is a basic henley, and it is made well; a wardrobe staple, for sure. the cut is flattering, and the material is soft. i ordered the small, which is tight fitting. i'm a 3other c for reference.
other I was very excited to receive this dress. i ordered my normal size small, which i should have realized was a mistake. you could fit two of me in that size small. i realize the dress is supposed to be "flowy" but it would have been baggy on me at nine months pregnant. the fabric is soft and comfy and the pattern is cute, but order at least one size down. i'm going to exchange for the xs in hopes of it not resembling a short muumuu.
other Great quality and cut! they are so versatile, which i love! highly recommend these!
other This top is super comfortable and has a great preppy casual look. i have been wearing it on weekends with jeans, but could also pair it with a skirt and tights to have a more work type look. i don't usually like the shorter length shirts, but the fit on this works for me.
other I never buy shorter shorts, my legs are so muscular that most are unflattering, but these were actually ok. they didn't look loose like the model, but hit a nice spot on the leg, and they have enough stretch to fit me nicely. i even bought the white color... unheard of! i weigh 11other lbs, all legs...
other After reading the previous reviews i thought sizing down would be a great idea. as soon as i pulled it out of the bag i knew that the xs/s was still wayyy too big. for reference i am 5'3 and a 34ddd and usually wear an 8 but this thing was enormous. it was shapeless and boxy but done so horribly it looked like i was pregnant. it has an adjustable draw string at the bottom which helps to make you look like a balloon. such a disappointment. the design was lovely and it looked very high quality and
other This ruffle tee is adorable on. the fabric is light but not thin and the styling is very flattering to any figure. i look forward to wearing it as a transition piece as it stays warm long into fall in the south.
other I ordered a size 16 in the orange. it ran a size smaller than normal size 16 maeve tops. the quality of the material was terrible. it wrinkled and was also so thin that you need to wear a tank underneath. that messes with the look of the lace on the top. the color of the orange was gorgeous.
other I love an all cotton shirt! feels great and has a bit of quirky styling without being over the top
other I ordered this dress in the red stripe and i love it. it is casual and easy to wear with flat sandals or booties. the dress is not really sheer like you might think from the picture and it included a nice knit under slip in a pale peachy pink shade that fits true to size as well. the dress has more of a soft woven cotton feel to it. the slip is not really necessary but nice that it is included. i looked at the blue color but it looks more like a tunic in the pictures. i think that the looks are
3 I'm pretty tan and i always have to be careful with white tops or pants. i love the embroidery detail but this top is practically see-through for me. it is double-lined, but i could still see my bra. very pretty though and i was disappointed that it didn't work for me.
other Description is wrong. not a swing tunic. more long and straight. keep that in mind when buying this. if you have hips, this might not be the top for you
other I love this little jean jacket! i am petite and usually get a xxsp , but went for a size up. i'm glad i did. it fits a little snug. the color is true to the photo and the material is a medium to heavy denim. the arm length in the petite size is perfect for me. i love this - over maxi dresses, tanks, etc... adorable jacket - great buy!!
other The sweater is thinner than i expected but very cute so i'm keeping it. it seems well made so i'm not expecting easy snags, it washed well.
other The material and color of the dress were great, but the fit was rather blah. i don't think it was right for my shape. i am disappointed though, i liked design of it.
3 The top is a pretty and has a nice pattern. it does run large and is it a bit billowy. i am 5'other petite and ordered a small ( maybe the xs would have been better). however, the top swallowed me up and was unflattering. the colors are true to the picture..not very bright, but would be a nice transition to fall top.the feel of the blouse was nice and maybe if i was taller and ordered a smaller size it would have been better.
other Smooth to the touch and body skimming, this dress drapes over my figure flaws without drawing attention. it's a great base layer for many accessories and outfits. i love this fabric dolan uses, i already own the sleeveless and cap sleeve versions of this dress. i would love if retailer would sell me a long sleeved maxi or midi version. i'm 135# 38/27/3other and purchased size m regular in green.
other I have been self conscious about a recent weight gain going from a size 6 to a size 10-12, but this dress makes me look & feel skinny again. i know people have suggested that vertical stripes help if you want to elongate your figure. it is true. thanks to this dress i look like my old self, and i am super comfortable wearing this all the time. you can wear this dress from day to night, you can dress this up or down. it looks great with a jean jacket and high-tops, or high-heeled booties with a n
other Pictures do not do this top justice. looks much cuter in person !it caught my eye right away in the store.perfect top for when the weather starts getting a little cooler.
other I bought this very cute t-shirt in sky. wore it once, then washed it according to the washing instuctions (machine washable/dryable). this t-shirt turned into a crop top!!!!! i can't wear it. it's going to goodwill. i would suggest that you air dry this shirt, if you want to take the chance that it won't shrink up several inches.
other I purchased a small in this dress. 5'6" 34d. i could have gone with a medium if i wanted to wear a bra. this dress is not meant to be worn with one. it fit much better without. i liked the regular length as the dress is supposed to be a midi. this dress screams "summer" to me.
3 I was so excited to finally find a work appropriate contemporary pant that i wore them about 3 times in the first week. needless to say they needed to be washed, and i followed the care instructions by washing in cold water and laying flat to dry. after just a single wash in cold water, the pants faded to the point that they looked like they were three years old. so sad, luckily retailer took them back without a problem. be warned, these may need to be dry cleaned which is a lot of maintena
other They fit over my fatty belly and make my legs look good. comfy. nice and not cheezy with a bunch of 'look'. more than i would normally pay, but i like them.
other Now this is a summer staple! love the design of the bib of this tee. super soft, great neutral charcoal color and can be dressed up or down. it is loose, i'd recommend sizing down.
other This is a very pretty sweater, a bit boxy and short but cute. i am 5'1" and ordered the regular xs in black. the thing i did not like about this sweater was the gold thread through the back lace. i would have kept this if it was plain black lace. just did not like that look.
other The fabric is so thin, i think this entire garment might actually fit in a normal-sized letter envelope. the problem is not going to be that the garment is see-through (which it is) - it's the fact that the super thin fabric is not silky, it's cotton-ey, and i suspect it will get "stuck" against the back of my shirt/pants while i'm wearing it and not drape nicely. i wonder if some tiny weights could be sewn to the bottom hem to keep it laying properly.....however, i'm such a sucker for a pre
3 This jacket was too wide and the length in the arms too short. i wear a medium in almost any article of clothing and felt like i was swimming in a short little jacket. the ratio of how wide it is to the length is not for me but might work well with other body types. the arms were definitely too short.
other Over all this is very cute . it is very short. but has very good quality material.
other Great shirt.  love the detail in back.  feminine and different than the average t
other This dress is modern yet timeless, cute yet rock and roll if worn with boots. i am 36b, 26 waist, 36 hips, and size regular s fits well. i like regular size because it is longer in the torso (lengthens waist for a belt) and the length is right above the knees, appropriate for work. the bust area fits me perfectly so well-endowed ladies may want up a size. i am into grey now but all colors are gorgeous, love the sheen, colors are true like shown (other star off for hi price for a simple dress).
other I wanted this this top when i saw it online but was hesitant when i read the review however i went to the store and was able to try it on, good thing. i'm not a fan of the off white/beige material but really like the black style. i had no problem with the shoulders staying down. idid get it in a small a size up for me.
other What a fabulous find! i purchased the grey and it looks great with different shades of blue jeans. i am 5'9" 136lbs and wear a size 6..... 3other c and the medium fits wonderful. was worried it would run short, as i am long waisted, but fits just a bit shorted then pictured. i love tucking the front in and letting the back hang out.
other You can adjust this dress a bit with the straps but it's huge! the colors were also a bit grayish which i didn't expect.
other Love the design of this top. wish i could have gotten it in white but was sold out. it fits nicely overall, but is a little snug in the stomach area. still kept it though, because the shirt is just so pretty!
other The yellow is not as bright as the pic and the tee shirt base color is more off white/oatmeal making the shirt look much more drab in person than in the pics. fit was ok but nothing special about this and will be returning.
other Everything about this top is perfect! quality is great which is number one in my book. color is awesome! perfect color for fall, summer and spring! a must have!!
3 I ordered it in two colors because of excellent reviews. nice material, but fit is not for me. i will be returning them.
other I bought this after eyeing it for months, when it went on sale! the colors are bright and so pretty! the blue very warm, flattering in intensity. this pattern is very unique and the suit is well made. there is some stretch, making it not a chore to pull on.  the bust padding is minimal (like a tshirt bra) best for a & small b cups. no underwire no shaping in cups. the halter has enough room to be comfortable and secure. i felt this fit more like a 0 on the bottom (hips) and a other for top portion,
other I love these tights so much i almost want to buy another few pair and save them for when these wear out. the lining is like clouds on your calves. they're thick enough that you don't need to be totally covered by a tunic but slim enough that they don't add bulk. love, love them!
3 After reading all the reviews, i ordered up a size. the problem isn't that it runs small. it's that they took the bodice of a true size and stuck it on the skirt of a small size. or if you want to think of it differently - the bodice of a large size on to the skirt of a true size. the other top with the 6 bottom would be perfect. unfortunately - you get a size other fitted bodice with a skirt that puckers at the back and shows all your flaws (spare tire) or a size 6 that is atrociously long in the torso
other There was nothing i liked about this coat. it was definitely not designed with a chest in mind. the pins on the straps were already coming off the first time i tried it on. i usually like oranges too, but even this color turned me off.
other Love this dress. sexy but still appropriate. very elegant. i'm 5'6, 12other pounds, and the size other fit me great. it is a little long so i am considering ordering the size other petite. definitely worth the money.
3 It feels soft and like a good quality. however it really does run large and long. i was looking for a loose tank but this one was almost a tunic on my short height and even with a cardigan to give it a shape didn't work out. i also thought it would shrink in the dryer but it didn't. also wrinkles easily.
other This top really pays attention to detail. it is very refreshing to buy a top that is lined so i don;t need to struggle to find the right cami to go underneath. also there is a lovely snap fixture to hold your bra strap in place. very thoughtful :) the top seems to run true to size and fits well. neither the arm holes or the v-neck are too low. i agree with the first reviewer that the main need for sizing up or down is due to breast size. i'm a 36dd and the 10 fit perfectly. also, the colors in t
other I haven't worn this yet, but i can't wait too! i'm 5'3 14other pounds, ordered a size small. it's fits perfect! in fact, it's long enough that i may be able to pull it off as a mini dress on a hot day. that said, i will mostly layer this piece. the ruching on the side flatters the body. i would buy this in more colors if it was available! also, the material is a nice soft quality.
other It is so simple but elegant and beautiful! i am 5'3 and 120 lb and extra small fits me perfectly
other I love this sweater. i purchased it in the red/berry color. it is so incredibly soft and cozy and the fit is fantastic! it hugs my curves in all the right places! i purchased it without even looking at the care instructions. but, after reading a couple of reviews here, i opted to wash on delicate and line dry. it came out perfectly!
other So, i bought these pants in mid-september while at a local retailer store - i thought they were a bit short but the salesgirl assured me they were fine. wore them soon after and then discovered they came in tall sizes as well. anyway, one they came on sale i rebought them nabbing the last tall in my size. while that is a testament for how much i love them - the fit is true to size other than the length issue. i am 5'10" with long legs - the 28t fit me perfectly. of course they cost me more than th
3 Overall the top is cute . what doesn't show in the photo are the pleats on the shoulder/neck area. the placement of the pleats makes you look like you have a football player neck . the neck area doesn't lay flat but comes off as puffy at your neck. i've never seen pleats placed in such a spot. ruined an otherwise cute top
other I like this dress because it's the perfect shape on me and i think the design is modern and cute. i got the red and i really like the pattern and the subtle tulle edging. the material is a little stretchy and substantial and there's also a lining. i wore it with little booties like the model and tights and a cropped moto jacket and loved the outfit. i am short, small chest, but somewhat broad shouldered, the empire waist would not work on larger chested women with hourglass figures.
other The simplicity of this t-shirt will go with jeans, shorts, or anything casual. the macrame and bead details give it that extra style. i bought the red and white, and love them both. the red is warm and bright, with pink undertones. despite the boxiness of the fit, it ran true to size for me. i did not think it was too big; its meant to be loose and slouchy rather than fitted.
3 Bells out to much i had to send it back
other This top is really cute, but the threads underneath the shirt scratch your torso. i suggest wearing a tank underneath to protect your skin.
other Loved the dress, but the white of the dress was neon white, way too bright and made it look terrible against my skin. i can imagine this looking good on someone with darker skin. but i"m my pale skin it looked bad. otherwise the fit was great, besides missing out on the petite sizes which are sold out.
other I bought this during a 20% off sale which made it even more worth the price. i would have purchased and kept it regardless, but just got lucky.looking at the pictures online, i thought the coat was going to be red. however; when it showed up it is more purple. i still like the color and did end up keeping the coat.i do think the buttons are sewn on well, but i was surprised it did not come with additional buttons in case one gets lost. these are very unique buttons so i can't imagine it woul
other I love this dress so much that i purchased it in both grey and wine. i find the cut very flattering and slimming, and love the pockets. it works great for northern california winters, with tights, boots, boiled wool sweatercoat over it while outdoors, and on its own indoors. i wish there was a long-sleeved version. i feel exceptionally cute and cozy while wearing it. good job, sparrow! btw, i bought the other currently offered sparrow wool dress (the mock-neck dress), and this one is just an inc
other I would buy these pajamas in every color if offered. they feel wonderful to the touch and even better on!
other I was surprised to find this jacket on sale and i don't mind :) it's a trend of the season and i absolutely don't mind to look like a mattress or wear robe. the garment runs large so i wear usually 6 and have to get xs. i am 5'6" 146 lbs usually wear s/m in jackets. it hits me other inches below my knee. i love it.
other Beautiful and different material, like it a lot. very happy with the purchase.
other Great dress, comfortable to wear and flattering, with the stretch cinch waist and the soft flare of the skirt i feel flirty and fun with its open scoop neck and dipping back. plenty of space and simplicity to accessorize or not. i bought it in black/white and red, each with its own feel.
other This is a really cute skirt, and it seems well-made (good stitch-work and enough weight to the fabric that i'm not worried about underwear show-through but not too heavy for a summer skirt). i sized up from an 8 to a 10 because it was difficult to get the skirt over my bum. also, the zipper doesn't lay flat when i have it in the back of the skirt so i just shifted it to the side--still looks great imo. i think if you have hips or a booty you might want to size up on this skirt. color is true to
other Bought the gray and peach in the store and loved it so much ordered the other colors online. this top is very comfortable and stylish. it stands out from the crowd as just enough different to be very unique and trendy but still a classic look. the sweater front is very soft and the back has a bit of a silk feel but not sheer. i also like that the back is a bit longer than the front.
3 I was searching for the perfect large comfy sweater for the cold winter weather ahead and i thought this would be it. it looks so cute in the pictures but when i received in by mail it wasn't what i was searching for. this sweater, like on the model, is quite large. although i wanted a large sweater, the fit of this one didn't fit well on me. it has more of a boxy feel to it. i usually wear a medium, but went with a small because i expected this to fit a little large and it still engulfed me. i
other I bought a size 8 a few years back not my regular size but when used it tend to sag. so this time i bought a size 6 my regular size.
3 I was so excited for this romper, but was disappointed after trying it on. the material felt cheap for the price, and it runs quite small. will be returning. :(
3 Love the color, but the fit is just odd and frumpy. the sleeves are shorter than the should be. when i lift my arms, the entire sweater gets lifted. going back.
other I actually paid full price for this over the winter and i'm not sorry i did. great top w/lovely fabric. i usually wear a small but in this top, an xs, so it runs a bit large.
other I bought this dress in the green. it runs big - i usually take a s and had to return for xs - i am 5'5" and 125. it flows beautifully and can be dressed up with heels or worn completely casual with flip flops. worth every penny!!
other Love this blouse! the top is true to size...i'm generally a m and decided to try a pl which fit great. the pm was just a bit snug...looked fine but i felt a little constricted in the bust area and thought the pl was better for me. i'm 5'1" for reference and curvier on top than on bottom. i wore a nude bra when trying on and it totally worked with this blouse. the lace detail is a bit sheer in some parts near the bust line but nothing too inappropriate. i can't wait to wear it down to dinner for
other The color is as pictured. good quality. it's lined. the zipper in the back makes it look updated. i ordered my usual size. small petite size 6. it fit perfectly. i'm other feet and 120 lbs. hourglass figure. i had high hopes. i have hips and short, heavy legs. the skirt only emphasized my flaws. if you've got great legs you will do well with this. i do own other short skirts. but the fact that is less tailored in look makes it better suited for a younger gal. if you're on the fence give it a try. it
other I'm usually a maeve fan. i found this top to look cheap and fit poorly. it is also very thin material and showed everything.
other This blouse is a great combination of silky and professional in the front and more casual, t-shirt like in the back. the ruffle lies nicely, and it's very feminine. i got the light blue color, and can't wait for the weather to be warm enough to wear this to work!
other I love this peasant top! i didn't expect it to be made from such nice fabric. usually, i have to wear a camisole under a lot of retailer tops, but not this one! i bought a petite xs and if fits perfectly. thank you to retailer for selling petite clothes.
other I was a little hesitant to order this dress due to the cotton/polyester blend...not generally a fan of poly for summer. it is high quality though, very soft, lightweight and lays beautifully. it's not see through either, which seems like a rare find in clothing lately. the embroidery is very well done too, and i think it adds just the right touch of feminine, while not being overly "precious". it does run small by a whole size, which i've found to be typical of eva franco dresses. i am usually a
other I found this skirt ran very small and i had to go up a size from what i usually wear. maybe it is meant to be worn really tight as the fabric seems to contain a lot of spandex. i really like the longer length. it feels like a good sturdy fabric. i haven't washed it yet, but i'm hoping it doesn't fade or shrink.
other I had high hopes for this top but it didn't work for me at all. it shows your bra straps perfectly. plus, it was so big and boxy that it made me look about 10 pounds heavier. no thanks!
other This an absolutely beautiful quality stylish coat but through no fault of the coat, i had to return it because i looked like a bear in it. i'm too short and too round around the middle for this type check and this type material. i wouldn't want to discourage anyone from trying it.
other When you look at the online pictures of the navy colored dress, the stripes are diagonal. however, that is not the case with the dress in person. the stripes are all horizontal and not that flattering. such a bummer because i love maeve dresses and thought this would be a great addition to my summer dress rotation. alas, not very flattering, so back it goes.
other I bought this dress for my wedding rehearsal dinner. it's beautiful. the material is thicker than i imagined, not a bad thing at all. i ironed it with lots of steam and it came out great. the tie in back is nice because it can be cinched tight or worn more loosely
other This dress references that it is off the shoulder in the description. but i did not find it to be so; it fits me as pictured on the model - sort of a ballet neck or wide scoop neck. in any case, the fabric is as pictured. and - it's lined! yay - not see through. the varying sizes of stripes give it interest despite the neutral colors. it is cute with a denim jacket and is really comfortable.
other It is beautiful, but not practical for me - the student who carries a backpack ! i didn't notice it doesn't have sleeves, it is regular poncho, soft and stylish . recommended for poncho lovers !
other Love this! ordered it on sale, but i really do think it's worth full price! i went with a small even though an extra small would have been good too...i'm slender and 5'9" about 125# with full bust. the small fits similar to the model, and because i wanted it to fit well in the sleeves (i have long arms!) and length, i went with the small. maybe should have gone smaller as it is roomy! it's very well made and although you'll need a cami, i still feel as if it will be very cozy. perfect for our mi
other I fell in love with this dress when i saw it. i am usually a petite, so i knew it would hit me just above the ankle, but it works! what is lacking from the description is the under slip that comes with the dress. it is a knee length, cotton jersey slip that is bulky and uncomfortable - thus the other star rating instead of other star. i won't use the slip, so this makes the dress fairly sheer when backlit. otherwise, the dress is well made and the addition of the piping at the seams makes it special. i
3 I bought this sweater online and was surprised by how thick and fluffy it is. this is a warm and cozy sweater, more bulky than oversized. pattern has a comic book-style art look. it has raglan sleeves and a boxy cut and narrows a bit at the waist. cute, warm sweater for winter--wore with an undershirt.
other Love this suit. i ordered up a size on the bottoms, and am so glad i did. the style fits true to size, is beautiful, and vibrant. i thought it looked like ribbing vertically, but it is just part of the design. it is not padded at all, but is thick enough to be seamless.
other I love the design of this sweater...shorter length, with shorter sleeves.goes great with jeans and has a very different look!
other Woah, these jeans looked ridiculous on me. i felt as though it was 1987 and i was raiding my mom's closet. the combination of the light wash, the crop leg and high waist with the odd stitching around the midsection make this a no. it really accentuates any pouch you may have. i was looking for a high waisted denim but these are very unflattering. i am 5'3" / 140 curvy. no, no, no!
other I normally wear an xl, but could only find this instore in size large. the blouse fits nicely, but i think it would come down a bit lower and also be a longer blouse if i would have purchased it in my usual size. the blouse itself has a nice drape to it. the black 'railroad tracks' look very pretty in person, and add a nice detail. the only complaint i have with this blouse is the sleeves. the enormous bell sleeve feels like a costume. but for a nominal fee i had the sleeves shortened to a ruffl
other I got this tank because it was on sale, thinking it could be cute, but i didn't have high hopes. once i put it on, i loved it. i have a long torso and it's the perfect length. i have worn it with a jacket over it also to extend its life into cooler weather.
other Love this top! super comfortable, great fit, and really pretty colors. probably going to buy it in multiple colors it fits so great.
other Beautiful skirt! dress up or down! colors are lovely and enable one to wear many different tops. lightweight. perfect for casual or summertime work.
other Love the top, but very small to the size. ordered a medium and had to send back in exchange for x-large.
other When i saw this online, it looked like a regular cardigan with a hood, but with looser arms and a generally looser fit. just be aware it has bat wings or something (not sure what it is called). there isn't one picture included with an arm lifted, so without a really close look, the arms look loose, but normal. i returned it :(
other Love this poncho - plan to take it to europe this fall. warm and cozy yet not constricting. great neutral color!
3 Not up to retailer standards! fabric quite thin(you could see nude-color bra through the white one) and thin fabric, wide bottom hung sloppy; no way i would feel "well dressed" in this top. i returned it.
3 I really want to like this dress - it's beautiful, but it just fits like a sack. the yoke exaggerates my bust and the dress makes me look 20 lbs heavier. perhaps if you are tall and thin like the mode, or small chested, it would be great! the quality and color is beautiful.
3 I nearly always wear a size small, and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this, and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.
other Wore this to work and nearly everyone complimented me on it. very comfortable. lots of detailing. perfect for fall. pockets! i'm usually somewhere between a s and m but this piece was generously cut and a s was perfect. i debated ordering the petite, but actually the regular cut was the perfect length even though i'm only 5'4".
other Good quality jeans, but had to return, as they did not fit my curvy hips.
other Runs a bit small. very slimming. love these. when will they be available in moss again?
other I fell in love with this in the store. i am petite at 5'3" and 110 lbs and i went with the regular size 0. i agree with another reviewer that the petite sizing would have been too short. the color is rich, the quality is fabulous and i love the style. it is not fitted, but i also found that it wasn't too wide either. if you're looking for a fitted top, this wouldn't be the one. but if you love a well-styled top with a bit of volume that you can rock with a pair of skinnies to balance it out, the
other Beautiful fall/winter piece! so soft and comfy!! was unsure about it when i saw it online but once i saw it in store and got to try it on and feel it i could not put it down! i felt you could definitely size down!
other Looking forward to wearing this on a beach holiday !
other This is a perfect top for warm weather. and depending on the accessories you pair it with, it can be great to wear while running errands or for a casual date. the woven texture at the back is unique and gives it the retailer vibe we all know and love. definitely runs big but that's part of the charm of the top.
other Love this dress.  wear it with sneakers or boots.  can add a belt, or the right accessories to dress it up.
3 ...the print is so sharking, and i love the way it looks on the model -- but i'm a more curvy figure, and the boxy-ish cut plus rather stuff fabric in front is incredibly unflattering. ordinarily i love everything made by maeve, but this one sadly must be returned... on a thinner/straighter-shaped person i expect it would be great.
other I ordered this online, but i own the vest and i love it, so i took a chance. this is a super comfy, great quality jacket. the sleeves are some kind of knit material and that makes it really cozy and not constrictive. the color, i ordered the green, is perfect. i ultimately returned the jacket because i thought the lapels were just too wide for my liking. they look exactly like the picture so if you don't mind that, you will probably be very happy with this jacket. it just wasn't for me. i ended
3 I was excited to nab this lovely because i am a sucker for a faux layered look. i am usually an xs or s, depending on the designer so i went with xs in this top based on reviews that it doesn't drape well. i barely got my arms into the sleeves. i thought maybe it was a mistake and i received a child's size?  i eventually did get it on but barely got it back off. size up 1-other for comfort if you have to have this girl. i was bummed my local retailer did not have a m for me to try. returned.  for ref:
other I was leary about ordering this but absolutely loved it when it arrived!  i found out the front could be the back and the back could be the front - reversible, right?  and the styling of the shirt was very complimentary to my body.
other I think this is a really flattering dress. i like the length of the sleeves (they're not long like in retailer's very first navy photo but all the other pics are accurate in my opinion.) in my photo, i'm wearing an xs regular so i'd say it's shorter than 35" because i'm only 5'3" and it's above my knee. it may run slightly small because i'm a 34aa, with a 26" waist, 34" hips and usually wear xspetite in retailer but this xs fits me fine (although to get it to be fitted at the waist, xxs might be bet
other This top would have been better if it had a stretchy  fabric. being large breasted makes this top a little tight. still so pretty so i'm keeping it. makes me look a little less chesty.
3 I wanted to love this skirt. i love high-waisted skirts and the length seemed flattering on the model; it was not so flattering on me. the fabric is so lovely--truly the photos online don't do it justice. it's heavy and luxurious, wonderful for fall or winter, and the gold, gray, and navy floral pattern is not too flashy or bold. plus, pockets! however, the midi length did not work for me, despite the product's suggestion that it was a universally flattering length, just above the knee. i'm not
other This dress is beautiful. it was on back order and i waited about three weeks to receive it. i usually wear a size 8 in retailer but because it was a button down dress, i ordered a size 10. the bottom is a great fit but the top is difficult to button. it is a heavier weight so i feel it is better for the spring than the summer season.
other Similar to the previous reviewer, i'm also between sizes and for pencil skirts it's usually the larger size that end up fitting. whether this skirt runs large or maybe because it has a slight stretch, my smaller size (10) fits perfectly and seems comfortable enough to wear on a long flight or road trip. the fabric is wonderful, the skirt length is great for work, and the styling is really nice with added detail of buttoned loops at the waist. if i had one negative comment it would be an itty bit
other Very cute everyday tee. usually run between an xs or small with retailer and was happy i chose the extra small. a great updated on a classic strip tee.
other For reference: 5'3, 130#, athletic/muscular body type (broad shoulders, slim hips)i wanted to love this dress soooo much, i wanted it for holidays, and special occasions, but my broad shoulders and 34d chest worked against me. the criss-crossed bodice accentuated my larger top, and there wasn't enough poof in the skirt to balance me out. i'm sure this will work beautifully on other body types, and i wish it worked on mine too! a sparkly necklace or dangling earrings and a high bun are all you
other I just received this in the mail and really enjoy it! it's a nice color and very gauzy/ airy. the only think i didn't love is that it's a little bit in the chest area, which is rare considering i'm usually a m in that area.
other I really wanted to like this since i've purchased previous byron lars dresses and have never not been complimented on them. however, the picture on this one is misleading. the colors are extremely bright, which on my pale skin makes me look washed out. for example, the border on the collar is actually more hot pink where in the picture here it appears almost white. the brightness and business just didn't work on me. that being said it still fit like a glove. 5'1other and 14other pounds and the size other wa
other Im so glad this shirt came to me just as pictured and described. color and fit was spot on! thank you!
other When i first saw this shirt in person i was shocked because the lines on it are sparkly and colorful.  now that i look closely at the shirt online i see that, but i did not expect it cause it wasn't as obvious in the online photos.  it is much more prominent in person.i ordered it in my usual size and it fits perfectly - just like the model, definitely oversized but appropriately so.  the length was also great (i'm 5'8) which made me very happy.
other Nice quality, definitely need to wear a tank top or camisole cause this doesn't come with it. color is great not too bright. true to size. if you want short length zed a petite size.
other There is so much i love about this dress. like many of the other reviewers i simply love the fabric. it's soft and comfy but has texture and interest at the same time. there's beautiful detail to it as well. the edging at the neckline and hemline are unfinished and beautifully so. having said all that, i like many other reviewers i just don't have the body type to pull it off. there wasn't one angle that didn't make me look even bigger than i am. the pleating in the front, while very cute, gave
other This dress makes me so sad...the textured stretchy fabric, color, length, and overall swingy fit are spot on. as another reviewer noted though, the armholes and neck totally ruin the dress. the neck is tiny, which i could have gotten over once it was on, but the arm holes were just awful - too big all around (too tall of a cut plus too wide of a cut). basically, you could see my bra plus from the front there was unflattering exposure near the armholes. it could have been so good, but alas, but t
other I'm 5'5, 145lbs and i'm usually a small/medium depending on the vendor. i bought this shirt in a red, medium and love it. yes, it's boxy and a little big but lays nicely and i think it's meant to be a bit big. i've worn a black cami underneath and the shoulder hangs off a little to the side giving a little extra sexy look to it. this shirt washes well per instructions, didn't shrink or loose it's shape and i've washed it three times now. i've had many compliments on how cute this shirt is, love
other I love the crisscross detail that makes this a stylish and also flattering piece. lovely soft material that drapes well and hides imperfections. wish it came in more colors!
other Imo this top does run small. arms were tight in the size xs and just a bit snug in the s. top is definitely versatile. i don't usually wear peplum tops due a larger chest (34d-dd) and they usually look like maternity tops on me, however this one did not. the problem with this top is the fabric in the back of the top is shearer than i'd like. you can see every bulge and bump of your bra. i felt you'd need to cover your back with either long hair, jacket, vest or cardigan. not a deal breaker becau
other Love love love this dress! but, if you are not wearing a slip...you should be! please wear a slip, you can see right through this dress.
other Love my mother jeans and these are super cute for spring! they fit tts. i'm 5'7 and i bought my normal 25.
other I bought this at the store and when i picked it up i didn't think much of it until i tried it on! it is so adorable, i can't even tell you how much... i am 48 yo and normaly buy xs/s or 2/other in retailer. mauve dresses are other most of the time. small chest, 5'5" and about 130lbs and i got the size other and it is perfect! i hope it is age appropriate tho... ;) i have traveling plans this summer and i am thinking this could be an easy thing to take along with me, one piece clothing that will travel very we
other Oh such a classic retailer look for summer! a vintage pattern on a crisp cotton fabric. i was immediately drawn to it. but wait- there is a sort of wrap around tie at the waist, creating the look of an apron. yes. it looks like one is wearing a full apron. or scrub dress. why?? this would have been sooo much better as a simple shift or a skirt/blouse combo.
other I waited three months for these pants. when they finally arrived, i was mostly pleased. they seemed like the staple pant everyone is raving about. and they should have been.problem one: they bag out. i got one wear out of them before i needed to wash and hang to dry (regained shape then).problem two: the crotch split! in the front! i'm a teacher. i sincerely hope no one noticed! i read other reviews about this problem and don't know if i got a bad batch or if a similar fate is awaiting other
other It is an expensive panty, but so worth the money! it is so unique and flattering!
other This is a cute waffle t-shirt material is very thin and see-through it's a cute shape and style but it runs absolutely huge  is not a shirt for petite people the extra extra small was huge
3 Unfortunately i didnt read the fine print when i ordered this re: dry cleaning only, but this in itself wasnt a total deal breaker. it did fit well -- i am 5'2, 32c, 107 lb and the xs petite fit very well, definitely form-fitting, not long in the arms or waist. the grey heather design was not my favorite look, actually thats the main reason i am returning it -- there was a dark grey splotch of the heathered design on the chest, and it looked like i had a huge dark stain.
3 The top falls nicely, great quality, the lace is beautiful. however, the sleeves are too wide and puffy. the top is voluminous and i wished it had more form fitting sleeves to balance this out. the top does not look flattering on me so i will be returning it.
other I have these pants in a larger size, but recently lost some weight and wanted a smaller size.they are so comfortable and soft and go with everything.keep in mind that they run a little large and do stretch a bit once you wear them.just wish they would be available in tall!!!
other I am now on my third pair of these pilcro hyphen chinos...they fit my body type well, which is pear-shaped. they are super comfy, relaxed, and my go to pant. i love that they are a pop of color with what i am wearing vs just a normal jean. i can't say enough about these pants...
3 Ahhh, i should have listened to previous reviews. indeed, this top runs very large. style wise, it is ok. i would say you could do much better at retailer.
other I bought this for the office and received many compliments about it. it puts the outfit together just right and the material is very comfortable. it fits my need for comfortable clothing that still looks good enough for a business setting. this jacket is more comfortable (almost slouchy) than it is structured.
other The fabric is very nice on this wrap, but it wears like a blanket.
other Lovely sweater. it fits baggy and form fitted somehow. i like the multi-fabric look. however, the main body of the sweater does shed!!! like, i just held it up to my body to look at it in the mirror and the shirt i had on was covered. haven't washed it yet, so can't speck to that, but i'm guessing it will lose some of that in the wash.
other I had high hopes with the other good reviews, but you just don't know how amazing this is until you put it on! just so soft and cozy! i am so excited for more saturday/sunday products at retailer!
other Beautiful dress that is very flattering! wearing it to my bridal shower.  more appropriate for spring or summer!
other These jeans are so comfortable and do not stretch out enough to size down, in my opinion. right when i put them on i could tell they fit perfectly. i have been buying pilcros for several years and have not been happy with the stet ankle jeans from the last other yrs because although they were very flattering when you first put them on, they stretched out so much it was annoying. these script jeans are amazing, flattering and are a nice lightweight denim. i wore them a few times before washing and
other I have been searching for these pants my whole life. i have them in several colors. i wear the moss most often. i'd recommend your normal size or size down if in between sizes. they stretch a bit as you wear them. one other thing- after being washed and dried the color has lightened significantly.
other These pilcro jeans are so very cute. i usually wait for a sale to purchase the pilco jeans, but i didn't want to chance them not being available in my size. the pilco jeans seems to sell out fast. the cotton material is very soft but not sloppy. you will love the embroidery down the side of the leg. they do run a bit big. i purchased them in one size smaller for a slimmer fit. i would suggest one size up if you like them more baggy.
other Just a cute, casual tee that i grabbed on sale, but i love the bow in the back! something unique for an otherwise plain tee!
other I debated buying this, so glad i did. tts. i'm 5'5" 11other and 32c. i got size 2, and it worked but i could have done a 0 (which is my usual size). i was afraid to order it too small because i needed it right away! this dress is gorgeous! i got the pink color way and it is more vibrant in person. the beading is beautiful, it's incredibly soft and flowy! this dress is probably my favorite dress ever! if you're on the fence, order it!
other The style and color is very nice but the fabric is a bit stiff. the fabric doesn't have much give and isn't as comfortable as most of my other retailer t shirts. still a cute top for the cooler weather.
other This dress is well made, great fit, perfect a-line. the bust was lower cut than shown in the picture, but it fits well even with a large chest. completely flattering and i would highly recommend!
other This sweater is of nice quality and has such great detail to it - love the pattern to the knit and the ribbon detail is unique and beautiful. the knit itself is of mid to thicker weight, so definitely appropriate for winter, fall, and cooler spring days. i bought my normal size small and felt like it had more of a slub fit than pictured in the model shot - it was wider down the torso and a little shorter (not tunic length like picture). i'm 5'7" with a longer torso and this hit maybe mid-bum and
other I tried this on as a fluke.  i work at retailer and like to see the fit of everything so i can talk about it with customers.  it is so chic!  it makes your butt look amazing!  i tried it on with nude booties, but i could also see it with a great heeled sandal, or flats.  don't overlook this beauty!!
other I am very happy with my purchase. it is a great sweater! very easy to wear and cute! i am very sensitive to scratchy wool products and this one is very soft. i highly recommend it.
other I was so excited to receive this dress only to come find out that it was not tweed, not the same colors as the picture, spandex material, the fit runs smaller than most of their dresses and the sleeves are capped. i love retailer and prefer their clothes above all other brands but i was extremely disappointed in this dress.
3 Like the color and romper style. this runs extremely large. i am normally a petite small and it was too large. with the wide- leg style and overall length you may need to alter this piece.
other I love this suit. it is a really cute color way & stripe and the fabric is nice, but... i ordered an xl. i have 20-30 extra pounds on me leftover from my last child. i am currently wearing a 10 or a 12. this suit would be great for a thinner girl, but i could not wear this suit to the family pool. the bottom is cut kind of skimpy and the breast area does not have much support. this xl would be a better fit on an 8-10. it will need to go back.
3 I was disappointed with this jumpsuit. when i first saw it in the store, i thought i was going to love it. when i tried it on, the first issue is the fabric is too sheer. i could completely see the outline of my underwear and bra. it also runs way too big! i know the bottom is supposed to be loose and flowy, but the waist needs to be more tapered to off set that, and it's so baggy. the arm holes are also cut very low, so when you lift your arms you can see most of your bra on the sides i wante
other I bought this dress to wear to work in my second trimester. the shape is perfect to accommodate a baby bump while still flattering the top. definitely recommend for any pregnant women trying to avoid true maternity clothes!
other I'm 5'other and 12other and the 28 fit comfortably. i initially bought the 27 but felt it was snug in the seat so switched out for the 28, i'm 5other so didn't want the painted on look. they will need to be washed more frequently since they do stretch out as they are worn. love the gray color and goes with so many fall colors.
other I'm only 5'3" so i ordered a small but i have a larger rear (size 4-6) end and bust (32dd). the small gave me plenty of room in the top. the bottom area was definitely meant for someone with a smaller butt but i don't feel over exposed or anything. the fabric on the bottom is thick which is really nice. it makes the body seem slim and keeps the white from being see through even when wet. the long sleeve design is also awesome! i have gotten numerous compliments on it. the top has an inner liner
other Loved this sweater wrap and bought it in both colors. very light weight and i will get lots of use out of this. i wish retailer would have more pieces like this. a+
other A scandalous mini skirt that isn't a skirt! beautiful pattern. does run a little big.
other It's easy to miss the fine details that make this top special.the fabric inset around the collar & front placket is an abstract blossoming spring branch print overlaid with 3d decorative embroidery and clear sequins & is trimmed with a delicate lace. the sequins are eye-catching in a very subtle, shimmery way.beautiful under a sweater, love the top's double layer look, fits tts, not too sheer. you might have to wear a strapless bra or do without one altogether because of the neckline and
other Tried this on a whim in store, and it might not look like much on the hanger, but this beauty fits perfectly and is quite flattering! it is loose without being billowy (still has nice tailoring for shape), the fabric is light but good quality, and the pattern is super cute. i was shocked when i saw that the price was much lower than expected - this is a true win, even at full price. for reference, i'm 5'7" 128lbs and took my usual size s.
other I loved the cut and the stretch in the material made them comfortable, however i found that the material was unflattering for thicker thighs because it tended to cling to the body. it would have been better with some sort of lining as it would have prevented the flimsy material from highlighting imperfections. bottom of pants are not hemmed, so if you want a clean look, you may not like the edges. these were returned immediately as it just did not work for me.
other So.. i saw this dress like a month ago and i fell in love. utter i-have-to-have-it love. before dropping $200 superfast, i gave myself some time to think it over. well, of course i decided to order it, and of course my size was sold out. most of the sizes were sold out, actually. they did have a petite left, so after i dried my eyes, i decided to wing it. the petite actually fit. the mid section is a little snugger than i am normally comfortable with (although the top is so structured that it ac
other I really really like this tunic. it is gorgeous! but it runs small. i tried in l, usually wear l/xl, i may need to try the xl. but i sent it back because it just too expensive. the fabric itself is thick and heavy. i didn't like the fabric much, i wish it were softer. especially for such a gorgeous tunic. it was hard to send it back, but i may try the larger size in the store. i think i need other sizes up, it runs too small.
other I love everything about this vest! comfortable and cute, great transition piece into spring.
other I would highly recommend this top. i usually wear a small petite. but returned the top for an xs petite which fit perfectly. there is a lot of fabric, but if you size down it wasn't an issue for me. i weigh 120lbs and am other feet tall. also, i'm busty, 3other d. which worried me with this type of top. not a problem. i will wear a blazer or leather short jacket with this. i am very picky and i was happy with the quality. the fabric is not heavy. it's a fantastic purchase!
other I loved the layered look without all the bulk. the different textures make it so interesting.
other At 46 years old, i still like fun, hip, fashionable items, but i don't want to look like i raided my 2other year old daughter's closet. this jacket hits the mark perfectly. it looks great layered over a casual dress or with skinny jeans and a wedge. the embroidery and the back tie soften the masculine color and shape. i'll be wearing this often!
other I tried this on in the store in a regular medium and the size was fine, just the length. fortunately retailer will ship for free if you need a petite! i'm so excited to get this. i'm 5'other and a bit busty, and the medium fit perfect. its very flattering and so comfortable! perfect for a hot summer day. or as the cute clerk in the store had it styled with a cropped jean jacket and a fun necklace. the styling idea's are endless. i'm waiting by the mailbox for it to arrive!
other I never would have thought to choose this, but an retailer associate suggested the black sweater as a topper while i was trying on the camellia dropwaist dress, and it made a sale, i bought them both! the sweater, while not decked with beads or embroidery, adds an incredible definition to any outfit that is overly flowy. i would say the photo above showing the grey sweater says it all. usually a size 6 in retailer dresses, the small fit well. i appreciate the cotton fiber content, as well as the ver
other I wanted to love this sweater but it is a return. it is a very weird fit, very thick, rug-like material and unfitted. the shoulders are bulky, the top is big and the booty is small. i am 5'2", 34c and typically wear a small. the arms were very long, way too long. i will say other than that the top was true to size, may look okay on someone who had a larger chest and a smaller bum!
other I'm 5"5' and 12other lbs. i ordered the s petite to make sure the length wasn't too long. i typically wear an xs regular in retailer dresses. if you're less busty (34b cup or smaller), a s petite will fit you perfectly (snug, but not tight). i love that i could dress it up for a party, or down for work. i love that the tulle is longer then the fabric underneath.
other The print, length and cut are all flattering. i bought the other tiny dress that was similar and will buy every pattern they make.
other Purchased this in green and love the color. it drapes well - not too long on me and hung just past my hips. it has very thin sleeves as other review mentioned to cannot wear anything bulky underneath. overall very happy with this purchase.
other I love this robe and can't wait to wear it while i'm getting ready for my upcoming wedding. the only con that i can see is that the sleeves are a bit baggy, but other than that it's perfect!
other This product fit well and was soft and beautifully made.
other This one is way better in person. admittedly, i put it in my basket only becasue it was on the stylists picks...well, it is great. a little sheer, adn super static-y when i received it, but oh so soft. the plunge is a tiny bit low for my liking, but this doe'n'tt come in petites,so i had to suck it up and keep the regular sie. teh coloring is nice too, neutral, event htough there is rust and navy and greay-ish, it stil lcan be worn with anything..
other This sweater is actually so cute on, i had no idea, nut decided to try it on, since it was on sale. what a msitake, i had to actually buy it!the grey part is very soft and warm, the design part is nice andflattering. nothing wrong with this sweeater!note: i a,m petite (other foot 1.other inches) and decided to buy the regular size for longer length...
other I love sweaters like this. it's perfect over a tank top for a casual every day look. it's soft, comfy, and i love the length. one more thing i like is that while it looks great just open, there is a snap to fasten it if you want to.
other I had been searching for a swimsuit that flattered my baby bump and this is it - i'm in love! for reference, i am 5'6",170-180, 10-1other or m-l depending on the item. however, i'm currently 19 weeks pregnant so im about 18other and growing - so i went with the xl swimsuit. i have a 36c/38d bust and although there is no true support in the top of this suit, it holds the girls in and the deep plunge is just the right amount of sexy. the bottom has modest coverage, showing just a little bit of cheek. i go
other I love this jacket. i'm 6' tall, 160lbs, 30" waist and a 34d. i normally go for an 8/medium and i bought a medium. i love it! slightly cropped, barely snug fit but i can still snap it closed. totally warm enough for california fall/winter. i like that the sleeves don't have sherpa in them... make it easier to layer! i bought the "silver" corduroy and it's less white than the photos, but it still fits the bill perfectly. love that it's machine washable, too. it also has pockets!
other This is a great basic tee (purchased in navy) but fits much larger than it appears on the model. the arms/chest area fit fine but it really billows out below. the front is shorter and the back is longer than i would've expected. i thought this would be great for summer, but it's really too long in the back to wear with shorts. it does, however, look great with skinny jeans.
3 I wish these zipped up instead of the drawstring. they are super cute but don't care for the way they sit on the hips.
3 For the price of this tee the beautiful front lattice work should have been extended onto the back. would have been a classier, more finished looking garment. if the cost is not an issue then this tee makes a nice neutral addition to a neat but casual summer look.
other This dress looked nice online so i ordered it. once it arrived i tried it on and it looked even better. the fit was flattering as well. very versatile piece in an interesting print. glad i caught this piece on sale!
other First off, let me say that i am 5other and don't often go for print jeans these days:) however, these are just so stinking fun and flattering that i couldn't say no. these look great cuffed for warmer temps, and rolled to full length will be fun to wear with fall sweaters. if you are looking for something fun and flattering, these are the ticket! i bought the grey version and feel that they will work with many pieces that i already have.
3 This is a cute dress but the fabric is very heavy and i didn't find it to drape well on me. it is a very heavy felted poly type of fabric. i ordered it for a specific event coming up this summer and the fabric will not work for warm temps. the style and design of the dress is great though. for reference it did fit fairly true to size. i wear a 0 or 2. the xs fit well. if the fabric works for your situation then i would try this dress.
other I usually wear xl in tops at retailer, but i picked this one up in a l. it's stretchy and super soft, but doesn't breathe all that well.
other I love this skirt! it is unique and flattering clothes like this skirt, that brought me to retailer in the first place. as the first reviewer said, this is a well-made striking skirt. it is tts (i usually wear a size other - and the size other fit perfectly; i am 36-17-36, and 12other lbs, 5'4".) the skirt is lined and is very comfortable to wear.
other I love these tees, i ordered other of the map shirt. they are comfortable and stylish. i knew that i would wear it so much, so i bought a spare.
other The dress is too loose and runs too big
3 I like the idea of the pullover. the quality of is nice; the material is very soft and feels pleasant to the touch.i expected this sweater to be more flattering though. it is true to size, but the length is strange. it seems a bit too long, yet is too short to look like a longer tunic. or maybe the waistline is a little low... whatever it is, it makes me look like i have short legs.also, the collar won't stay down, the way it is shown in the picture. but it may work better for someone wi
other I love this simple but stylish t shirt - the fabric is soft and it fits true to size and i knew i would love it even before it was delivered. i recommend it!!
other I loved the color and style then put them on and didn't take them off! they are so comfortable cane believe it. they are going to be my fall staple
3 I really liked the fabric and the design of this sweater, but the sleeves hung at an odd length (no way to push them up like on the model) and the sweater was large on me. i have broad shoulders but am otherwise petite. unfortunately i had to return this. glad others are having better luck.
other I can't say enough good things about this sweater. i bought it when it was full-price and it was totally worth it. it is incredibly soft and looks very sophisticated. i wish i could live in this sweater--given the color and my propensity to make a mess, i want to buy two more just in case!
other I purchased this sweater in the blue and i love the color. at first i bought the regular size extra small. i am 5/2" and 10other pounds. i had to return the xs for the xxs petite. i like the arms to be long so i don't usually purchase sweaters in the petite sizes, but this one in the xxs petite the arms are still plenty long enough. it is still very roomy. it is very soft and comfortable, slightly itchy, i wear a very thin long sleeve shirt underneath.
other This is a darling dress!  it is super flattering . . . except if you are a swimmer and have broad shoulders.  unfortunately i had to return it because it pulled so tightly across my shoulders/chest.  i ordered a size other and it was actually true to size other than failing to accomodate for an athletic upper body.  i'm 5'4", 118 lbs.  wish i could have kept this one!
other I am so in love with this dress. i think it is made of high quality fabric and very well designed. i am 5'6", about 145lbs, 34d and the other fit perfectly! i bought it for my upcoming bridal shower and could not be more excited to wear it!!
3 I do think this blazer is comfortable and looks decently cute, but wasn't sure about the fabric. hte coloring is fun too. i decided to pass on it only because of the previous review regarding shedding.
other I really wanted to like this because the color is beautiful and the knit is obviously good quality. but the shape is impossible to work with. it doesn't just run big, it just hangs there. really disappointing. it'll have to go back.
3 This is a very pretty shirt which is too narrow across the back. i need to be able to move my arms freely at work, so this did not work for me. you may be able to size up for a better fit if moving your arms is important to you.
other This sweater looks just as pictured on the model. its very warm though even with cropped sleeves. i ordered a large and it was true to size but roomy. i liked this top very much but is thicker than seems. outer grey material isn't very pleasant & itchy, however the bottom portion is an underneath gown and attached to sleeves inside so its very soft on touch.
other This looks cute on the model but was way too big, loose and sloppy for me. i probably needed a petite size. i ordered a regular xs, but returned it. it is an okay black top, nothing great.
other I am pretty obsessed with these and wish i could get them in many more patterns. the fit is ultra comfortable and true to size. the style allows you to put on a t-shirt, sweater, cardigan + t, whatever, and look completely put together. i got loads of compliments on them on the first day i wore them.
other After reading the reviews, i decided to order this top. i was so pleased, and when i wore it for the first time, i had someone ask me where i got it. it is perfect with leggings because it is long enough to cover my leggings in the front as well as in the back. i want to order it again in different colors.
other I am so in love with these pants. i generally stay away from wide legged pants because i think they make me look shorter (i am already short) but these are awesome. the fabric is not very thick so they are moveable which is great, but not so moveable that they feel like palazzo pants-they will hold their shape. i love the polka dot design so much and i actually really love the whole outfit with the black tie-top. these pants are long on me, but it isn't surprising since i am pretty short, i am t
other Pros: versatile summer weight t. perfect with jeans. flattering cut. nice color palette. made in the usa. reasons for not giving 5's for overall rating and quality... shirt is a bit short overall (i'm 5'4). fabric is thin and a mixed blend of poly, cotton, and rayon. will have to be careful with washing. better if you can purchase on sale. regular price was steep for a t-shirt.
other As a teacher, it's so great to be able to find dresses that are modest and beautiful, that i can wear to work, as well as on the weekends.
other I am an avid yoga fan so when i saw this tee i had to have it. i am usually a m/size 10 but as this tee is fairly sheer, i did better exchanging for a large. the fabric is so soft and it is very comfortable. a must have for yogis!
other These pants are perfect! they are amazingly comfortable and soft - i could wear them all the time. i'm 5'2" and have been looking for shorter jeans to wear with ankle booties, which has been pretty tough. i ordered 29 petite and the description said the inseam would be 24". i don't know if that's true since they fall right at my ankle and usually that's around a 26" inseam, but definitely a great length and i don't need to hem. the leg opening isn't too big, so i can roll it up/cuff them to get
other I bought this shirt yesterday for 30% off the sale price. i usually wear a m. the store only had s and i didn't want to pay for shipping, so i bought the smaller size. it was loose through the body, tight in the arms. you could size down if you need to. but if you have large arms, i would get your normal size or get one larger. the arm fabric does not have much give. the shirt dips low in the front and back, so it has ample coverage for your mid section. it also would accommodate just about any
other I tried on this sweater...love the flowing top, and it looked like the seam would hit right under my bustline.wrong.the seam came right across my bust on a medium; sized up to a large, same thing. this shouldn't happen! not sure who this would actually flatter.the sweater is high quality, and the colors are perfect. the fit needs work.
other This dress is lovely. the embroidery is beautifully done and with bright colors. the material is sturdy. the fit is overall true to size but slightly small through the bust. the length is several inches above my knees and i ordered the 6 regular even though i am only 5'4". the pockets are a bonus!
other This is such a beautiful shirt! for me, tts. i bought the size other (34b) it is a very detailed and tailored shirt so i can understand if your busty why you may have to size up. the attention to detail along with the embroidered butterflies sets this shirt a step above average. the color is an odd shade of olive but i like it and the butterflies have areas that you can see through but not in an im-modest way. i do not feel the need to wear anything under it.
3 I bought this dress for a wedding i have this summer, and it's so cute. unfortunately the fit isn't perfect. the medium fits my waist perfectly, but was way too long and too big in the bust and shoulders. if i wanted to spend the money, i could get it tailored, but i just felt like it might not be worth it. side note - this dress was delivered to me with a nordstrom tag on it and i found it much cheaper there after looking!
other I was very disappointed when it arrived and had elbow length sleeves. from the photo, it looked like full length sleeves. it went back.
other I love this dress. the fabric is butter soft, the strapless top stays in place and it hangs beautifully. it is such a wonderfully comfortable summer dress. as previously stated, i'm in love.
other Beautiful sweater, perfect length, surprisingly warm
other This shirt is so soft and buttery! it fits tts and just as shown on the model. for the sale price, this shirt is a gonga! good go-to shirt on those days where you're just not sure what to wear. one thing that slightly bothers me about this shirt is that the arm holes are a bit loose, so you can see your bra. i think if you wear a black bra with it though, it would be fine.
other This dress is such a lovely thing to have in my closet- it's so easy to pull on, but adding a nice pair of shoes, a piece of jewelry, and leaving my hair down reveals a gorgeous outfit that takes next to no time. i must admit, my local store didn't stock this dress so i wasn't quite expecting the texture of the fabric (i was expecting it to be smooth but it's almost ribbed?). it's soft and comfortable though, so that's certainly not a deal breaker. i only wish they'd had it in petite as i feel t
other I saw a photographer wearing this at a wedding i went to in october. i absolutely fell in love. it is beautiful. i can't wait to wear it for the holidays! i got the small petite and i am 5'2", 12other lbs. fit great. enjoy!
other I didn't think much of this tank while perusing sale items on the website. but after reading the reviews i decided to order it. and it did not disappoint. i ordered the green, which is more vibrant in-person than on the website. and i wore it the next day, which is always a good sign. i loved it so much i quickly ordered the white too. it is flattering, stylish and comfortable - an excellent combination! i highly recommend this tank as a summer staple. it goes with everything.
other Beautiful and high quality. unfortunately it made me look top-heavy. i am a 36dd .
other I'm in love with siyu! i saw this jacket/cape and the brilliant colors drew me in. i had to have it. i'm so glad i purchased it, it is wonderful. i would say that the colors are a bit more muted than in the puctures, but still a brilliant statement piece. i was considering getting the sleeveless golden mock turtleneck to go with it, but glad i didn't. the neck of the jacket comes up fairly high, and it probably wouldn't have shown. the wool material is very fine, not scratchy, and a bit stretchy
other I love this skirt! it is sooooo cute!! fits true to size and the color is beautiful. the cut out in the front gives the skirt a sexy touch, the fabric is very nice, i am in love! this was one of my best purchases from retailer!
other I am in between sizes (and styles) after having a baby. this dress looks great on my curvy figure and enhances my look with the cinching of the belt and the detail of the flutter sleeves. perfect length and really fits well. i am very happy with it!
other This skirt was too big so i returned it but did like it well enough to re-order. quality seems average; my only complaint is the lining seems too short for the skirt. why, on a maxi, is the slip lining a mini? the first thing my husband said was that it needed a slip. he didn't think it had one as he could see through the skirt to my knees. this is very lightweight fabric but could be worn all year around depending on the leg wear that is worn with it. it is a very versatile piece which is why i
other I love, love, love this top! the color is beautiful, a pinkish-orange, about exactly how it looks online. it is soft and light weight for summers. it does run a little big, i debated between a 0 and a other and ended up with a 2, i'm almost 5'7" and 130lbs for reference. it wings out on the sides at first, once i steamed it at home and relaxed the fabric a bit it draped nicely, so don't let that turn you off from it when trying it on! part of the design is cut out through out as a warning,
3 This is a nice dress, but i'm glad i tried it on in the store. not for women with bigger breasts. i'm 36d and size 10 didn't fit me on top. lace part was too short to cover the whole area. other than that color is great .
other These leggings are super comfy. i took the advice of other reviewers and ordered a size down and the leggings fit wonderfully. lately i've been having a problem with leggings falling down at the waist and these stay up nicely so i was very pleased. the leggings have a slight itch because of the sweater feel but they are very warm and i enjoy wearing them.
other Made by dawn suits are the bomb. the bottom is a tiny bit cheeky, but not thong territory- just enough side leg to be seriously sexy. the quality is fantastic, soft with nude lining. love the retro feel to the high neck top- enough support even for my 36d's. so comfy, i forgot i was wearing it at lunch. the normal triangle tops cut into my shoulders/neck, and this style does not. amazing quality and well worth the price.fyi- large top fit perfectly, but i needed a medium bottom.
other I absolutely love the dahlia bell-sleeve blouse. this blouse has a lovely flow. perfect for fall. sleeves have a slight bell that hang nicely. i would recommend this blouse to everyone!
other The dress is pretty, i ordered a other and 6 not knowing how it ran, i took both back the neck is too tight!
3 Very nice material, soft and feminine colors. however, the waist sat higher than my natural waist and was uncomfortable. unfortunately it's going back
other This is a great fit and super cute, price not bad either!!
3 Usually i am a huge meadow rue fan, but not this time. the print is okay, but the shirt seemed stiff and the material was not soft. if the print was just okay but the shirt was super soft or vice versa i would have probably kept the shirt, but since it was neither it was returned?
other I think 4-5" shorts are the best length if you want to show off your legs, but still feel comfortable running errands, and these fit the bill. they are short, but they are loose, the pattern ( i got the grey) is nice, wore them with a black top that flowed over the waistband and felt they were perfect. memorial day, wore them other days in a row, all day, everywhere, got lots of compliments, comfortable, washed and air dried, ready to go again. i am typically a 12, ordered the large, could probably
other This bra is incredibly comfortable but not meant for practices that involve a lot of movement (i.e.: vinyasa) but is perfect for lounging and personal practice. the orange is a beautiful color
other Warn and super soft. love it !
3 I purchased the moss color in this cardigan. i really love the texture of the material. it is very very soft. my issue with this is the arms. like other reviewers have said they are extremely small! i went up to a large rather than my usual medium and they were still tight. i really wanted this to work but i will probably return due to the arms.
other Love this top..got it in both orange and white and always get compliments, especially on the orange color - beautiful and vibrant color! very comfy top and washes well with no problems. the style does swing but not too huge.
other I couldn't wait to try on these shorts after reading all the positive reviews about them. my local retailer had them in the bright blue and coral in my size 26 and 25. i purchased the 26 and am content with them. they are a very lightweight cool pair of shorts. they do have a little stretch to them and the length is perfect.. i have to note they do wrinkle a bit but perfect summer staple. .
other I like the top; like the tie in the front. the material is stretchy. would imagine this will work for any size of chest. i wear either a small or medium, so thought i'd be safe order the medium, which turned out to fix more like a large. i'm taking it back for the small.....as it's a keeper.
other Saw this in my local retailer and thought it was stunning. i usually wear a size 8 because of my broad shoulders but ended up taking a 6 in this top. it was not tight in the arms (don't have super skinny arms) and the fabric flows nicely (not too much). the embroidery is amazing and am sure this top will be in rotation quite a bit!
other This sweater has a retro feel to it. i like how it hits right at the hips and it's not too long or not too short. it keeps you warm and it's a nice alternative to all the drab sweaters that you would usually wear in the fall or winter.
other I bought this dress on clearance and think it will be cute next summer, on a super-hot day with ballet flats. i have no idea what it's doing in the fall collection. am looking forward to wearing it 10 months from now!!
other This will be my go-to shirt for fall! its a great layering piece with just enough detail to make it different than a plain crew neck long sleeve...the neckline is unique & the slit in the back of the shirt adds interest. fit is slim, nicely tailored which makes it perfect for layering. i will likely purchase more colors once on sale! i purchased the dark grey and color is just as expected. my only drawback is how thin the material is - i can see it getting snags or holes easily, but i will deal
other I just bought this cardigan in black at the store and i love it. the tie at the waist is flattering and the fabric is soft and stretchy. the regular size fit me perfectly as far as where the waist and hem hit, although the sleeves had to be turned up (i'm 5'1" with more length in torso than limbs). i was so happy with the fit other than sleeve length that i bought the regular small rather than coming online for the petite. because the fabric is rather thin and the shape trim i can fold the sleev
other I love this top - it is the cutest top i've purchased in a while. the colors are so fun and the cut is flattering. it will go with plenty and will work for day and night, for work and on weekends. you need to get this top before it sells out. retailer please get this top in more patterns!!
other It is gorgeous, and yes, the side slits are very high, but i am still keeping and rocking it. i am a size 10-1other and got the large, probably could have got the medium, but after a few washings, i think the larger size will be ok. side slits high, but if the weather is good, and you have self tanner on legs, it looks great with shortie boots. i have gotten many cmpliments on it, just hope it still keeps its shape after a long day of wear. very pretty in cream, though, i do recommend it. i am 5'8,
other Run to purchase this jacket. i am in love. it surpassed my wildest expectations when it arrived. beautiful coloration, comfortable fit, fantastic fabric and gorgeous collar. i am so glad that i ordered it. please use this exact same design and offer this same jacket in other colors and patterns. i can't say enough good things about this item.
other This dress is beautiful and unusual. i think the colors shown in the picture are a little brighter than the dress i bought...the turquoise and gold seem slightly more muted in person, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. there are sequins along the shoulders of the dress that you also can't see in the picture, but they aren't gaudy or too stevie nicks-bohemian. i didn't find the bodice of the size m too tight as another reviewer noted...it's' my normal size, and though i'm a little chesty (32-34
other This is an awesome pointelle sweater. i love angel of the north sweaters. i bought the small (34b) and it fit tts. the pleats in the back hang without pulling. it also flatters the figure with it's shaping. it is a lightweight sweater in a great shade of red. just love it!
other I bought this shirt in the turquoise color with the navy trim and love it! color is as pictured. shirt is very soft and flowy. the length was a little shorter than expected (the slits on the side almost reach the top of my jeans) so i'm glad i got the regular xs and not the petite. this shirt is unique without getting too crazy!
other Just a wonderful shirt -- fabric is so soft, it feels like pajamas, and the blue is just perfect. there's a different blue plaid as a lining, and i almost wish it was reversible. they're both great patterns! wonderful for fall...
other This top is very airly and swingy.  definitely need to wear skinny jeans to off set the volume on top.  it is a pretty top and also unique so i kept it.
other A breath of fresh air. spring flowers! easy to wear. very feminine and flattering. looks great with denim, orange, reds , etc. very happy with this purchase.
other I purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailer's recent 20% off sale. i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate, but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night. they both seemed to be just what i was looking for. i ordered a other regular and a 6 regular, as i am usually in between sizes. the other was definitely too small. the 6 fit, technically, but was very ill fitting. not only is the dress itself short, but it is very short-waisted. i am only 5'3", but it fe
other I saw army green pants similar to this in the store, but then found these on line and ordered them instead. i love them. they stretch out a bit so i am glad i sized down. i could possibly have sized down even one more size. i got a 27. the waist is very comfortable, so maybe this is just the fit...after all, they are basically stylish fatiques. either way, they are casual but on trend. i have planned a ton of outfits in my head already because these pants will go with so much! i think the cuff w
other I bought this dress on a whim one day, even though i wasn't sure where i would wear it, but i just had to have it. this dress fits beautifully, and is very flattering. i am 5'9 and typically a size 1other with large hips, behind, and a smaller waist. the 1other fit me very well--snugged in all the right places and just right everywhere else. i ended up wearing this to a benefit and i received many compliments. go for it!
other This vest goes with literally everything. it is the perfect amount of added warmth - though it's a bit hard to fit under a coat. the only thing i will say negatively about it is that it seems to shed on the inside a bit... but otherwise the quality, color, and length are perfect. and i love the pockets!
other Wow. this is the perfect sweater. beautiful, soft color. lightweight enough to wear now and into the coming seasons. it drapes beautifully. the knit is tight, no see through or snags. very soft and comfy. the casual, easy, pulled together look is hard to do and this one does it with style. am starting to love this designer. highly recommend.
other I new i had to have this dress the moment i saw it. i am a recent convert to byron lars and have three dress of his design. they are all 6 or 6p so i felt confident ordering a 6. whoops! this dress fit perfectly up to the waist. it was even a little roomy but i couldn't button it up any further than that. it is a little weird since i always thought i had a narrow ribcage. anyway, i will have to exchange it for an 8p. and hope for the best. it really is an exquisitely beautiful dress and unbeliev
other Size up!!! this dress is great quality and so flattering but tight in the arms and chest. ordered in my usual xs and will regretfully need to return it.
other I agree with the other reviewer about the great colors, but when i took this off the rack to try one, you can see through both layers of fabric. i thought, insulting quality, for the price. i imagine the holes would start after one wearing.
other These are awesome! i have the pink which is a very light faded sort of color. they are beautiful and very nice quality. they are slimmer and stretchier then i imagined but very flattering.
other The pictures are not showing how absolutely spectacular this caftan is. it is very delicate (even says so on the tag) and lightweight so that you won't dread wearing it in the heat of the day. by what doesn't show up is that this caftan shimmers-there is gold string woven throughout the entire garment which gives it a slight sheen. it adds significantly to the impact of the garment, and i love this detail. i love the way this caftan drapes, and i love that it is longer than a normal caftan. the
other After reading many positive reviews i ordered. sure glad i did. i love the light, airy fabric. it hangs nicely. i am mostly a 12, sometimes a 14. i ordered both sizes and the 1other was a perfect fit. i am very pleased with this purchase. thought it might be too girly and/or young looking on me, but not so at all. i got the white and i certainly like the red detail at the button holes too.
other I love this flattering and comfortable jacket- it has a nice stretch and the color is out of this world. i think it will pack a big punch this fall.
other I really like this top. is casual and easy to wear with short right now and will be super cute with jeans when it gets cooler.
3 I love this dress and had so hoped to wear it to a wedding in june. the fabric is a perfect weight, very nice cotton, i only wish i could have kept it. i am 5'3", 133 lbs and usually wear a size 6 which is what i ordered. it was fine in the skirt but the top was at least a size if not two sizes too small for 3other chest. i did not want to wear it open with a tee and so had to send it back. the wedding date does not allow for the new available date for the dress.
other I was very disappointed by the fit of this top. it is quite short (especially in the back) and very wide. i did not find it flattering. on a positive note, the fabric is nice and thick - very warm layering piece for fall. for sizing reference, i'm 5'5'', 12other lbs, and took my usual size xs.
other I'm very pleased with this jacket! i've never owned a "vegan" leather anything, so i didn't know if it would show up cheap looking or smelly.. but to my surprise, it didn't have a "smell" or that shiny cheap look. i'm so glad i headed the other reviewers advise and i sized up, my typical size would have been to tight and short! i'm excited to wear this with dresses and jeans this fall! i bought the "honey" color and it's more like a cross between beige and blush(a slight dusty pink hue)! i love
other I was hesitant to buy this because it is double breasted which isn't my first choice. that was the least of the problems with this jacket. i love sparkle, and i love beautiful detail, none of the elements by themselves was a problem. the sum of the parts didn't work, though. the end result was an unflattering, confusing mess. the silhouette plus the frayed edges, plus the sequins plus the vent in back plus the huge buttons plus the double breast, plus the zipper were just too many things to go t
3 I wish i could wax poetic about this gorgeous cardigan. i would have happily bought it in both colors except for the deal-breaking design flaw - the extremely tight sleeves. even if you have stick-thin arms, i don't know how you would ever be able to wear anything other than a tank top under it. sadly for me, this was a no go :(
other So i can see why this might not be an amazing shirt, it runs a little large imo and its long. i'm 5'5" and its almost to my knees, but......as a nightgown, it's amazing! super comfy and its now my new favorite pajama dress. lol. i might wear it as a shirt too, but most likely just jammies!
other I tried this skirt on in a size medium. i am usually a small (4-6, 39 inches around the hips and butt) but there were no size smalls. the medium looked good but the waistline may have been a tad loose. the texture of the skirt is wonderful and it is lined! overall, the quality seemed good and it had a nice heft to it. the only thing i might say is that is is quite long--closer to my ankles and i'm just shy of 5' 9" and leggy to boot (i wear a 33" inseam with flats). with tall boots on, you saw j
other Very versatile top! i feel like i could dress it up or down. fits very nice and the material is soft.
other I bought this on a whim, and i love it. the colors are much brighter than the photo would indicate. it's definitely a poncho - oversize is the name of the game - but it's cozy, gorgeous and i wish i could wear it every day.
other This is a cute casual dress. i've received many compliments and wear it a lot. i deducted one star because the dress is pilling in some places (mostly expected friction areas, but others as well). also the back of the dress started to rip at the stress points for the button up area. i mended it, but it should have been reinforced to begin with for a dress at the original price point.
other I was worried this sweater would be too tight, but it has a very flattering fit. i am a librarian and this sweater makes me feel like a quirky librarian. i love it!
other So i almost returned this top without trying it on because i've been binging on tops with thin blue lines but so glad i didn't!! i'm busty like ddd36 and i weigh 170, but i got the 8 and it fits like a glove! perfection!! plus i got it on sale!! so fab!
other This is a super cute dress and i get lots of compliments when i wear it.
other I tried both the xs/s and the m/l and found the larger size to be more roomy in the shoulders, and just swish a bit better around the hips. this is a change from many long vests my closet, which tend to be size small or medium, as are my blouses and tops. however, could happily live with either size and color, gorgeous.
other This skirt is wonderful! the price point seems a bit high for the average office gal, but the quality is impeccable. i really enjoy looking at myself in the mirror when wearing this skirt. it can be dressed up, dressed down, worn during all seasons. the design/pattern is artsy and whimsical without being too "out-there" (unless you want it to be, of course!). the fit is true to size, and the delicate details are just lovely.
other I loved this dress as pictured online and when i received it i fell in love with the look as well as the fit. it is such a perfect dress for the day or night. i am so happy i ordered it.
other This is a very nice quality t-shirt. i loved the material & colors. i got it on sale and the only reason i had to return it because it was small on me. due to the nice sale, another size was not available.
other Super flattering and lovely material. dress-up or down. they run true to size.
other Happy with this top- slightly thinner material than i was expecting but that'll be fine with our hot summers. got the navy striped one- very pretty and extremely soft. washes well. i do wear an tank underneath though bc the armholes are slightly large and you can see part of my bra.
other I took a chance and ordered extra one for my daughter-without ever running it by her first. i'd first seen the sweater in the store when another customer was tracking it down. it looked so nice and unique i couldn't forget about it even though i didn't try it on at the time. very happy i got it on sale-and so i got two-luckily we go to our different workplaces in different towns!
other I bought the blue and it is beautiful. it definitely runs small and i agree with the other reviewer who stated to order other sizes up.
other Can i tell you this top is amazing?! get it quick before it sells out!!
other This dress is truly a no brainer purchase! it is a stunning dress with gorgeous embroidery, beading and  the color is just perfect for fall! i am only 5'other and i went with the regular size since i don't like to go too short. that said, you can totally rock this dress with leggings and boots if it is too short. i weigh 103 lbs and i am normally an xxs but i'm glad i went with the xs since it would have been too tight at the top and should even  be slightly loose fitting on the bottom. love everyth
other The material of this swimsuit is amazing. the swimsuit is expensive, but it is high quality in person. definitely one i'd recommend buying!
other I fell for the charcoal one and bought standard size m/l. on first wearing with slim jeans, booties and a long sleeved t, the body of the vest was fine. but with wavy shoulder-length hair, i found the large, wide collar overwhelming at the top. i tried folding the collar under, as in the photo of the gray one, but still too much. i altered it by paring it down by 7 inches at the back neck, and tapering down to meet the lapel at mid-chest. the fabric looks like boiled wool, but is actually a tigh
other This blouse is so pretty. i love the long tie. the pattern is very unique. it is a thin, light weight fabric so you can easily wear it underneath a leather jacket.
other I love these socks so much! i ordered the beige and red pair with the polar bear design and they are my new favorite socks. these are comfy, with great stretch and just the right amount of cushion. however, the best feature is the cute little frill around the cuff! i want to order more, but i don't care for the other designs as much as the pair i ordered. instead, i will be keeping an eye on this brand to see what they come out with next!
other I saw the cream top online and loved it, but it is even prettier in person. i typically purchase petite sizes online, but i tried on the 0 in the store and it fit nicely-- not super fitted throughout the waist as others have mentioned, but the length was just right and the arms/chest fit perfectly. for reference, i'm 5'2", 100 lbs, 32b. this will look great with skinny pants or jeans.
other Sits at waist, length is perfect for petite, quality is very good, looks very nice on me, very recommend
other This sweater coat caught my attention online, so i went in search for it at my local store. it's a flattering fit, across the chest and shoulders. very well made. the length is mid thigh. i am 5'4" 125lbs. i went with the small, with the thought of wearing nothing too bulky under it. it does have an attached belt, that can easily be knotted together or each on its own for another look, if you opt to leave it open. it's light weight enough for cool days or evenings, but also warm enough for colde
other This coat is just as nice as the russian one from a few years ago, and fits the same. it is stunning! i swear, life is way too short to wear only average coats. if you are a parks and recreation fan, think back to the treat yo self episode.....and you'll know what i mean! i can't say enough wonderful things about this one.
other Based on the first person's review, i ordered a l at first... then i got it and it kinda fit like a maternity shirt and looked a bit too baggy/sloppy, not as flattering as the picture. i tried using the measurement guide below, based on the bust measurement, and i'm at the low end of the m size, so i ended up ordering the m and s just in case. the s size fit like the picture. i'm glad this isn't slim in the waist and fitted nicely in the shoulders. the blue color is beautiful. if you are more of
other Great dress for fall! runs slim through the hips and neckline is a little low.
other This dress is so beautiful! i ordered it online and when i received it i was so pleased with how it was even better in person. the fit, the embroidery, the lovely fall colors - makes this a perfect dress all the way around!
other I tied this on a whim, thinking it was a big 80s on the hanger, but it is so cute and hip, i fell instantly in love. the material is amazingly soft and generally doesn't wrinkle. i wore it for my thesis presentation and it went flawlessly! it has a very light light-grey window pane print on it that looks great with grey pixie pants, white pants, and the blue is light enough you could even pair it with black bottoms and jeans. a total catch, and the fun layover in the back is just an added pop of
3 This is just okay for me. the top is soft and surprisingly flattering, especially from the side, but the front rides up and the neckline never lays flat. it washes well and the tan/white combo is cute, but a little transparent.
other Nice fabric, great color, would be lovely ... on someone with a straight-and-narrow body type. for ladies with curves, take a pass--too much like maternity wear, and not in that elegantly slouchy kind of way. the straight-up "is she or isn't she" kind of way.
other This dress is so flattering! i absolutely love it! it hides a multitude of flaws. the sleeves are just the perfect length for me, as is the length of the hem. the waist also sits right where i want it in the regular sizes. the material is comfortable and has a little give to be a little clingy on top but flares perfectly on the bottom not too far out that it makes your bottom half look huge. just perfect!
other I purchased this top in the navy. the picture makes the top look like an interesting blue with some purple in it, but in person the top is just... navy. the lace and fabric are soft. it fits true to size; i almost always wear a small and the small fit fine. it wasn't quite my style, but it's a pretty top that will be great for spring and summer.
other I love this top! usually i prefer neutral colors, but i looked at every one of the colors, and fell in love with the pink. i think it looks the best with the embroidery at the top. i too love this cut on my shoulders for summer. i would definitely recommend this top. i bought an xs and it's perfect. this shirt made me feel like twirling, i love it.
other This may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried. the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo, absolutely garish. the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties, it just looks cheap. the skirt is an antebellum nightmare.  i did not even want to try it on, it's that bad. i considered adding a photo, but was too horrified.for reference, i'm 5'10", approximately the height/ size of the model, but it was shorter than the photo depictes. i wanted to like it,
other I have been unable to find a jumpsuit that looks good, likely due to my long torso. this is the first one that doesn't make me look like i am a tall five-year-old (easy to dress it up with a statement necklace) and fits perfectly. i am 5'6", 120 pds, and bought my normal xs. highly recommend, especially with the current extra % off promotion!
other This dress is a work of art both online and in person. the color is more vibrant in person and both colors are beautiful. i like the mango color better because it looks better on my olive skin tone, plus i like the purple flowers against the orange background. thank goodness for the liner because this dress is very thin. it wrinkles easily but i think it comes with the territory due to the thin silk fabric. for short gals like me, a belt is a must for a structured look if worn with heels; otherw
3 This would be great on someone with a slim build. it's very true to size, it hits above the hips and runs pretty straight through the body for a boxy look. i loved the color and pointelle detail but on my thicker build it just sort of hung in a too-casual way. note that it is the kind of cotton that is likely to stretch with wear (and spring back with cleaning).
other I'm not sure why this skirt is described online as having a blue motif. the background is black and the blue in the pattern could pass as grey. the material is a strong polyester which should be nice and easy to clean but it almost feels like silk. i love the aline and even with the ruffles it looks very slimming on this pear-shaped gal. i can see wearing it with strappy sandals and a light blouse in the next few weeks but pairing it with a sweater and boots well into the fall and winter. i thin
3 This blouse is gorgeous, but as other reviewers have noted it runs small and it's very thin. the back is see-through, not the front, though if you tend to wear things a little large and order up a size, the back is fine. my real issue is that it shrank so much when i washed it (on cold, delicate cycle, hang dry) that it's pretty much unwearable now. sad.
other I originally ordered the peach stripe tee in my normal size, medium. after going to the store and trying another color on in a small i realized i should have sized down. i have since purchased the blue stripe in the smaller size. i love the fit and the colorful stripes of both. great light-weight, casual tee. i love the button details on the shoulder.
other I had to return the other for a size other and it is still snug in the ribs. i am very petite and usually wear size 0 and xs. the regular length hits me perfectly above the knee as i like. the previous review to order up was good but i'm writing to say i had to go up other sizes. i am 5'5" 110 lbs, small frame.
other I am currently wearing this dress. i wear it whenever i can get away with it. i have it in red and it works incredible on my coloring. the front is modest enough for work while the back is sweet and unexpected.
3 Wanted to love these pants, they are way, way, too long (i'm 5'other 128lbs for reference). i didn't love the way they looked cuff and didn't think it was worth having them hemmed. loved the color. would work well for someone tall and slim.
other I tried this dress on in the store but decided to think about it because of price. i ended up buying it later on line. i usually wear a medium (5' 7" 128 lbs wide shoulders) but got a small in this dress. it does run the risk of looking like a sack but sizing down did the trick! the easy going loosness yet elegance is why i like it. it is so comfy but looks lucious. i plan to wear it often this fall and christmas.
other Just got this in a other petite (5'4" 120lbs 34b) and it fits perfectly. the length is right at the bottom of the knee. it is fitted tight at the waist and the belt is even more beautiful in person. this dress has some weight and the quality seems excellent. there is a scalloped nude lining that is attached to the dress and the dress can be unzipped from the bottom as well.there is a darker lace fabric under the armpit which i like since it hides your armpits much better than the sheer red lace fab
other This is a lovely embroidered (hard to see in the pictures) shift that i purchased to wear to a fancy fundraiser. it has vintage '60s lines that are fun. very forgiving fit. i am 5'5" 12other lbs with a 32dd bust and purchased a other petite (for a great price!!!). i might alter it so it has a bit of a waist curve, but that is minor.
other I fell in love with this top when i saw it online. i love tracy reese! the pattern is beautiful and the yellow is even brighter in person. i ordered a size small even though i normally wear an xs in all tops. for whatever reason, there was no xs offered, which is odd. the straps are adjustable which is good but unfortunately you absolutely cannot wear this top without fashion tape to keep the straps from falling off your shoulders. the straps slipped off my shoulders constantly. i wore a coobie
other I am other feet and 120 lbs. i ordered the honey. quality was excellent. no button issues. fits true to size. i ordered a small petite. my issue was the chino fabric was too casual. it's okay. if it were on sale i would keep it, but not at full price. color is as shown in the honey. no issues on arm length. but i like mine a little longer. it's kind of menswear. which some gals would like. i am a 3other c and it only looks good buttoned up on me. i'd say if your on the fence give it a try. it's tts.
other This romper is absolutely gorgeous. the embroidery is detailed and lovely and the fit is feminine and flattering. it's super versatile and easy to dress up or dress down depending where you want to wear it. i'm in love! it is a little on the sheer side, though, and i chose to wear a tank top underneath for more coverage, but this was an easy fix. it was a reasonable trade off to wear a camisole under in exchange for the lightweight and flowy material. totally obsessed.
other Uhm no. oh dear, no. i was initially drawn to this blouse's lovely fabric, the color and pattern are truly stunning. i decided to give it a try because it seemed somewhat boxy, oh boy was i right. sadly, this is one of the least flattering tops that i've ever tried on at retailer. it might be a great maternity top, though.
other Hack: wrap the sash around waist twice and tie in back!! agreed with other reviewers it is a bit sack like when the sash tied in front as seen on model. but wrap twice, and it makes the silhouette pop. fabric is rediculously lush, and pattern is very sophisticated. stunning dress, will be wearing all summer -- with flats for work, with heels for evening. oop, my usual size, fits perfectly (5'4, 110 lbs).
other 1. i'm 5'5" tall, 14other lbs, and 38-32-40. i'm normally a size 10, but i took a 1other in this skirt.2. it's comfortable and has pockets that you can really put your hands in.3. sits at high waist. hem hits below the knee.4. i didn't like the buttons. they are very round and stick out quite far. they are also mismatched. i would have liked them better if they were flatter.5. i also didn't like the mustard color. it's unflattering to me.
other I initially bought this dress to wear to an interview that required something casual, yet could be dressed up with interesting jewelry. although i ended up wearing another black dress, i kept this.  paired with interesting black booties and a great necklace, this dress is easy to wear  - and stylish. most importantly, comfortable. i could see myself wearing this on days that i feel inspired to dress up, but want to wear something that is not fussy. and, the pockets!
other Really pretty. not very itchy and a great sweater to dress up or down.
other This is an adorable top. i had to have it in both colors. it has a unique shape to it, and the simple details give it so much appeal. the beautiful fall like colors can be layered easily into the cooler weather of the season.
other I really liked this top. i wish it was not so sheer. even with a nude bra, its just too much. it's a very loose fit throughout the body, but the shoulders, arms, and neckline remain true to size so it looks nicely tailored on the top. i just can't do something this sheer. i feel too exposed. i wish they had it offered in other colors.
3 The dress has a flattering cut and is a nice color. but, the fabric looks like old, matted carpet. i will be returning.
other I'm not a big fan of rompers but love this one. it is very flattering and comfortable. i love that you can dress it up with some heels and accessorizes or more casual with flats.
other I love this sweater! i ordered the xs petite. it fits perfectly! it is soft. i hate itchy sweaters. the "peach" color is actually more pink, but i love the color. great buy! i'm ordering another one.
other These are a great casual workday pant. the loose fit and light weight material makes it a great summer option.
other This dress first caught my eye online. due to the price i resisted. then i saw in store and tried on...i decided to hold off for a sale, but my will was getting thin. once i saw it start to sell out online, i had to take the plunge. i knew this dress was a must have. it is super flattering and comfy! the best of both worlds. i'm small-chested so both the s and m fit, but the seam on the s fit a bit higher, which was more flattering on me, so s is what i got. it can be dressed up or slightly down
other The patters/colors on this dress are much more stunning in person. it is lined and feels very well made. the pockets don't add bulk to the hip area as many times they do, which is great. the fit can be tricky if you have any semblance of curves. if you can, try this one on in a store before buying. for reference: i am 5'7", have broad shoulders, am pear shaped (i have hips and a good sized rear end), 34b bust, weigh 14other lbs., and generally wear a size 6 or 8 for tops and bottoms. the size 8 fit
other I usually wear a medium in tops from deletta so i would say this top is true to size. i personally loved the fit. in the front, the seam goes up slightly to follow the bust line. there are some gathers in that area as well so that any little bulges in the tummy area are hidden. the fabric falls nicely there. the seam at the waist on the side and back hit exactly at my waist. i love both of the prints. the tops seem to be well made. time will tell.
3 The description doesn't indicate the metallic thread throughout the design. you cannot tell from the pix either. it's also a really strange design with the arm holes being almost the entire length of the sweater. can't decide if i want to keep it or return it.
3 I tried this dress on in the store. it fit okay, but the orange is so bright, i couldn't bring myself to buy it.
other Just gorgeous, the dress makes a nice transition piece for early fall! perfect in every way!
3 I lived the front and back designs but didn't like the fit.
other I didn't notice this online but it caught my eye in the store. the colors are bright and beautiful. i wear a 10/1other or m/l. i tried the 1other but the bust was too big (i wear a 36c). i ordered the size 10 and it fits perfect. i'm so glad i saw it in the store. i think it makes much more of an impact in person than online.
other I have this in another color and it is my absolute fav! transform any outfit! it has an over-sized fit.
other These pilcro's jeans are so good!!! love the fit, the color, and the feel. i am a curvy girl and these are great, they hit me just right. now pilcro jeans used to strech out really bad but they seemed to have fixed the problem.i wore these jeans at work for 10 hours and they did stretch some but not a dress size, so i would buy the size you feel the most comfortable. i think these are a no brainer!
other This is a very pretty skirt and the colors are better in real life. sizing was mostly true to size for me, slightly tight in the waist but i have a thicker waist compared to my hips. i'm 5'7 and 138# and ordered a size other (i usually size up to a 6 with retailer pencil skirts.) a 6 probably would have fit as well, especially in the waist but didn't want it too big in the hips. length was perfect, to my knees.
other These are a comfortable, flattering casual pant. i usually wear a 27 in skinny jeans, so i dropped down to a 26 to make sure they weren't to baggy. i love them and will wear the a lot!
other When i saw this top.... i had to have it.....runs very small... would size up especially if curvy on top.......sheer but not too sheer...... feels and looks delicate...... no problems so far
other Dress is awesome and makes you look skinnier.
other Just purchased this on sale. will be perfect for summer on those days you wear dresses and don't want your skin to touch the subway bench! love it!
other This is a great summer skirt that is good for work or casual wear. the fabric is soft and the colors go with most anything. one downside is it wrinkles easily.
other This duster is a nice light weight dark navy that you can throw on to add a little something to a your outfit without adding bulk or warmth. looks nice over dress, jeans, crops. just a fun little item to have in you closet that you can grab to put a little twist to an outfit. best part of the duster....it has pockets!! i love being able to slide my iphone into a pocket while on the go!
other I loooove this. my favorite retailer purchase in a while and i buy frequently. ran out of s p while in my basket (there are never enough petites available) so i got the medium. it is big but with this style i can pull it off. it does run a bit large so a s would have been perfect. please make this in more colors/fabrics! i would buy them all!
other This dress fits true to size. i ordered an xs like i usually wear as a small was falling off of me when i had tried on in store. the colors are more vibrant in person. it's a really pretty dress and is very well made. the fabric is solid and light weight. i don't think it would work for someone with a lot of curves unless they sized up though as it is a really straight dress that is meant to lay free.
other This dress is adorable and professional at the same time. i was worried that the print would overpower me but it's a nice fabric. i'm 5'2" and the petite small is perfect. i don't like to wear form fitting clothing for work and this fits right for me. plus it's hand washable. i haven't worn or washed it yet but i'll easily wear it to my "creative professional" workplace.
other Love this skirt! the material is so soft and flowy, but holds a nice a-line shape. i do agree with the other reviewers that this does run a bit small. i am a 26" waist and purchased a 4... and i could probably have considered sizing up to the 6 easily as well.
3 Was really excited to get this, but got it on and i was swimming in it. i'm not a tiny girl thicker athletic build and the large was massive. sadly had to return. don't know if i'll try a size down.
other This dress is great, and looks even prettier in person, the colors are more vibrant. the ruching is very forgiving for the belly and the length is perfect. most maxi's are too long on me, but i ordered a ps and it fit perfect. my only complaint is that it is very low cut, which i was unaware of standing up, but when i sat down at a dinner party, well, let's just say i gave everyone a show :(. recommend wearing a cami or something underneath.
other Incredibly flattering cut! i got so many compliments when i wore this dress to a friend's wedding. with the built in bra, you don't have to add extra uncomfortable layers. it stays put with or without the straps! the skirt is blissfully full and fun for twirling. i had a little trouble figuring out the belt, as it wraps around multiple times. but once i worked that out, it was perfect! love this cut! i hope they make it again it different colors!
other This top definitely drew my attention when i walked into the store. i loved the back and the fabric is super soft/silky. i tried it one and the usual 0 - fit nicely, i don't have petite to compare, or 00, but i decided to stick with 0. it will look so nice with white shorts (or navy# or jeans or even my denim pencil skirt... why i decided to buy it #i really must avoid the store!)11other lbs for reference...
other Fun detail with the beading and lace! arms are a little longer while the body of the sweatshirt is a little shorter than expected, but that's the style of the piece. the fit was tts with those proportions mind.  the ladies at the store said that if i ordered the size up, it might be a little longer in the body, but that the arms and shoulders would have been the biggest change. the material isn't too thick, so it's a nice lighter layer for fall/spring. really love it!
other I tried this one twice, in the same day, the first time, i didn't like it, the stylist in the dressing room at the time dind't etiher, but then my favorite stylist finally showed up (:-) ) and i tried it on again, but at the time, had changed pants... made all the difference. you really need hte right pants for htis, but it is gorgeous.i bought hte black color online, i liked it better, the white has stell colored polka dots, so if you want more of a spring color, also good for you.style: ca
other Cute, basic white shirt with nice detail. i love meadow rue and this is another great shirt from them. while i love it, i wish it were just a little bit softer (i am a sucker for soft things). however, i am keeping the shirt and it will be great for work or play.
other These pants are fabulous. the flow and feel made my mind up easily to purchase these. i have a long torso and short muscular legs. the style complimented by body type. being culottes, the hem should probably fall higher up on my legs. i will probably have them hemmed. the pleat has a nice kick to it. now off to find the right pair of shoes...
other Not my typical sleepwear, but glad that i took a chance, as it is super cozy for lounging. i was worried about covering my bottom (as i purchased the matching leggings), and ordered s based on prior reviews. ended up exchanging for xs as it was too oversized. could have purchased the petite probably as xs is still a bit long (5'2"), though fits like in photos.
other I really love these jeans! they are so comfortable and are very flattering. i am 5'10 and a size 6. i bought the 28 regular and they fit perfectly. i have high hips, so i appreciate the mid rise in these. the length was perfect too, so i'm glad i did not purchase the tall. the length was the same on me as in the picture. the jeans arrived uncuffed, and they look just as cute without the cuff as they do with. i will definitely wear them with and without a cuff for different looks. i am very happy
other Alas, i so wanted to love this. the photos of the models wearing it look gorgeous -- flowy, drapey, ultimate grecian goddess. but it just doesn't work unless you're super-skinny. too much material. almost bulky; strange looking. the print is so beautiful -- i love the pink floral, and i love the whole idea of the dress. but it just doesn't work. have to send it back. (i'm 5'6", 13other pounds, 38-30-38, and i ordered a 10.)
other If you have a love for vintage, romantic, feminine attire, this is the dress for you. it evokes memory of days gone by. it isn't just beautiful, the quality is superb. make sure you check the measurements for this little beauty has so stretch to it.
3 I wanted this dress in wine for a holiday party. but it just has no life whatsoever. unlike prior reviewer, i found nothing to dislike about the fabric. the fabric is fine and the fit is fine. i'm sometimes an 8 and sometimes a 6; took this in an 8 and definitely would not size down. it's relatively close- and well-fitting, but the sleeves and neckline further ruined it for me. the sleeves are shapeless, long and baggy. the neckline is just blah. it needs to be neater, trimmer, more cut. the ruc
other This is an awesome vest - so soft, cozy, and i cannot wait to wear it through fall and winter. for sake of not repeating all the positive aspects that the previous reviewers did, i'll mention the one flaw...no pockets :( still totally worth full price in my mind though.
other Knitted midi skirts are part of my daily uniform so i was drawn to this one. its high quality showcases intricate details: the pattern on the front is different from that on the back, the hem is asymmetric and is reverse high-low, the flat waist means the skirt is not too voluminous. the colors and pattern are reminiscent of missoni. it should be easy to coordinate with solid tops. wonderful quality and machine washable. i'm 5'5" and the petite medium fits me as pictured. since i want the back t
other I love this top! it's easily both day and night-worthy with a splash of sexiness in a front peek-a-boo design. lovely embossed design all over.
3 The top looks like an oversized shirt in the model photo but as you can see it's not at all in person. made with what feels like hospital scrubs-meets-crisp-poplin, this shirt is stiff and does not lay flat against the body. the cut is almost triangular or bell shaped causing it to jut out - think of a flared wide leg pant - but as a shirt. the sleeves have a similar cut as well. i, too, am a 34c and found it made me look much wider as your bust will cause the shirt to move away from you. it's s
other Weird fit and the tie just add to the problems. i think i'd like this a lot more if it were just an open cardigan without the tie. the tie seems like an after thought. it's flimsy and it just makes anyone wearing this look like a house -- no matter there size. i ordered a medium black and it's already in the mail!
other On shopping trips i try to try on at least one thing that i like but don't think will look that great on me. this dress was that item today. not only did i like it, but i liked the way it looked on me. i'm 5'3", 140 pounds and purchased the medium. i loved it, the clerks loved it, and my very honest daughter also loved it. i will wear it as a dress and also as a tunic over skinny jeans.
other The design is very cute. i'm glad i listened to reviews b/c this blouse definitely runs at least other sizes small maybe 3. i bought the blue and it's more of a navy blue instead of royal blue. at the sale price and additional 40% off (my daughter is an employee) i didn't mind paying $2other :).
other This looks nothing like it does on the website. it runs small and the colors are so muddy. it doesn't drape nicely and i a musually an xs and this was short, stiff and plain ugly. sent it back immediately.
other I really like these pants - great color and design. they are even lined! unfortunately, they do not work on my curvy frame - all the usual problems: waist too large, hips too small. sadly, i am taking them back.
other I am rarely disappointed by maeve and this was no exception. i am a 32b and broad shouldered and my normal size 6 fit like a dream. the white print is opaque so no bra see-through. such a cute, fun print! the fabric has a really soft hand too.
other I am usually a medium, but sized down to a small for a more fitted look. the light pink is slightly sheer, but will look great over leggings and jeans. i love the detail on the sleeve.
other I tried this jacket on and found it extremely flattering. the knit is soft and feels more like a sweater than a jacket in that it isn't constricting. i am usually between a small and medium and the small was plenty big. the fur collar is a special touch. the one i tried on had several loose threads hanging from the seams and the seams puckered a bit here and there. i loved the jacket but did not feel that the quality in construction i would expect was there. however, the fit is so flattering i m
other I saw this in stores and ran right up to it because of the gorgeous embroidery work and vivid colors - unfortunately those bright colors are totally washed out in the online model pics...barely recognizable! the fabric itself is super soft and not at all stiff, plus it has pockets! i can see this looking great with leggings and boots, but the sleeves flared a little too much which i think would add bulk under a cardigan, so it might not carry as far into cooler months as i would like. my usual s
other This shirt is nice and flowy. it can be dressed up or down. very lightweight for summer, but the color will work for early fall too.
other Cute shirt, it looked big so i ordered a size smaller. worked fine. would have liked the option to go even smaller so i would suggest ordering down. ultimately too baggy on my frame so sending back. fun shirt though!
other This print combination is like an arts and crafts wallpaper sampler, and is simply beautiful. size down and tuck it in for the best look, but wear a high-waist bottom with it, since it runs a bit short.in the torso.i didn't find the same transparency problem of which other reviewers complain.
other I don&amp;#39;t write many reviews but i loved this dress and had to share! i&amp;#39;m normally about a true 6 and have been finding a lot of retailer dresses running rather large. i tried this on in the store in a other and because of the stretch in it, it fit my hourglass shape really well. i have a melodies that pencil dress in a 6p that fits great so this style i think runs a bit larger. i wore it to a date night and it helped make the evening special.
other Beautifully made, well constructed and kangaroo pouch gives it character. turtleneck is very low, sweater is very appealing. great buy, especially when on sale.
other Great tee! color is vibrant, material is soft, fits great.
other I tried this tunic on in my local retailer store. they do not carry petites, so i tried on a regular small (i'm 5'2", 130lb). the proportions were a bit off. the v-neck fell way too low and there was extra material puckering across the bodice. i definitely think a petite would work better for my height. alas, no petites in-store or online in the color(s) i would purchase. i didn't find the shirt too thin, as some have commented. it's essentially a midweight t-shirt material (but rayon, so beware o
other I love all my retailer clothes! it's my favorite store! i even love the displays!
other Beautiful top runs true to size. i&#39;m in between an xs &amp; small and went with the xs. it fit great and was beautiful for holiday photos. it has hints of silver in it.
other I love this jacket. i have worn it twice and gotten compliments both times. the details on the sleeves are so unique and interesting. it fits tts. i am typically an xl and i ordered that size- i can wear a long sleeve collared shirt underneath so it is perfect for me. the pictures on the website don't do it justice. it looks much nicer in person.
other Really flattering cut, this shirt is perfect for fall. got so many compliments the first time i wore it!
other Amazing dye so uniqueyou can put in washing machine no prob make sure you put in dryer with a non static dryer sheet for the dress to be super soft
other Bought this cardigan on a whim as a birthday treat pre myself! love it! i get a compliment everyone i wear it! the quality is great, fits great (with a roomy feel).
other I ordered it online so i wasn't sure how thick the sweater coat would be and when i received it i was pleasantly surprised at the thickness and high quality. definitely worth the price!
other This was an unexpected surprise. i love the material of this short sleeved (almost sweatshirt) summer tee. the entire design reads late summer stripes with a cozy twist! the first time i wore it made me realize how tricky it can be to wear stripes and this design deconstructs all my previous hangups!
other Looks great with jeans for a more bohemian look.  i normally wear a medium but went large to accommodate a 6 month pregnant belly.  the blouse is loose enough i probably could have stayed with the medium.
other I saw this dress online and fell in love with it. it is just as beautiful in person too. very delicate, but receive so many compliments every time i wear. it is two separate pieces, a slip dress and the overlying fringe dress. i am 5'4" and need a other inch wedge heel to keep the bottom from dragging. probably could have tried to order the petite but figured i'd probably be wearing heals anyway. i normally wear a 6/8 in dresses and the medium fit perfectly and is so flattering! the top half is flow
other Beautiful dress for those with a large chest and small waist. sadly i am not one and needed to return the dress. fabric is heavy and the pattern is great.
other I wanted to love this top, but similar to many of retailer's styles (especially this season), this top is very large and tent-like. normally i like a larger top, but i was not expecting the length of this top. it might be cute belted if that is your style, but still much more like of a tunic than a top - could also make a nice maternity top. i am 5'7" and ordered a medium and this top hit me much lower than pictured on the model. the fabric and pattern, as well as the neckline are very nice
other This tee is versatile, soft, well made, and it washes/dries well. i love longer length and stripe pocket details. it runs true to size, and it is a beautiful dark navy blue. what more can i ask for?
other I tried this dress on in the store. i loved the fabric and color, but the fit was huge, no matter how much i sized down. there are full dresses and tunics that are supposed to be loose, but this was shapeless in an unflattering way. i was attracted to the style and color, but the execution left much to be desired.
other These sold out in my size 16 before i even knew they existed! (probably a great indication that your in-between and plus-size customers are hungry for more options from you). please restock so i can get in on this apparently-perfect pant!
other I just tried it on and it fits well, with no extra room. it seems like a nice fall piece to have in your wardrobe. the color leans more towards green. now i have to figure out what to put on top when i wear it!i think it will be cute with boots.
other I didn't think i'd like this due to the high neck, but i was in the store and it was so soft that i tried it on in the black motif. this dress is so comfortable and flattering. it's definitely a versatile piece: dress down with a denim jacket or dress up with heels. and it has pockets!
other 1. this looks so cute on the model, doesn't it? i have no idea where you wear a suit with hot pants, but it looks cute.2. that said, keep in mind the model is probably 6 feet 10 inches tall. i'm other feet 6 inches tall, and this jacket came down to my knees. i'm not kidding. the 3/other length sleeves were at my wrist, so more like 7/8 sleeves.3. i'm normally a size 1other in cartonnier jackets, but this only comes s, m or l. the medium is really a size 10, which was too tight across the shoulders and
other I thought i'd add a review because a lot of this landscape-print tee was still available at my local durham, nc store (the week after xmas anyway). it's a little different in person than how it appeared online (when it was still available). the white cotton is definitely a cream or off-white. and the silkscreen is darker colors and much more metallic than shown. the metallic is a subtle gold. it's definitely 3/other sleeves, which i like and it has a curved bottom hem. the surprise to me was that it
other I love this dress. the fabric is a little heavy, so it won't blow away on a windy day (and bonus, even with my triple d chest i'm comfortable not wearing a bra with this) but may not be what you want to wear on a really hot day. the shape is flattering on any body type-i am 6 months pregnant and it still looks great. it can go from spring to summer to fall quite easily, with the addition of a jean jacket and some converse or vans instead of sandals. i'd absolutely recommend this dress.
other I was uncertain about purchasing this dress. wow so glad that i did. i'm 5'5" and 138lbs. i can wear a small or medium so i ordered both. the small was plenty big enough. wore it to a family event and received numerous compliments. so different from anything else and classy with the longer length. thanks for a great dress! i hope that it cleans well!
other I don't think it's possible to say enough good things about this dress! the fit is beautiful (i'm 5'6", 130lbs, and am a 32h,) the material is soft and swishes around your legs in a delightful way, and the length has all the positives of a maxi dress without dragging on the ground. it doesn't show bra straps. it looks good with either heels or a trusty pair of birkenstocks. the pattern is fun. essentially, it's the perfect summer dress.
other I have seen this dress for a while and was holding off, but then i decided to try it on (the regualar) size in store to keep in mind for my next binge :-).the cut is flattering, length is jsut above my knee so i would not get the petite on this one. i would, as others have mentioend, wear it with a belt. overall it fits like a nice comfy t-shirt with comfy skirt, but as a dress, very nice.
3 I recommend with reservations. these leggings are 100% wool, soft, not itchy, light weight, lovely knitted pattern. they run large. i sized down to a small. the first time i wore them they were fine. but the second time the waist stretched out and was useless: they were falling down as i walked. such a shame because everything else about them is perfect for cold winter days. they even fit under my silk skirt and would make other lighter garments wearable in winter. so what to do? at the price th
other This dress is beautiful. i ordered this in the mail and literally said "wow" when i took it out of the packaging. the color looks more like champagne in person and the flowers look fantastic on it. i was worried that it might look a little awkward with so many things hanging off, but instead the flowers really compliment the entire ensemble. it really just looks like a work of art. i'm usually a small in retailer clothes and that size fits me very well. i absolutely love this dress.
other Oh my! i love this tee. it is super soft. i love how it doesn't look like a sack with no shape. i can't wait to get more colors. i am tall plus have a long torso and it still is long enough for me so this is definitely a win!
other This dress is huge. i am normally a l-xl regular in retailer brands. i love a loose, flowy dress. after trying one on in the store (just a random returned petite xl) i ordered the petite medium. and it was still huge and not flattering. so sad. i wanted to love this- loved the material and colors, but way off.
other Very comfortable. fits true to size. i also have this in white. fits snug in the top but hangs loose around the waist making it very comfortable. shirt is very flattering. the polka dots add a playful touch. super cute.
other I knew i had a winner when my husband said "cute top" the first time i put this on. the style, quality and sizing are all excellent. i love the lace detailing in addition to the open shoulder style. i am always looking for long sleeve tops that go great with jeans and are right on trend. this a great addition to my all wardrobe.
other I was hesitant to try this on because honestly, it looked so short. however, i just bought this at my retailer store and it is very flattering on! 1st of all, it runs big. my normal size (12) was way too big and i had to go down a size. i could have gone down other sizes but the length became problematic. in my regular size (that was too big), the skirt hit me a few inches above my knee. perfect! in the size smaller, it was a tad higher; wish it was the same longer length as the 1other but still acceptabl
other This is as beautiful in person as online, but the length is shorter than the description, and the arms are tight! although i am 5'1", i normally wear regular sizes in retailer just fine; however, the 28" length scared me off, so i ordered a 2p. it says it's 26.25" long, but it's actually just about 24". and my normal sized arms struggled to fit into the sleeves - yikes! but it's gorgeous and was purchased with a gift card, so i will keep :-)
other So i love this top. i got it in black and red. both are amazing and go with about anything. they run a bit large. i sort of forgot to read the label and thought it was just a cotton turtleneck. i threw it in the washer on regular settings and cold water and hung it to dry. i would say it shrunk 10% at most. beyond that, no difference. in fact, it fits better after it shrank since it was a bit big. obviously, if you do not dry clean this, you are going against manufacturer recommendations, but i
other Beautiful embroidery and good quality jeans. you can really dress up with these for special occassion.
other Very unique, cute top. i had to order up a size as i thought it ran a little on the small size.
other Very much in love with this ethereal, delicate dress. the silk is very light and slightly clingy, so take caution when wearing. the belt can be adjusted as modeled or you can get creative as there is length the play with. the liner finishes above the knee on me in medium petite. those of slender torsos and small busts may want to size down, otherwise tts. for reference i am 5'3" 36dd 140#
other This top is just as pretty in person as it is online. i usually buy petites, but ordered this one in the regular length and i'm glad i did. perfect on me at 5'2". my usual size medium fit great everywhere else too. love their fabric choice as well. i'm getting really tired of the thin cottons and slub jersey materials being used so often now. deletta made my day once again!!!
other I love this top (so cute and comfy!), but i wore it twice, washed it once on gentle and layed to dry.....now there are other small holes in the front. for as much as it cost, i would have expected it to be more durable. very disappointing, especially since i don't live near an retailer and can't take it back easily......
other I really love this top, great colors, comfortable, long enough (always a problem for me), light but feels quality fabric and nice details.
other Love this top, but the xs is still way too big, swallows me. 5'1" petite. wish it came in a petite offering. sadly, had to return this item.
other This dress runs a bit small in my opinion. for reference i'm a 36/38 c and usually a 10. the medium is tight at the bust. the material is beautiful but it looks like a petite cut on me. the sleeve and overall length are too short and i'm going to return it.
other Love this skirt! i did have to get one size larger than usual but the length was perfect on me and i love the color (i got the slate).can be dressed up or down.
other Beautiful in pictures and i loved it before i tried it on. as the other reviews state, it is short and wide. i like the top so much, i am going to try to add some gathering across the back to offer some shape. otherwise it is an unflattering shapeless box :(
other This is an exceptionally soft and high quality coverup. i always look for a coverup that could double as a dress so that i can walk into a restaurant without feeling underdressed. i bought the white -- i always buy white it seems, but loved it so much, i came back for the blue. get this and live effortlessly this summer.
other This shirt is just so easy breezy! i got the blue motif and love the pattern. the top is loose but it's supposed to fit that way. i have a feeling this will be my go to for the spring summer! i'm about 136lbs and ordered a small.
other I have the moss colored pilcro skirt that is out right now in an 8 and love everything about it. ordered this in an 8 and it is tight! sending it back. it is very pretty though. just don't love enough to exchange for correct size.
other Love these pants - they are a perfect color, are of a good weight (i sometimes worry that light-colored pants are going to be see through), and fit wonderfully. they are true to size and are narrow down the leg - perfect for flats, boots, booties, or sandals for summer!
3 I usually wear an 8, which wasn't available, and sized up to the 10 which fit just fine as there is no stretch and it's a set-in waist band. the fabric is pretty, the skirt is fully lined, the length is not too short, and the only thing i don't like is the big bronzey toothed zipper - it looks ok on the beige version, but on the black it stands out.it's perfect for summer but i could also see wearing the black version during holidays.
other I have already worn this several times. it is very flattering, lightweight, and easy to wear. dressy but also very soft and comfortable.
other The navy version of these pants are beautiful. the contrast gray stripe is subtle and slimming, and continues through details in the pockets.i am 5'6", 34-26-38 and i wore a size other regular and other petite. the regulars were very long, and even heels couldn't help them. the pant leg covered my foot, covered my toes. the petites were much better (and i rarely order petite). they hit the bottom of my foot with no heels, so i think a heel would make them look right. i'm just not sure if the petite
other This is a great looking sweater. very nice quality and is a great design. can wear with many colors. love the look of this sweater and how it lays with the extra attachment on the bottom of it to make it kinda have a floating and airy look. nice!!!!.
other Love the material and how the back is longer than the front! adds style!
other Super soft and cute. the buttons add a nice touch. the color depicted online gave me pause, but when i saw it in the store it was more of a blue than that what you see in pic. great investment. beautiful sweater. 34c, 65", 13other and the small is perfect.
other The cut of this dress is what drew me to order it, but it is so much more! first, the fabric is more of a raw silk, which is more like a soft linen than silk.. it's also got a very soft lining that feels great on the skin, and it has pockets! love a dress with pockets! i also love that the design is on the front and back. i am 5' 4", 133 lbs and a 36c, and ordered a size 6. it's a little big on the sides, so i probably should've returned it for a 4, but it wasn't big enough to make it annoying o
other Beautifully constructed tank--but the bodice isn't fitted and hangs straight down on me--perhaps better for a full-figured individual (i'm 5' 8", 34b, 120lbs and the xs had no shape on sides). could've been longer too. size of armholes is perfect though (often they gap/show bra).
other The fabric was nothing special (i usually like a cotton/silk blend woven fabric, but this was stiff feeling) and the pattern was cute. but what made me return it was the fact that 1) the rose gold glitter dots are puffy paint. literally. puffy. paint. and 2) the dots were not quite dry on my top when it arrived. parts of the paint came off on my fingers and the top was stuck to itself because of it. i could barely unfold it.i'm sure this could have been cute, but who wants a top that looks lik
other I tried on this dress in the portland, me, store today. so much good to say about it: the wine color is deep and rich, the fabric hand is similar to a heavy weight silk, the cut of the dress so flattering.but, i didn't get it. i am 5'2" and weigh 13other lbs. i can sometimes wear a medium, but my upper arms and hips can require a large, usually petite for proper length. the store didn't have a large (i didn't even realize the dress also came in petite), so i tried on a medium. nice fit through the
other I really wanted to love this shirt. the snowflake and stripe design is really cute, and the fabric is of nice quality. it's a very loose fit, which i would've been willing to work with, but... as mentioned in previous reviews, the shoulder seam rests in an odd place on your upper arm, and there are little bumps in the fabric on the arms that appear similar to what happens if you leave a shirt on a wire hanger too long. it looks like you have nubby little wings coming out of your arms. not attrac
other This tunic is a wonderfully updated look. it's cinched just a tad at the waist which gives it a great line. i paired it with a pair of citizens of humanity crop jeans. terrific look!!
other I wanted to love this dress - and did from the picture online. when it arrived, the black already looked faded and old. also, the embroidery looks like a grandma, but not in a cute vintage way. the fabric is stiff, which causes a boxy, unflattering look. had to return it.
other Absolutely in love with this top. the embroidery and back button detail make for a unique and fun look. light and airy material will be perfect in warmer weather with a cute pair of shorts. i got a size small and it fits perfectly. measurements: 5'4, 135lbs, 32e
other I will preface this review by stating that this item was available only in one size at my local retailer. they have a section of dresses mostly offered online that are in store for you to touch, see, try on and order through the store (which is much appreciated). i am normally a size 0-2/xs in retailer clothes and i will typically order a petite when available. the option my store had to try on was a regular medium which is what i have pictured here.i mostly wanted to try it on just to get a fee
other I haven't worn a pair of levis in ages, and had forgotten how great they are. i have recently lost weight and i have to say they are very flattering. i wasn't sure at first how i would ilike the frayed hems, but they are growing on me.
other I tried this dress on in-store and fell in love with it as soon as i put it on. it's beautifully made, the fabric is soft, comfortable, and free-moving, and overall it has a lovely vintage, romantic look. i actually ended up wearing it for a family photo shoot the next week, and was pleased with how it looked in our photos as well, especially the lovely way the fabric draped. another reviewer said it seemed baggy and oddly-shaped; it does seem shapeless before you tie the waist tie, but once tha
other Saw this tee on line and thought i'd give it a shot - the fit is very complimentary and the material is heavenly! i get lots of raves about the casual yet pretty style too. great shirt!
3 Comfortable and soft material, cute design and nice longer length..however, i'm long waisted and this looked ridiculous on my me, elastic came up right under my bra and not at my waist. would be cute for someone shorter.
other I bought this duster in the blue color and really like it. i am 5'11" so love the longer length. the large was too wide so got the medium. the sleeves were a little snug on my upper arms but after wearing it for awhile they loosened up. i think i will get the white too!
other This skirt is adorable and has a beautiful pattern! it's also extremely comfortable. a total steal at the sale price!
other I love these! they are cute enough to wear out, and they are really comfortable. i ordered a small and at 5'3" they are a little long but they shrunk in the wash and they're still totally wearable
other I tried it on at store and went back to buy it once it hit the sale rack. not the kind of dress that grabbed my attention online, but once i put it on i knew that it would find a way to my closet. the fabric is high quality, and there is lots of it. the color, the weight, the pockets- i love everything about it. i see how it might not work for everyone, but for me (5'7, 13other lb, 36b) xs is a great fit.
other I've had great luck with items from sunday in brooklyn & this vest is another fantastic purchase. the color/fit match the photos. the material is so soft. i've worn it quite a bit since i received it and it hasn't pilled. it's washed well too. the braided part can be folded down if you don't want it higher on your neck. it will still lay flat & drape nicely. it's perfect for cold weather. i'd love to see this come out in other colors too.
other A while back the moss ikat print appealed to me online but sometimes these style tops look maternity on me so i passed up. well abt a month ago i spotted the 'moss' in the store & had to try it! it really is cute & love the print even more in person. the size other was fine but the armholes exposed the bra a little & i wondered if it wld be a little too short after washing. well, the size 6 was a little longer & a tad more flowy, & oddly the armholes covered the bra (the other didn't). i went w/ the siz
other The dress is absolutely beautiful in person. the blue stripes are a bit brighter and the print on top is more muted. it's unique and sure to turn heads. being 5'2" i tried on the small petite. this size is usually perfect (lengthwise) for me. however this dress was about 2" too long. another complaint is the style of the top half. the model in the picture seems to be hiding the puffiness of the top half. the top half puffs out and made me appear much wider than i am. not a good look on anyone.
other This top is lace done extremely well, i love the silk, the double attached layer, and the length. dress it up or down, this top is a definite show stopper.it does run small in the arms though, size up!
other These are such quirky pants! they're a lot of fun, well made and i love the wide, cropped legs. they do run small - though most reviewers say they are true to size. i wear a 4/6 or 28, and in these i had to get a size 10. very tight at the waist, even though the rest of the pant flows easily and is loose. great color, they'll be perfect for spring and fall, and you can probably pair with boots in the winter. just a fun staple to my wardrobe.
3 These are cute and light weight however the fit is off. i ordered my normal size large (i'm a 12/14.). the waist was large but fit ok. they were really tight across the theighs. the crop length is fine with my 5'9 height. if i hadn't got such a good sale of probably return them. they will be good lounge pants.
3 Cute top, not great on me. beautiful, bright color.
other The colors of this top are my favorite part, i want to hold onto summer for as long as possible and this time lets me do that!
other I love this dress but sadly for me it didn't look good on my body type. i'm a 36 dd and not thin so it made me look like a beached whale. i saw it on two different sales clerks in the stoe and they both looked adorable.
other I cannot even tell you how many pairs of white jeans i have tried on in my quest to find white jeans! all brands and all styles and finally i took a chance on these and have found the ones! these are great quality, as true for any ag pants i have ever purchased. they are a crisp white and are not see through and the fit is amazing! i have athletic legs and with my muscular thighs and calves it has been difficult to find a pair of white jeans that didn't hug to tightly and therefore fitting poorl
other Sadly, this shirt was too short for me. i'm 5'11" and have had a hard time with some of retailer's shirts lately. but it is absolutely beautiful and the fabric feels expensive and it's well made.
other The colors are amazing, the fabric is beautiful; my only complaint is the cut. i am 5'8" 130 lb and always a medium. i put the sweater on and the armhole area was short so it kept riding up- it almost fit like a petite with the higher cut in waist tailoring. i liked the sweater color and fabric so much i exchanged for a large.
other I liked the jeans, but exchanges them for ag's stevie ankle jeans due to the difference in length. i love pilcro, but these were just a bit too long on me.
other Gorgeous laser cut top layer in a true vermillion red, oh la la! style is feminine, elegant, and appropriate for all ages.  i plan on wearing this for the upcoming holiday season as well as valentine's day 2017!  quality is top notch and fit is true to size all be it a little snug in the sleeves.  for reference i'm 34e-30-40 and the size 8 worked, i would have like to have tried the 10 but the store only had an 8.  the arms are a little snug, nothing uncomfortable, just snug. length is below kne
other So this dress is absolutely gorgeous! my problem is i am 5'10" and it is very short wasted. between the shoulders and waist and even the arm holes it just plain doesn't work. i think if you are taller this dress just won't work. i have purchased other items from this name brand and have had the same problem.
other Was so excited to get this dress because i thought it was cute and i love flowy and big dresses - however this looks huge. the material is not soft so it doesn't fall well. it just stays proofed out so from the back you look like a giant!!
other This dress is so pretty, comfortable and easy to wear. i got so many compliments in it. it is a winner for sure!
other Unfortunately, this dress did not work for me like the other reviews. i am 5'8, 130lbs, and the dress looked like a tent on me (size s). there was just way too much material at the bottom. also, while the dress is lined, both layers are quite thin- not see through, but i would not call them substantial either. for the cost of the dress and the material, it wasn't worth paying more to have it tailored to fit better.
other This sweater is gorgeous, i wish i could have purchased in several colors because it's now a staple in my closet. downside- it does say delicate cold water wash, but the lace on the back is so delicate and pulling happens on the sides every time i wear it, so dry cleaning is the way to go. the sweater does snag easily, so don't wear anything that could get caught in it (jewelry/handbags with chains or embellishments) because they will catch.
other This dress is very lovely - ivory fits as pictured (slightly below knee) in ivory not as the black is depicted (much shorter). fits a little larger than expected and material is very stretchy.
other So i ordered this because i like amadi dreses in general, and was curious how hte long one would fit. i do love it, it is really comfortable. color is pretty neitral, material is thick enough for fall, california winters and cold spring days. can be dressed up a little with nice heeled booties. i am less than 5'2" (11other lbs if curious# and this worked on me #petite, xs). i say go for it!
other Being other ft, long/maxi dresses are usually not what i buy, but i tried this dress on and it was the perfect length for me. i wear size other or other and i tried on both sizes in store. the other i tried on had a shorter length for some reason than the other (maybe it was a petite and was mislabeled?). i ended up getting the other and i love the dress!
other I have a hard time with jackets fitting because i have chubby arms compared to the rest of me. i like the way this fits and it doesn't pull when i try to cross my arms in front. i feel like it's good quality and hopefully won't flake the way 'vegan' (i.e. fake) leather can. and i think i can throw it over a top with jeans or a dress and it will be cute and versatile. i also like the length that hits right at my hip. i'm 5'2" and don't like when jackets like this are are too long.
other This could worn with anything. tank top, long sleeves, gloves, jeans and pants. very high quality material. will be a staple in my wardrobe this fall!!!
other I love these! they are so soft! the high waist is awesome and fits like a glove. they don't stretch out. i wear with a heel and get tons of compliments. they make my hips look smaller than they are.
other I have been searching for a pale pink sweater for fall. the color and fit is much prettier than the way it is photographed here. i think it will look great over denim, grey, or olive green dresses and shirts.
3 This skirt is not what i was expecting at all. for starters it runs large, i expected it to sit at the natural waist and it is definitely made to do so, but it was a good two inches too big and therefore wouldn't lay flat and gaped at the front. no bueno. my biggest gripe, though, is that the color looks nothing like it does in the picture. they have it paired with an ivory top and the two look like they match so well but do not be fooled, the background color of this skirt is not even close to
other This sweater is one of a kind just like many pieces from retailer. the design is super cute the color is perfect and others dont like the sheer material however for me since it's not see through i really like it. the reason for a return is they sent me the wrong size..ordered a small (i checked my order) and i got a xs petite. so sad since large is the only size left.
other I'm obsessed with this dress.  it's so pretty and love that it has a lining.  i'm 5'1" and got a small, i had dry cleaner take it in from the sides so i didn't look swallowed up in dress and now it's perfect.  still has the swing but not as bulky.   can't wait to wear it out!
3 I tried on the xs petite, and liked it but didn't love. the arm holes seemed big, you could see my pink bra peeked through on te sides. also, the material is soft but thin (see through, somewhat). the xs petite, just seemed big overall, i would try the xxs petite if it goes on sale and is available. i am 11other lbs, 30dd for reference.
other I got both colors as i'm not sure when a style that is so perfect for me will come around again. these are beautifully designed and very slimming. they are described as crops but i am 5'5" tall and the length is perfect, approximately 1/other above the heel of my shoe. no alterations required!!! usually retailer pants are extremely long for me but these citizens of humanity cords are the perfect length. the colors are just as pictured-i was surprised by another review that described the navy as
other The shirt fits loosely, but not baggy. beautiful detail on the back and shoulders. very soft and lovely material.
other I love the look of this tee, casual, but with some interesting details that make it more flattering and wearable than a plain tee. i tried on my regular size xs and it was large and frumpy, so i was initial disappointed. however, when it was on promo i decided to try the xxs, and it made a huge difference. if you size down it is great and looks like it does on the model. i ordered the coral and it is a beautiful color. the dye seems to be uneven, as it is darker in some parts. for this reason i
other Flowy boho tank. great details. good fabric. wear under a long cardigan or with a pair of denim cut offs and a necklace. oversized fit. i would size down one size.
other This sleep is super flattering on but it runs quite small (and short). it has a lot of stretch to the fabric and my normal size felt like i had a large spanx slip on. like i said, great slip but i'd recommend ordering up a size if you want it to look like the model.
other I was very disappointed in the quality of this top. the first time i wore it it snagged right in the front. i had to pull the thread under so it wasn't exposed. i put it in the wash in the gentle cycle and it was destroyed with several more snags when i removed it from the machine. this top is extremely delicate and doesn't withstand normal everyday casual wear although it's s casual lightweight sweater. now it's just a wear around the house ratty throw around shirt.
3 First, i love moth clothing and own many, many of their pieces. this is very cute and i purchased it to go with the jules tank. the other reviewers are spot on with the cute factor and that it runs a little larger than the cropped sweaters. the snails are very cute, buttons run all the way down...caveat: it began to pill after only a having it on a few hours - and i wasn't doing anything to cause extra friction- just sitting and lounging mostly. i noticed pilling on the inside of the arms when
other This sweater totally caught my eye online and when it arrived, it was even better than on the website. gorgeous colors---kind of a retro look, but more modern and updated. very happy with my purchase!
other This is going to be a favorite. the fabric is substantial without being heavy. it has a beautiful drape. this blouse is loose but skims the body closer rather than being blousy. it works perfectly worn with a skirt or pants and belted or tucked but is not too blousy if left unbelted. i purchased the black with the lovely feather pattern. the colors are vibrant. i'm always looking for something black with some color because i tend to wear a lot of black on the bottom. this fit true to size. i am
3 I personally love this romper. there's a lot of fabric to it, so it feels lush and substantial. and the pockets! they're so roomy i actually couldn't find my phone for a hot second. the crotch of the legs (because, yes, this thing is actually pants) is very long and so i was very comfortable sitting.the two things i don't love about this piece include the downfall of all rompers imo: not bathroom-break friendly. you basically have to disrobe. and since the legs are so long, you end up clingi
other This gorgeous dress arrived today. the color is beautiful, but the sizing? way off. i cannot move my arms -- it is extremely snug across the shoulders. but, the rest of the dress is loose, as shown in the picture. if i went up a size to fit my shoulders, i'd be swimming in this dress. so, all you gals out there with anthletic tendencies: beware of this dress. it is for women without shoulders/with tiny arms. too bad. this is otherwise gorgeous & would look great worn over a sexy slip with the bo
other Top fiits true to size- i'm 5''6", 132# and avg bra size. i orderd a other and it is great.i love the colors and the fabric is realy nice- what i would expect for this price point. the slit at the neck is not too low to be revealing. this would work well with jeans and just as well with dress pants for work.
other Found this dress on the sale rack, but the store did not have my size. fortunately they were able to order & ship it free. the colors & fabric caught my eye right away. it reminds me of a vintage apron print, but in a good way. i'm tall with a long torso & ihad to lower the waist tie.
other Love this dress. it is so comfortable. it fits great and can be dressed up or down. hides the tummy, too.
other These pants fit well, are cute, and are comfortable. they are a nice alternative to jeans.
other I just purchased this adorable top at my local retailer store, not really expecting to find anything, i saw this one so i tried it on in my usual size small and it fit me perfectly (34d-27-35). i bought the black with the colorful print and think it's even prettier in person. it looks cute with the ties either open or closed and the material is nice and soft. also, the arm holes aren't too large which is always a nice plus:)
other These pants looked worn, washed & old looking when i received them! the quality is super thin cotton as if it's been washed a million times & is about to fall apart! the workmanship is terrible. you can see loose stitching all over. the top portion is too tight & looks terrible stretched out. i liked absolutely nothing about this pants except the idea of them from the picture online...
other These are as comfortable as any other leggings. they are thick enough that they are not see through (such a pet peeve when i see people with see through leggings). the front panel is so soft and i feel like it gives more of a professional vibe. they are a bit cropped/short but i'm tall so i'm used to this.
other Ok, the material is great, light & airy. the thing they don't show you is the waist line is tucked in the photo, that's why you cant see the bi level hem line. the hem line is fantastic. the waist is the problem, the whole dress just hangs huge from bust down. the material is so light i would caution against darting the dress. i created a button loop cinch under the outside corer of the pockets, on the seem of the waist. this worked for me.
other I was hoping these would be like some of the lace shorts i bought from retailer last year that i loved so much. sadly, no. first of all they run small. i am between a s and xs in most brands, bought a s in these because i like my shorts on the looser side. these felt a little snug and short, but i decided to keep them. the first time i washed them, they were ruined. i followed the directions exactly and even put them in a lingerie bag in the washer, plus a delicate cycle, no dryer. the lace is man
other I loved the colors of this vibrant dress. the beading is fabulous. the dress does run small, i sized up one size. i wore it out and got a lot of compliments
other Great, comfy shirt! long enough that i can wear it with leggings!
other I love this dress! i am 5'3" 117 lbs and ordered the size 0. the fit is excellent and is very flattering. the color is more kelly green than what is shown in the picture, and is lovely. i wore it to my 40th celebration and adored wearing the dress!
other Love the material -- it is a thick cotton, but it is structured enough and thick enough so that it doesn't cling to me (in a bad way). its like wearing a sweater. my only beef with it is that the seam where the black material is stitched to the gray material creates a bump in the silhouette. (the black material is the same as the gray and it also has a herringbone pattern thats not really visible in the pictures) i would have preferred a uniform material rather than a panel sewn in. not a huge d
3 When i read all these positive reviews i did not hesitated, as i wanted good basics which will be good investment in me as looking good is always investment. well, i love blue color as i am blonde wih blue eyes and this color makes my eyes brighter and matches almost everything but..the design of the shirt is made oversize fit basically the shirt should not be dressed as fitted it's more relaxed fit so if you wear medium go head and order medium even if the small fits unless you want to look lik
other I was a bit dubious of the top because online the video of it made the top look frumpy - wide and wrinkled looking. the top seemed shorter in the video than in the pictures. so i wondered if the images were massaged a bit in photoshop. i got it today and it's fully lined and the material is pretty thick which gives it a rich look and feel. i like the top even though it highlights my hips a bit and being pear-shaped i don't normally like that, but being thin helps. the best part of the top is the
other When this poncho first came online i ordered it in the xs/s, my usual size. i was a little disappointed that the point in the front oddly hung low & was off-center. the back was centered. i returned it. when i spotted them at the store recently, i tried on a few in the xs/s to compare & see how others hung. i found that one of them hung fine in the front (centered), the back was a little off center which was fine. it's soft & comfy, love the soft white color & border trim. it's just perfect!
other I bought the ivory in my usual size xs and the fit is flattering and quality is good. it is a good weight for spring, summer and fall. i love that it is a natural cotton/linen blend. the turquoise was not available in my size initially but when it restocked for a short time i ordered it, also! i know i won't be disappointed. beautiful sweater with great details.
other More and more i find myself reliant on the reviews written by savvy shoppers before me and for the most past, they are right on in their estimation of the product. in the case of this dress-if it had not been for the reveiws-i doubt i would have even tried this. the dress is beautifully made, lined and reminiscent of the old retailer quality. it is lined in the solid periwinkle-colored fabric that matches the outer fabric print. tts and very form-fitting. falls just above the knee and does not rid
3 Following the advice of other reviews, i ordered a size larger than normal, since the reviews said runs small in the bust. the dress ended up being much too big everywhere, including the bust.the dress was beautiful and great quality! sad i ended up with the wrong size.
other I am typically a small/6 in dresses, but i should have gone with the other reviewers and sized down. it had no shape, but hung like a paper sack. the armholes fit perfectly though, if i had sized down they may have been too tight. i am 5'6" 140 lbi will return, too bad because it is a pretty dress!
other Following another reviewer's advice, i ordered up to an xl. it's huge. stick with your normal size or go down one. it's a one of a kind piece. soft, lightweight, yet cozy and adorable. sadly have to return mine.
other Listen up gals - buy every color before they disappear!!! this top is amazing. so flattering, incredible fabric, the colors are divine and the price is amazing! i am not one who wears peplum tops often if ever. a coworker of mine spotted this one in our store and told me as soon as i came in. i'm curvy - generally a l or xl on top and i have hips and a toosh. peplums can often either sit on my hips in an unflattering way, or look like a maternity top on me. this one is magic. hits a big longer,
other I picked this dress up off the rack on a whim, and did not expect to love it. i was so delightfully surprised! this dress is made of a lovely, thick, starchy cotton--i found i didn't require a bra. which is great because the back is a gorgeous feature of the dress. the white band across the midsection makes the waist appear small. the dress has sort of a retro feel with the tea length and looks best with heels. i did note a little bit of gaping under my arms but not enough to keep me from buying
other I love this sweater! i have gotten so many compliments. it is so comfortable and unique. i am planning on ordering the same sweater in another color. i wear a small and ordered a small. it fit me perfectly. i shop at retailer for a lot of my clothes because they are well made and different.
other Great summer pants. real wide leg. fit perfect even my muscular thighs. run a little roomy right of the rack but stretch out terribly. in my regular size, they start falling off after few hours of wear. long. dragging on the floor on my 5'7 frame.
other This dress overwhelmed me. i'm other feet tall and the print and material just took over.
other Fun top, 5'4, 13other lbs and i ordered xs. it was too wide and boxy so exchanged for xxs and it fits great. i like the fun slant to the side. not tight on stomach which is great! :) great top.
other This top is extremely well made. the fabric is so soft. the style is very stylish. it is very figure flattering and chic. a keeper! i'm petite and the style is not overwhelming.
other I love this dress! the pattern is unusual along with the mesh cutouts. i'm a sucker for mesh cutouts. it does look a little bit like a maternity dress, but eh, who cares. let them think what they want. i recently wore it to a casual outdoor wedding and received many compliments. i knocked off one star for quality because the back of the dress where the zipper stops needed to be reinforced by hand to keep it from ripping. this is a common problem i have with retailer dresses, and no i'm not trying
other I thought this dress looked gorgeous on the model. so floaty and light. when it came, i found it to be the exact opposite. the hem is so heavy and laid on me like a potato sack. it had way too much material at the bottom and weighed me down unfortunately.
other This dress is effortlessly chic. i wore it with black tights and booties and it was perfection. will definitely be a casual staple year around.
other I ordered this top on a whim and never in a million years did i expect to love it as much as i did. while it is by no means work appropriate, it is a fun top for a night out. the material is light and flowy and it drapes perfectly over my post baby tummy. i tried it on with jeans, shorts and white pants and it really looked great with all items. wish this came in a few other colors. for reference, i am a 36dd and a size 12, took the large and it looked flowy without being maternity topish.
other I picked up this tee in store, where they had a pattern that isn't pictured here (purple floral on a grey background). this is a loose fitting tee, and usually the loose fitting tees i try on at retailer are really unflattering- however, this one fits great and is flattering. the fabric is wrinkle resistant and comfortable. this top will definitely be a staple of my spring and summer wardrobe! considering ordering in other colors.for reference, i'm 5'other 145lbs, 38-30-40 measurements, 34ddd
other This tank runs very true to size. i ordered my usual size 8, which fits like a glove. couldn't go any smaller. very pretty fabric which is lined above the peplum. i personally like the higher peplum, but it's a personal choice. great purchase!
other The design is unique and stands out.  goes great with a black pair of jeans and can be dressed up.  i found the fit to be decent - not unflattering on me. however, i suspect that it could run short / tight on others.overall though - a cute white top for winter.
3 I returned this as it was way too boxy/loose. ordered a size small but probably needed to size down.
other Great dress - fits tts (i am a 6p and purchased a sp). looks good with boots or ballet flats.
other I tried this cardigan on today at retailer and i absolutely loved it! it's much cuter in real life than it looks online. it's a perfect sweater for my skinny jeans--long sweater--tall boots winter uniform.
other The dress is very pretty! i ordered for a wedding and thought it was a little casual for that. in the end i returned because it wasn't very flattering for my figure.
other This tunic could be great but there is some weird construction going on at the armhole. first of all, the armhole is way too low! second, there is a totally unnecessary side seam zipper under the arm. since this is a tunic it slips over the head no problem. no need for the side zipper, it adds bulk and distorts the way the fabric should hang at the side.
other These are my favourite sleep pants. the waist band shrinks with every wash even without drying all the way on low. i normally wear a small and ended up getting the large so the waist band didn't cut in my sides.
other Great sweater - heavy without being too warm. great layering piece.
other My kids gave me this blouse for christmas in my usual size 6. it was so tight through the chest, shoulders and arms. i ended up having to exchange it for at size 10! there was barely any difference in the size 8. unfortunately, i now need to have the sleeves shortened, but as this blouse is so cute, it's worth the effort.
other This product was offered in a pink color which compliments many color palettes. perfect for layering.
other It's a perfect maternity dress but i love that i will still be able to wear it with a belt once the baby comes.
other I ordered this as it was either in stylist pick or top rated, cant' remember which, but i must say, ti was very nice on. a little loose, but the petite sizes are sold out, so i ordered the xs (petite might have been too short...) the cut is feminine, not figure hugging, but still flattering. i can see wearing this in the fall with boots and a cardigan, not just summer with sandals, so i decided to keep it. 11other lbs, 30dd, 26.other in waist.
other This a a great sweater! it is classic, but has the fun surprise element of the lace bell sleeves. loved it so much i got the black and the sea mist. looks great with jeans or leggings! the only negative is you can call it that is that the sleeves are a tad long for me. compliments everytime i wear!
other This is a great winter addition to any wardrobe. warm but not hot. looks great with tights as a dress or with leggings. so many compliments.
other I liked the design and the shirt did fit well enough, but the thin fabric does not justify the price. it looks like it will get holes in it after a wash or two.
other Love, love, love this top. so flattering and forgiving. bought it in white - great for summer!
other I wore this sweater last weekend and received so many compliments. not only is this a very pretty style, the poncho is comfortable. i really glad i purchased.
other I wore it belted with a close fitting cami beneath because the sweater is open down both sides. be creative and wear it different ways.
other I fell in love with these cropped pants & first purchased a size 3other but realized that they do run true to size so i exchanged for a 30. i usually wear an 8-10 pant size.i am so happy with these chinos!
other Really fantastic shirt. ordered multiple colors and will keep them all. the gray especially looks a bit boring online, but is gorgeous in real life. it has different shades mixed together and is really pretty. neckline is interesting. wish the front was a tad shorter, (i'm 5'4) but don't think petite will work. really, really great shirt.
other I got these in gray and ultimately returned them only because i already have a similar pair of pants. they fit true to size and the quality is fantastic. i usually do poorly with pants that zip on the side because of my small frame, but i had no problem with these at all. i may go after the other colors!
other Great pants! i love the style and fit! would highly recommend!
other I purchased this romper over a month ago and love it! i ordered a s and would say that it is true to size. it falls well and i love the blousy look on top. it is expensive at full price, but i purchased it with a promotional discount. luckily, before i washed this (as the tag says handwash only), i read the reviews in which some reviewers had said that they followed the directions and it still shrunk. i let it sit in my hamper until today after i read online about using dryel and rayon. dryel in
other Super cute and comfy, perfect for fall and winter (apre ski!). great with skinny jeans or leggings and ankle boots.
other These were not tts, imo. i am a 10 and ordered the m. they did not look bad, but b/c these have no stretch, they were not comfy, like joggers are supposed to be. i ordered the lg when they went on sale and while they are baggy, the comfort is spot on in the larger size. i got the navy after seeing the irl pics. happy with this sale purchase !
other I originally bought this dress in navy and i absolutely loved it! so i bought a second one in the neutral color. they both fit perfectly and are very flattering! i love how i can dress them up or down. i wear them out to run errands and look cute while being comfy. i also wear them to work! i am an np so business casual is a requirement for office days. when i'm used to wearing scrubs, i hate wearing true dress clothes. these dresses are a happy medium. i only wish my size was available in the t
other Fyi the neck does have a hook and eye closure so there is room to get it on and off. the fabric is not stretchy. the lining is a nice navy. however, the sleeves are not lined. the cut outs have a beautiful blue lace behind it. it hit me at my waist. i'm 5' 3" , 118#. i loved this top. worked with a pair of the new essential skinny trouser by retailer, and the nansen pointelle cardigan in yellow. this also paired well with a pair of rust colored skinny pilcro with a long necklace.
other I love this blouse. it is soft and has nice drape. even though it is very voluminous on the bottom, the true-to-size cut of the arms and shoulders as well as the seaming in back keep it crisply tailored and not overwhelming. thinking about buying more prints!
other I saw this t on sale and ordered it. i had second thoughts, thinking it would be just like a lot of ts i already have. well, i got it today and am thrilled. the fabric is so soft, a sumptuous softness that makes me feel good. the fit is the fit we all want in a great t, nice fit, not too baggy, not too tight, and it is so flattering. it doesn't show off my tummy as so many other ts do. i can wear this with jeans or a skirt. so glad i got it!
other I was pleasantly surprised with this one. fits a bit large. i'm 8-10, the 8 fits just right. the moss is a great staple color.
other If you are curvy, this dress is for you. every details is flattering, from the seams to the fit-and-flare cut. true to size. this dress will easily cross seasons. love it!
other I tried this top on before it went on sale but thought the price was too high. as soon as it went on sale i scooped it up and i'm glad i did. i'm usually always a small in retailer tops and this was no exception. i'm tall and thin with a large bust but this top does not pull or bind in the chest because it's cut on the bias. it is a little low but i've been wearing it for parties. it might be too low for work depending on the setting. i don't usually wear green but this is a very muted and pretty
other I love this top. very comfortable fabric and it can be worn in multiple ways. it is tight on the bottom. i usually wear an xs (5'4" and 120 lbs). had to exchange for a small. very flattering. liked it so much i ordered it in both colors.
other It's exactly how it appears in the pictures-awesome shirt
3 Gorgeous dress, but so low in front and in back...i couldn't figure out how to pull it off without a cardigan/sweater. beautiful fabric and color.
other This suit is so beautiful, and the quality is great. i wanted it to work out, but unfortunately my chest size is not compatible with this bathing suit. i am a 36c and there is zero support (which i assumed when i ordered it, but it was so lovely in the photo i had to give it a try). for those who have a smaller bust, or are more comfortable with a little sexy side profile, this may be perfect. i ordered the large, and the bottoms were a good fit. i am also very petite and the length was good one
other Fantastic top! fits, flatters and falls beautifully! i loved the white so much i went back for the black! i wear with jeans, leggings and with pant suits. lovely with all!
other This is a real cute vest that is also soft and comfy to wear. love it!
other I love this dress and was hoping to get it in more colors. i was bummed when my size xs regular was out of stock. i would've even ordered it in a s regular but that was out of stock too. please get more in...love the deep red color!
other Love this! when i first saw it online, i thought it was a bit pricey for a plain white shirt. but i finally gave in and ordered it! i'm so glad i did! i've worn it twice in one week so it won't be difficult to get my money's worth! it's very soft and fits perfectly. looks great with jeans or dress pants. i like to tuck the front in my pants and leave the back out.
3 After reading other reviews i ordered a small. my usual size is a m. it was huge all around. it's a beautiful print but i think it would make a nice maternity top.
other I almost never take the time to write reviews but this shirt is amazing... it's a super soft, stretchy, substantial fabric that is incredibly flattering. it falls perfectly and is insanely comfortable. i am 5'5" 120 lbs and usually wear an xs or s in retailer tops... i went with the xs and it is a perfect fit. love it so much i bought it in other colors... i am now completely broke but these shirts will be in constant rotation.
other I ordered this in a size other which i thought would be a small and it was very, very wide. it is very short too. i typically wear a small and am 5'8" and 13other lbs. it's going back unfortunately. very soft material though.
3 The fabric is very thin. i have seen this comment on several sundry reviews, but its hard to imagine how thin the fabric is until you see it in person. i could put a cami under it - but it was also rather short on me. i don't usually have trouble with shirts running short and can even sometimes wear petite sizes since i am only 5'4".
other This looked really pretty but i think i am just too short for it. a little on the wider side. would look good on someone taller
other This top is girl-next-door sweet. i'm mad about plaid so it was love at first sight for me! i love a blouse with a touch of spandex because i like the fitted look but not tight or loose, and spandex gives a bit of a yield. size other regular fits me well (i'm 5'2", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), the hem falls at mid hip and the sleeves fall about 1/4" pass my wrist (i plan to wear this top tucked in and the sleeves rolled up since the weather is warmer now). the color honey is versatile, blue motif has a
other I so wanted to love this top. i ordered the "blue", which is blue and orange. i thought the orange would be brighter, it is not. it is a dull color. also, i'm usually a medium, this top fits fine on my shoulders/bust 34c, but it was huge around the waist, making me look a lot larger. if this top were a bit smaller around the waist, i would keep it, but it is going back.
other I bought this dress online last week (in large part based on all the positive reviews), then i saw it in the store. i didn't try it on because it was already on the way to me and i had ordered a petite anyway and the store didn't carry petites. i have to say when i saw it hanging in the store i was disappointed! for some reason i didn't realize it was a sweater dress and it looked frumpy on the hanger. so i had resigned myself to returning it once i received it. well it came today and i figured
3 I'm keeping this top bc it was on sale but it does look a little maternity! i wore with super skinny white jeans and 3" casual heel. i'm short so i needed a little more height to slim me but if your tall and and slender this might work better for you?
other I found these jeans to be more fitted than slouchy. for reference, i'm 5'4" and 160#. i'm heavier thru the hips and thighs and ordered both the 3other & 3other petite (i usually take 3other p in pilcro) and the 3other fit well but was by no means slouchy. however, still very flattering and unique. i had purchased the other pilcro em in 3other p and they did fit looser and i would also recommend that style. always count on pilcro for great fit and style.
other Call my corny but this dress inspires me to run barefoot through the lavender fields in provence.  the flowy layers and dreamy prints are mesmerizing.  fit is ideal for my body type as long as you size down.  i had no weird sagging, bagging or poofiness.  and i love the macrame belt!  i tied it offset to the side but the dress looks good unbelted too.  i purchased the small petite. my stats for fit reference:  5'3" tall, 140#, 36dd, 28" waist, 35" hips, wide rib cage, size m/l tops, size s/m
other Very good quality. love the length of it. i wore it with a belt, since on me without it looked a bit too big. i bought the blue one.
other I love this piece! like another reviewer i did notice a broken button right out of the package but it was so great in every other way that i'm going to keep it and have that mended and the buttons reinforced.i'm 5' 7, 140, generally a size 8/medium, small frame on top but baby growing hips ;) -- i found it tts
other I broke my rule of not buying polyester for this dress, twice (helped by sale price with additional percent off promo). it's mainly the irresistible print, i bought it in both the lovely blue-pink floral and the patterned red. love it. works best when the weather is in upper 60s, with tights and boots, but i think it will also work with bare legs and clunky sandals when the weather is warmer. the fit is loose except for in the chest and shoulders, so don't size down. i do wish the fabric was not
other This top was gorgeous and fit perfectly right out of the bag, with only a quick ironing. unfortunately, the first time i washed it (cold water, hang dry), it shrunk so that it no longer fits across the bust without tape where it was once roomy, is much shorter, and feels rougher to the touch. like another reviewer said (unfortunately, after i had purchased and washed!), i wish the label would have just said to dry clean only, because i regret washing it and would have done otherwise if i had kno
3 This sweater is beautiful, especially in the bordeaux color. the cable knit in varying directions makes it interesting and unique and the length is great for us short waisted ladies. my big issue with this sweater is the sleeves. there really are no sleeves, just arm holes at the same level as the hem of the sweater, so you feel as if you need to keep your arms pinned to your sides to keep from lifting the sweater up to expose your midsection, or pushing the sleeves way up, which then results in
other Cannot believe this is still available and on sale. am 5' 6 1/2", 150lbs, size 1other is perfect. this jacket goes with everything i try it with. it is silky smooth but still has structure. is a softer blue than navy. i love it! this is an absolute steal on sale.
other This blouse is an all season winner.i bought the taupe and can wear it with or without a cami, under a sweater. alone, with skirts, pants, jeans. i am 5'7, 135# and a medium was perfect although i normally wear a small.
other This is a great summer maxi dress. i am 5'4" 120lbs, about a size other in dresses, 32dd. i got this in an extra small. i was really happy that on someone my height, it's just a few inches above my ankle, so did not shorten me at all. the straps were a good length, and the waist hit at the right spot. i don't think the waist detail not going all the way around is a big deal, there are the little snaps in the straps for your bra, and skirt is lined. the turquoise color is really pretty and the fabric
other First of all i love retailer, i am 67 yrs old and my whole closet comes from the store. this jacket is way cute. the color is very nice and the fabric is nice. only complaint is i wish the cuffs were just a bit tighter/smaller.
other Absolutely gorgeous top! i have purchased so many retailer tops and this is the 1st review i have ever written. this top is just that deserving for a review. stunning in so many ways. i am 5' 2", 118 lbs and purchased a size 4. fits perfectly. maybe runs a tad small. can not wait to wear!
other Great casual jacket! it's a nice spring weight, can be worn in different ways by turning the cuffs, folding the collar, wrapping or unwrapping, etc. i love the way they styled it in the model shots. i am going to have to disagree with the other reviewers about this being tts. i have to say the medium was so oversized, it looked like i was wearing a fabric box. i have a broad back and 36ddd bust and am comfortably wearing the size xs.
other This top is exactly as described. it can be casual with jeans or dressed up for evening wear. i would have kept it but it was slightly tight across the chest. i am 5' other 1/2" tall, 11other lbs & purchased a petite small. my bra size is a 34a.
other After seeing this top in the catalog i also spotted it in the retailer store. the peach color is even more perfect in person and compliments my skin tone perfectly. the style of the top is unique and flattering. now that i see even more colors, i'll need to buy more. my one reservation is that the material is super soft but very thin, so i hope it doesn't get holes - i want to wear this one all summer!
other This top is fabulous! the color is amazing and the back is just beautiful! i would recommend this sweater to anyone i absolutely love it! my only concern is getting it snagged on something other than that it's a score!
3 What a let down. this is not what i would call a coat but a sweater. it is unlined and very lightweight. the fit was cute and would have been so great if it was actually a coat.
other I love this dress. will be wearing it for the first time tomorrow. it fits well. the neck line is a bit low on me. i think it would look best on someone with more of a chest than i have. i will be wearing a winter white infinity scarf with it (as shown on model). i am 5' 6.5" and 120 lbs and the small is just right.
other The design is very strange. the inner slip is quite form-fitting, but the dress on top was just massive, like a sack. on the sides were tassels that i could not figure out what to do with. they looked weird just hanging off the side, so i tried to knot them like a belt. overall, this dress was not attractive on. it looks much better on the model. the coloring on the snakeskin print dress is also different in real life, harsher red, blue, and white print not the dusty rose and plum pictured.
other This is one of those 'i need one in every color' kind of shirts. need - not simply want. it is very well constructed. the fabric is the perfect weight and is sooooooo comfortable. the raspberry is a little more dusty rose than pictured online, but it works. i've only had the shirt a couple of day. in addition to wanting to wear it every day, the fabric has not pilled. i'm short-waisted, and i have not had any issue with the high-low hem or cropped length.
other This top is really pretty. the fabric is soft and flowy (not too boxy) and the elastic at the top is comfortable. it does not ride up or fall off the shoulders, which i've found with tops of similar design. in my regular size s (5'6 - 125lb), i didn't find the sleeves tight like others have mentioned. one thing i did notice was that the hidden straps that many other tops and dresses have (the ones for hanging on a hanger) are sewn right on the edge of the upper elastic making them pop up a bit.
other These literally are more comfortable than sweatpants. they are definitely "relaxed" and look a little baggier on than in the photo, but still cute and flattering.
3 I ordered the dress online and found it to be not as pictured.  the length hit several inches above the knee.  the sleeves are also 3/other length rather than full length as pictured.  i found the cut to be much less fitted through the torso as well.  i tried both the small and xsmall, which are my usual sizes.  the small was very loose through the torso, the xsmall was better, but looked overall too short, as if it were a petite cut.  i am 5'9", however the model is supposed to be 5'10".
other This is a very cute dress! the sweater material is not itchy at all. i love the bell sleeve and how the seam at the top of the bell matches up to the waistline of the dress. good quality and well made. i am 5' 9" tall and this dress falls just above my knees. so for me, it's the perfect length. i bought the black dress and i look forward to wearing it throughout the fall and winter.
other I just bought this dress in the store and i love it. i'm in my 50s and it does every thing i need a dress to do. it has sleeves, it's modest enough and shows my shape. the colors are great and go with most shoes. i'm heading to italy soon and this one will see me through many museums and churches. great buy!
other I ordered both colors, but ended up keeping the green in petite xs b/c the red in xs was just slightly too big. both colors are gorgeous, and i agree they have a retro 70's vibe. just a tad itchy, but not enough that it would make an undershirt absolutely necessary. i'll probably just wear it alone. i think the regular size would work for most petites b/c it's not ridiculously long. i would suggest sizing down in regular if you're petite though: for instance, the regular xs fit noticeably larger
other The top is cute, but when i received it, it did not feel like cotton. the tag says 100% viscose. i hope retailer can be more accurate with fabric content in the future! on the plus side, the return was no problem.
other I had been admiring this dress for over a year and finally treated myself to it for the holidays. first, it is gorgeous and very thoughtfully designed to make you look amazing. where things fall off the rails for me is the fabric choice for the sleeves...they are sooo delicate and evidently snag far too easily. the dress that i received in the mail had two large snags (one in each sleeve) that were already running a bit. to me that was a huge red flag that i shouldn't be spending so much money o
other I bought the dress in navy stripe in december and it became a favorite, so i jumped at the opportunity to buy the "blue" (pink/purple/blue/black stripes) when it went on sale. this dress is very flattering and feminine, i love the fitted top, fitted sleeves with a cute button detail, and the asymmetrical hemline. i use the navy for work, whereas the colorful stripey one is fun on the weekends. it washes well and holds shape (i hang it to dry). i like it best with boots, but it would work with fl
other These pants are amazing. they are so comfortable and fit true to size. i typically wear a 28 or 29 depending on the pants and the 28s fit me perfectly. i bought the olive green pair and they are everything i have ever wanted in a pair of olive pants. i love that they are tighter in the butt area and loose in the knees and calves so they are not restrictive. i want every color!
other I saw this in the store and had to try it on. luckily i grabbed a couple sizes before heading to the dressing room since i thought it looked large but wanted to get the best look. i normally wear a large in most retailer items and if you want a really roomy look you could go for your normal size but i liked it a little more fitted and ended up getting a small. i plan to wear it over jeans or leggings. the delicate embroidery and details are so pretty. the stick out sides look a little funny but if
other I love the cut of these pants! i'm very curvy and the high waist and wide leg is perfect for me. these hang off the hips beautifully. i'm 5'2" and the petite is perfect with heels. i didn't have to hem them. the one drawback is that they get very static clingy which is frustrating. i wear them with a cream tie blouse and wedges. they're really comfortable.
other The quality of the shirt is top notch. the fabric is lightweight and comfortable.now the cons:this top is cut like a square and fits wide which is not apparent in the photo. definitely not for me.
other Really striking. even prettier in person. color is beautiful. told my husband this is a half-way-to-christmas present!
other I wasn't sure i would like this top, but wanted something different, than what i already own. i ordered it in an xs (my usual size) and it is slightly loose (which i knew it would be based on the cut). it looks great with jeans or shorts. i purchased the black and white striped one because it looks more interesting. the ties may drive me crazy- we'll see. i like the weight of the fabric, i just hope it doesn't pill. for reference, i am 5'3 and 123lbs. i usually wear a 2/4.
other I bought the orange version during the tag sale and was so pleasantly surprised when it arrived. it fits very well and is made from thick, high quality material. i only wish they had more colors! sizing--i bought the 2p and it fits well, although a 0p may have fit better. the dress is fairly low cut on me, although i am small chested, but i wouldn't feel comfortable wearing it to work.
other I finally found this dress in store today and wow! i cannot believe this cheap looking dress is from ms! they have been among the top at retailer and this unlined, baggy, cheap velvet sub is a shock! what happened? only the color is nice. please get back to yourself ms!
3 I ordered this in a small petite. with tracy reese i never really know what to expect in terms of sizing. i'm other ft tall about 118 pounds. i'm in between a other petite and a 6 petite depending on the brand, broad shouldered, slim hipped and very short waisted. i found this dress to fit a little large. it was quite shapeless on me though i did like the wide scoop neck.i'm sending this back sadly. quality is nice, though a bit thin for winter time.
3 This tunic is simple and well made. it was not as long as on the model as on me but i am 5'-9".
other I saw this online and ended up driving over an hour to pick it up from a neighboring retailer store that had other more left in my size! it fits true to size for me with the waist band fitting my 27" inches perfectly with no real give- so keep that in mind. the top does seem a little blousey, which i typically avoid (34d already) but this was still super flattering. overall it is a gorgeous dress that looks good on- one of those dresses that makes you feel good wearing it!
other Appears much more sleek in the photograph. in real life, this shirt looks more like a pajama top. thin, extremely casual, not worth the price i paid- even in black. will be exchanging it tomorrow.
other I can't decide on these pants. after trying them on in the store, they are very soft and a beautiful blue color. however, i found them a bit small. i usually take a l in retailer pants, and these are very tight. probably could pull them off with a tunic top, however, in spite of the fabric, the fit was just not comfortable for me. a good alternative for denim if you are slender, rather than curvy.
3 I ordered this in size xl and it ran small. i'm a pear-shape and thought this style would be flattering. i have a few other peplum-style sweatshirts from retailer that are my favorites. but, the cut on this is tighter so the bottom layers gap and don't flow well. i found it to run short too. it's cut one size too small. i would have sized up but, being xl, there's no option for that. i'm returning mine.the applique is done well and is cute. the colors look the same in person.
other I am usually a regular xs with retailer tops. i took a chance and went with the xxs in blue and am not regretting it. super comfortable top. fits perfect and will be great for work.
other I ordered the coral, size small, it's a beautiful peach color and the linen is very soft. it is longer, and roomier in the waist than i was expecting, however, with skinny jeans it looks great. the detail makes this top very eye-catching, i'm very happy with my purchase!
3 It is a very pretty bra. light weight and beautiful lace. however, i have yet to find a t-back that does not make me feel like i am going to spill out. to me it ran small. i now know to get a 3other instead. i am working on losing weight, perhaps that might help with the fit?
other Never want to take this tee off, so comfy, & neutral, ecru stripe, with a teeny bit sparklecolor is superb! goes with a ton of items from my own closets! need more in every color/print/stripe......just feels ooh, soooo good
3 I ordered this on-line. while it fits well before washing, the fabric is a bit thin. i'm afraid it might shrink in the wash, too. i haven't worn it yet because i'm trying to decide it i will keep it or return it. colors are a bit more muted than i would like also.
other I usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops, ordered this top in an s and it was so wide on the sides and huge it fit like a tent.  not even remotely flattering.  i thought about ordering it in an xs, however, i could tell the xs was still going to have way too much fabric.  back it goes.
other My friend and i bought the same dress we love it so much we get so many compliments great purchase
other I love this dress. i read the reviews on it before i purchased and they were spot on. i have broad shoulders so i ordered the large. it was still plenty roomy but i wore a royal blue sweater with it and it pulled the waist in just enough to make it fit without a belt. i would buy it again!!
other Great style and quality. however sizing runs smaller than anticipated.i gave it as a gift to a friend who wears a smaller size than me.
other 36dd, 10/1other in tops, 12/1other in bottomsthis tank is amazing! the flowing a-line shape is very flattering. the armholes are perfect - all too often i see a good tank top ruined by large, gaping armholes. no bra peek-a-boo here! fabric is a stretch micro-rib knit that doesn't cling too tightly, just enough to give the top good definition. i took the size large for the length - just past the hips on me. the side slits keep the look flowy. the light blue contrast color is light grey, while the brigh
other I love this dress! it is a very casual and loose fit, which makes it super comfortable. i highly recommend it since it is versatile for fall and spring and can be styled quite a few ways.
other This dress is so cute. i love that it has pockets. it looks great with sandels, and also ballet flats. it is airy, and run true to size. i wear a small, and it fit perfect. i even bought the other navy, and cream dress. you will wear this dress over, and over. just roll up the sleeves, and throw it on, and your ready. just love it!!!!
other I ordered these in the pinkish color, and i love them! i'm 5'8" 140 lbs. and the size small fits perfectly. they are definitely sheer, but they're advertised as a cover-up so that was expected. these will be super cute paired with a bathing suit top - bikini, bandeau, or even tankini. the price is great, especially for the type of pant and detailing with the pom poms. no pockets is the only negative.
other I can not speak highly enough about this shirt. i originally bought the navy one and then went back to purchase the other two colors. the material is soft and thin without being flimsy. the fit is very flattering.
other Bought this in pink for a wedding this summer. the dress detail is noted as a "swing silhouette" & should be perfect for twirling on the dance floor. the bit of orange under layer peaking out from underneath is just the right amount of contrast to the bright pink. a pair of heels will make this dress look perfect!
other Yes these are a true clear red. not neon red or orange red, but a classic shade of red. these pants are so comfortable with just the right amount of stretch. they are a nice weight for spring/summer without being too light or flimsy. they remind me of j crew martie but i like these better. i'd say they fit tts if not slightly on the large side. for reference my waist is 26 and hips are 35. the size 0 fits very well but the 2p were too big. ( i also take a 0 in the martie but those are slightly m
other I love this piece and have bought it for three different clients as well as myself... it runs a size larger - i am usually a other and the other fits perfectly. the skort was one size off for my clients too. definitely a great choice for spring/summer, especially if you love to dress up but lead an active lifestyle!
other I found this dress to be a perfect flowy fit for the super-hot tail end of summer. this definitely is not a form fitting dress, but i bought my regular size medium (size 6) and think it fits perfectly. i have a pretty small chest and find that sometimes these a-line dresses look better if you don't have a lot on top making them "tent out". just my opinion. personally do not think it has an abundance of fabric. in fact, it is a lot less roomy than a lot of others in this cut due to the embroidery
3 Definitely was disappointed in the fit of this potentially very cute shirt. just too large; too much fabric for me. i'm usually an xs and there was just no shape to that size for my small bod. i wouldn't have minded the longer length if there had been a better fit up top. i think the colors are also a bit duller in person. love the concept though!
other I loved this top but it runs small so i had to send it back, unfortunately.beautiful styling and color blocking. just wish there had been a larger size available to have been able to exchange for.
other I'm a new mom, and am thrilled at the structure and quality of this dress. it gives me a great shape, very flattering. i can wear it to work with a jacket or dress it up with jewelry for a fancier event.
3 Love the cut and the way they drape. size 26 and 5'6" 135lbs fit great until you wear them for an hour. all of a sudden my 26s became 28s. they were practically falling off. i plan to wash them to see if they shrink. i wish they held their shape since they are so cute.
other This top is well made for the price! the colors are beautiful and will work well with jeans and a leather jacket if it is cooler.
other Since there were so many colors to choose from and the 20% full priced items sale was going on, i went in person to retailer to check these great dresses out. glad i did! online i was torn between several prints, but in the dressing room, there was a clear winner for me (just for personal preference. the prints are still all great!). these dresses are so flattering and comfortable. great with a cardigan or jacket for work or sandals for the weekend. definitely tts. i am pretty much always a m in e
other Just bought this top in the black at my local retailer and i love it. it fits well, not too large and "tenty". it actually fit me under the arms, too. usually, retailer tops tend to run huge, not this one. i love that it is easy to layer with a long boyfriend cardi or a more structured jacket. i'm 5'3" 110 pounds and took the xs. i would definitely recommend this top!
other Beautiful, unique design. it's very flattering the way the fabric hangs.i usually wear a 10, but because the lining is much smaller than the dress (which many linings are... it's a pet peeve of mine), i sized up to a 1other and took in the shoulders a couple inches so the bodice area would sit correctly on my bust. otherwise in the 10 my stomach would feel squeezed even if it looked like it fit perfectly. that said, i'm very sensitive to that kind of thing.other reviewers have noted that the emb
3 This top is gorgeous in both detail in color. it fit great and true to size, but then i hand washed it as instructed on the label and it shrank substantially to the point that it's now too short and needs to be returned.
3 Cute. i love the button back detail. but it's completely see-through. i could have worked with that by putting a cami underneath, but the arm holes were too tight. didn't look bad, just felt uncomfortable. you can't really tell in the pic, but there's elastic on the arm holes. it'll work if you have super skinny arms, but apparently i don't.
other If you're very small-framed and/or petite, i would size down in this. unless you want a really slouchy look and fit. ----------i have very broad shoulders and very large biceps, and typically wear a m/l in retailer tops. sometimes if a top is a pullover style (as opposed to button-down) i have to size up to a 1other to get the top to accommodate my shoulder width and biceps. so i was leery the size 8/italian 4other would fit, but it does, with room to spare, albeit it is not as loose or long in the ar
other Like the other reviewers experienced, i received my top in the mail, and it does not have the straps as shown in the online pictures. not to say that the top is not attractive, though, and i'll be keeping it. very comfortable and cool in the triple-digit heat in my community.
3 I bought this shirt in white and am happy with the fact that it's not too sheer. the back detail is great. my only complaint is that it is too long. i got the small and it fits nicely in the arms and top, but it is much longer on me than on the model. i'm 5'5" tall. it doesn't look great when i do a half tuck, but it looks fine if i tuck it all the way in. maybe an xs would have been a better fit.
other Beautiful top and beautiful bright color. this does run other sizes small in arms and chest unless you are very narrow in stature and flat chested . i am usually a size 6 and a 36c and broad shoulders and size 10 just its in underarm area. i have short torso so love the length but those with very long torso may find this blouse too short. if you get the right size this topics really adorable. my husband also gave it a big thumbs up.
other I never write reviews but this dress is so fantastic i felt compelled to write one. it has unbelievably gorgeous detailing, from delicate beading and sequins on the bodice to the three layers of the skirt: slip, floral pattern, pleats. i literally feel like a princess/ greek muse in this dress. can't recommend it enough. true to size; i'm 5'7" and 133 lb and got a size 4.
other Cute cute. simple tank with a little something to add interest.
other I love this dress. very comfortable. soft? absolutely!
other This is a gorgeous dress. the color is absolutely stunning and looks true to the photos online. the dress is a little too short and tight for a work dress, but too thick for a summer dress. it would be perfect for a date night, but since i have enough date dresses, and not that many dates...i opted not to purchase. it is gorgeous but i would suggest sizing up because i could barely zip in my standard size and the seams would definitely give after sitting.
other I purchased this in the yellow xs. it is very comfortable, but extremely see-through. you'd have to wear a slip or something underneath it, but i'm not sure what would work based on the style, and even if i wore a strapless bra it was still see-through. unfortunately i had to return it.
other I love this dress! it is beyond flattering! i tried the south shore dress on earlier this year but found it too short for my taste. this however.. is the same cut on top, but longer in the skirt! yes, please! i purchased the turquoise, which is exactly as pictured! just beautiful! hits at my shins. for reference, i'm 5'6", 136 lbs and ordered a size small.
3 I really wanted to love this. sadly, the first thing i noticed was how tight it was in the arms and across the back (size up maybe even two sizes). secondly, it's see through! a top like this looses it's finesse to me once i can see my pant line and bra. it's very difficult to do the three buttons in the back yourself and finally, good luck taking it off without getting make up all over the neckline. someone dubbed it the "poor man's pineapple top." i couldn't agree more, sigh. i really did want
3 I wanted to love this dress as it would have been perfect for a wedding i have in october however, the fit was awful;. the dress was heavy with a funky liner. it also had these little black straps around the top of the arm/neck that looked out of place. it ran true to size but i have a large chest (32dd) and it was pretty fitted around the area but loose everywhere else. sadly, dress had to be returned.
other I bought the pink, which is a vibrant but not neon shade of deep reddish pink. love it. i love how the flutter of the sleeves is balanced with a slimmer fitting body, which keeps it from looking frumpy. i did order a size down to achieve this look. i prefer a more tailored look so this suits me while satisfying my desire for a little whimsy now and then. my only issue is that it's too low cut. trying to decide if i just need to wear it with a lower-cut bra or if this requires a cami. i hate laye
other This dress is very flattering. great unique dress.
other These jeans are very unique thanks to the embroiding. would have perferred colorful embroiding though. they are boyfriend cut, but not slouchy. just a bit loose even around athletic legs. they run true to size, but have a lot of give. after wearing them for a a little bit i catch myself pulling them up a bit. if you want a snug fit and are between sized i would go down a size.
other I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this shirt. it's comfortable, the fit is excellent and flattering, and it can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. i bought it in the brown and the black and have no regrets.
other I love this tunic in the carbon color on the model. the color does look different in person, more of a lighter gray. on me, the tunic runs very large. i am usually a small or medium but took the extra small in this and still have room. i agree with the other reviewers about the pockets. they do add bulk in the hip area so if this is a problem area for you, i'd avoid this tunic. overall, it's a nice tunic for everyday wear. the tie-neck adds a nice detail and makes the tunic stand out. it looks g
other This sweater is so cute and classic and i've gotten so many compliments it's so gorgeous the wool is sooo warm 10/10 recommend
other I was able to try this one on at the store, and it was so loose on me, i assumed it was a large, but no, it was a small! (i usually wear size 6-8 in dress size, s/m in tops) admittedly, it does pull over the head, with no zippers or elastic to give shape. but it feels like water on the skin and has just the right amount of "show it," plus coverage for wearing around the house, i'm keeping it.
other This shirt is not near as nice as it may look the fabric is just ok it runs large i ordered a xs and the neck line was huge and gaping not worth the money even on sale
other Bought this on sale and wore it to work yesterday with black skinny pants and leopard flats with a big gold necklace. i'm busty and have to be careful with peplum styles, but this one does well.
other Love love this sweater/shirt. i have worn it out to dinner and work with leggings. it is soft and comfy. the pleats in the back are beautiful and do not require constant ironing. i even bought it in the pink.
other I love this dress. i agree with the other reviewers that the rhinestone linkages do very easily get caught on the lace part of the dress and i could see it snagging very quickly. that said, i am going to keep it and hope for the best because it is absolutely gorgeous. it is not actually a true white as it looks pictured. instead we, it is more of a nude color, but it adds to the flattering nature of the dress and makes it look sheer. the embroidery is beautiful. my only complaint is that it will
other This is so pretty and 60s like. i tried on a return size other and it really fit. i am usually a zero so i was surprised. the regular size fit me really well. length was perfect. pretty heavy and substantial though. love the 3 d effect. 11other lbs. 30 dd. 26.other in waist
3 Dress caught my eye on the rack so i thought i'd try it on. the dress has lovely blue stripes (hard to discern in the online photo) which makes it a great year-round piece. however, like others have commented, it is too low to wear to work. will consider alternations to close the v-neck if the dress is marked down beyond its current sale price.
other This top is so cute on. would look great on anyone as the style, quality, and color is incredible. highly recommend, even at this price. you won't regret it.
other From the moment i saw this top i knew i had to have it. the colors of the embroidery are just so beautiful. it is even prettier in person than it is online!!
other I'm 5'3" and 110 lbs. i usually have a hard time finding pants or leggings that are short enough and fit just right. i ordered an xs, and these fit like a glove right away and i was so pleased! i ordered the brown and blue motif. i have only received the blue so far but love them. they hit just right at the ankle and aren't too loose at the bottom. it seems like they are made well but will wait until after the first wash. i'm someone that wears leggings all the time but love that these look like
other This blouse looks even better in person. it fits true to size and is lightweight. i am not a huge fan of designs on shirts and usually stick with solids but i find this design to be very flattering. i just bought it today but i know i will get a lot of use out of it.
3 This dress has gorgeous fabric and impeccable quality construction! i'm 5'other 118lbs and large busted (32. dd). i am usually an overall size other but when buying dresses usually have to purchase a six to accommodate my chest. i ordered a size other because that was the only size left and was going to take a chance . it fit perfect across the chest but the overall dress is enormous! does not even slightly silhouette your figure. it is like a giant stiff triangle. i was going to return but was so hesitant
other I have still not decided if i am keeping this dress. i sized up according to the other reviews. i typically wear a 6, so i got an 8. it fit me just fine on top, but i am a 36b, so fairly small. because of the photos, i expected the dress to be a-line and flare out at the hips. it did not, that that's why i am unsure. i'd like it to flare out a little more than it does. it would be more flattering and more comfortable. i love the dress otherwise. i think i may take it to a tailor and see if there
3 As a petite, big busted woman, i found this dress wildly unflattering. the quality and pattern of the dress itself is beautiful, though it will require a slip as it is completely transparent. the design of the bust however, i found unflattering.
other I really like the pilcrow denim military jacket. fabric is comfortably soft, but the jacket is still structured. love the tie detail in the back and the contrasting sleeves. i wear either a small or medium. i tried both sizes with this jacket and decided on the medium to allow for an extended season wear.
other I am simply mad about this dress. i am smaller on top with larger hips. my bust is a mellow b but i could see this working on a or c cups also. this dress is extremely flattering for my body type and the bodice fits like it was made for me. it fits fine without a bra and just perfectly with a semi padded strapless. i got this dress to wear to a summer wedding. the texture and color are beautiful and i will pair with simple jewelry and nude heels. it's a great find and excellent quality. definite
other Love the color of this- a rich, dark green- it is super cozy and perfect to throw a long sleeved shirt under- it is roomy, not fitted. i ordered a small, then thought i should have ordered an xs,- so then i ordered an xs as well. i go between xs and small, but because this is not fitted, the xs is perfect. material is nice- soft and super cozy.
other I saw this top and loved the pattern. meadow rue is one of my favorite brands for tops at retailer. the pattern is lovely and the fit it tts. this top is comfortable for running errands and can be dressed up too. very versatile for spring.
other Love the fit of this top, love the design. it does fit a bit small which was a pleasant surprise considering the sizes don't go as small as i usually have to. i got the smallest size and its pretty tight. its a revealing/low cut top, which is great for minimal tan lines. negative- threads are coming out all over after one wear. but i love it so much i will probably order again once it falls apart.. not so great considering the price though.
other Love this skirt. i love that it is pleated and sheer on the bottom. i'm so happy i found it online! love anything maeve, you can count on the quality and simple elegance.
3 How can some reviewers say this jacket is true to size, yet others say it runs small? i think it's because this jacket is cropped. by the time i took advantage of the fall perks 20 percent discount, the xs peach was sold out so i ended up ordering size s. i also got the xs gray to compare. sure enough, the xs looks better but is cropped on me. for ref, i'm 5' 5", 32a, 11other lbs. i don't really need another almost black jacket so i'm either sized out or have to exchange for xs peach to wear with dr
other I'm not sure i understand the negative reviews either. the fit for me was perfect and i saw another lady try it on with a very different body type from mine and it looked great on her. the colors are gorgeous and i am in love with the fact that it has sleeves. maybe i am of an age where i don't always want my arms showing but it is so refreshing to have some choices in retailer of dresses with sleeves. i also appreciate that the slip underneath is a great stretchy material and not the stiff polyes
other I loved this top even more in person! it is made well and beatiful! the sheer under layer adds a sexyness to the design. the back of the shirt is open. i really like this detail!
other I thought i would need a medium in this top, but it was sold out so i crossed my fingers on a small. it fits very well, much like it fits on the model.. loose and length is good ( and i am not as slender as that model!). i am 5'6", 140 lbs). the sweetheart neckline dips a little more than i would like in the front....but i will figure that out. the top is really unique and i love the shimmery dots.
other This dress is incredible! let me say that when it first arrived, i was terrified that i looked like a got tangled in my grandma's curtain. the print was really overwhelming for my living room. however, i went with my gut and wore this dress for our engagement photos out in the woods. not only was in incredibly flattering, it photographed better than i could have imagined. wouldn't recommend wearing this grocery shopping but this is a perfect for a special occasion!
other I was specifically looking for a nice pair of high-waisted jeans and this pair fit the bill. i am a little unsure about the unfinished hem hence the other rating on design, i would have preferred a finished hem. i am 5'4" and they are a tad shorter than i normally like to wear my jeans. i have had them for a couple of days, still deciding whether to keep them despite the fact that i really love them other than these two issues.
other I waited so long for a small petite to come back in stock and finally it did...received the dress last week and it's beautiful it was a perfect fit for me not to big not too small (my size 5'3"/122lb). if you're petite or very thin probably size down. i gave it other stars because of the quality...some of the eyelets looked a little weathered. it is lined and there's no see through. agree with other reviewers though - this dress is not worth $228 price tag.
other Love love this! i was hesitant to buy this at first - the reviews made it seem so big and i wasn't sure if it was my kind of outfit. but i wanted to try a jumpsuit and this was the perfect find! the xs was a typical retailer size for me, so the size was good in this, too. the color is fabulous and the fit is great. the rise is slightly short, but not a problem. i can't wait to where it for my next great event. i wish i could buy it in the black, too.
other Oh my gosh do i love this jumpsuit. i am so glad that i bought it. it is beautiful and fits perfectly. classy and beautiful and made in the perfect color. the design is slimming as well.there is nothing that i would change about it. i may be wearing this for my 60th birthday this month and am sure i will be getting it out for other occasions in the future. i love it.
other I love this top soooooo much! i love straps and i love tops that will show some of my sports bra in the back, since i tend to buy some that have some strappiness. i love that this top has it all-it is lightweight, and it has some character so it is more attractive than an everyday kind of workout top. it is comfortable, even for classes like body pump where you are constantly moving your arms. i love that the colors are not bold, i am sick of neon!!!!
other I love this dress. i am wearing it for thanksgiving! i bought the black because the red was sold out, but would definitely buy more colors. true to size. i'm 5'6" 13other and bought the 6. only issue is i have to wear a slip underneath because it's not lined and a tiny bit low cut for me.
other I just saw this in the store and had to pick it up. i just love this green color and can imagine it going with a number of different types of tops/dresses. i personally think this looks best with a chambray button down shirt with this vest over it, paired with slim fitting black pants and boots.
3 I bought this in size xl and the overall fit matched the model's photos. the neckline was a bit higher than pictured. the material was pretty in person. the problem was the material's threads were too scratchy. i was uncomfortable with that scratchiness against my neck so i returned it. i did like the unique leaf pattern of the lace.
other I went with my instincts and grabbed a size l as opposed to my usual medium.  fits great and flatters the girls while hiding my meaty back!  such a great artistic design, i will love wearing it this weekend.  i am scared to wash it, i may just have to dip it in lingerie powder and drip dry.  for fit reference: 140#, 36dd, i hold my weight in my neck, shoulders, back, upper arms, tummy (i'm not a gorilla.)
other I am so glad i tried this on last minute in my store... it was on a tbale and saw it no hte stylist picks so decided why not try it on. i thought i would need a petite, but hte elngth of the regualr hit me almsot one inch above my knee, which is a sweet spot for me. petite may hit me too high to be able to pull ths casual style at work, (and i wear character shirts with jeans or joggers on the weekends)... so i ordered the 0 for me (the store 0 had a stain on it :-( i am 11other lbs for referenc
3 I'm pretty disappointed in these. just bought the yellow pair and wore today for the first time. super cute and very comfortable. i was in love with them. they got two small stains on them from the day's activities ( and not even crazy, untreatable stains). unfortunately, the stains did not budge yet the color of the shorts washed out. they are completely ruined after one washing (on cold). i'm hoping this was a fluke and plan to order a second pair before they sell out. these will be going back
other I agree with other reviews; this shirt is more like a thin sweater. it is so soft. i was walking around the first time i wore it asking people to pet me. i just got it on sale and wore it twice this week already. i've gotten so many compliments. i bought this on sale in grey. i love it so much that i just bought a navy and burgundy one too. it runs slightly large, but i like my comfortable sweaters to fit large. definitely an important staple to any wardrobe.
other Thanks for the tip to size down. i am typically a m or a l (36d) and i sized down to a s. it is perfectly structured and warm and soft and beautiful. got it on the 40 percent of sale items so the price was right. absolutely a classic. i got the plum color. thanks retailer for another wardrobe staple.
other Love how breezy this shirt is and adds unique texture & detailing to your outfit. the simple black color is a nice touch so the color does not compete with the detailing.
other I'm so happy i purchased this cardigan!! every time i've worn it i've actually gotten compliments, from both women and men:) i was slightly undecided at first due to it's quite pricey, but i think the quality is amazing and the pattern will actually last a long time as a keeper, not just a quick trend!! i'm so happy i snagged it before it ran out!!\ i have quite muscular upper arms, and the medium fits me well. the sleeves do have some give in them, and even though i'm also broad across my shoul
other The cut is on the boxy side and i'm not sold on the tiered effect, but i love the silk fabric and the print so much that i just don't care. the silk is deliciously light and breathable, and the print is neutral enough that i can pair it with several different cardigans and necklaces to mix it up. and the quality of construction is excellent--all of the seams were expertly sewn and pressed, and the print was lined up like in the online picture. given the material and construction quality, it's de
other I wanted to comment about the wash. yes, these jeans look really ?dirty? when youpull them out of the package. but after a few months of washing, the dirty color has reallymellowed. also, i am a usual 26 in jeans, purchased these in 2other and could have fit into the 24. i may purchase another pair, these jeans are really unique, comfortable, great for the summer with sandals or converse.
other These are fabulous leggings for cold days. i am a teacher who has to do crossing guard duty in the mornings and finally i have something stylish that also keeps me warm! love them and i highly recommend. only con is that they are about 1/other of an inch shorter than i would like.
other I love this top! the neckline is so unusual and so flattering. i am normally either a small or xs, but this fit great in the xs. i was also able to wear a regular bra which is always nice since i am large chested. great top...highly recommend.
other I love this shirt so much i bought it (nearly) full price with my birthday month discount!get it! i purchased the red and also like the black/white polka dots - hangs beautifully,feels heavenly and polished and fun at the same time. i bought the medium am generallya medium.
other This dress is so cute! i went to the store to try it on and although i knew the dress would fit i could not get the zipper up. my mom, the sales lady and i all tried to get the zipper up and it would not move past the ribbon. i wish i could have bought this dress but i can't without a working zipper. i tried a size up and every dress at the store that was my size and none of them worked. please fix the zipper problem so i can have this dress!
other I usually do not buy dresses at full price but when i saw the teal version of this dress on the website i caved in and bought it. i had also tried the pink version of this dress in store. it's very cute and sweet but i don't think i can pull it off. the teal version is pretty accurate in color to the on screen image.this dress runs huge. i usually wear a 6 or 8 in retailer dresses and went with a size other for this one. it fits comfortably without being too baggy or like a tent. the materi
other I couldn't agree more with that first review. i would add that it does run large.the leg holes are big. beautiful flower watercolor design as it shows in the picture. soft fabric and thin elastic waist band. no fake string tightener or buttons. simple and romantic. yet still a good sleep short to prance around the house in:)
other Oh how i have searched for a mid-rise bottom that was not matronly, and finally i have found one! they cover just enough of the back without looking like my mothers bathing suit butt, and the ruched sides add just enough interest to not be boring in a solid color. and speaking of the color, the blue is beautiful. i am happy with these and hope they hold up for several years. i am 12other lbs and the small fit perfect.
other This skirt is a must have!! it is very classy, and the pockets are perfect for holding lipstick for a little refresher throughout the night. it is high quality and definitely worth the price. i paired this skirt with a more casual black top and some pearls for a fancy banquet dinner, and got a lot of compliments. comfortable and classy.
other How can you go wrong with soft cotton top that is neither too snug nor too loose? expect will wear these as layers under when really cold and by them selves in early spring and in the fall. great colors and love the multiple textures.
other I wanted this jacket to fit on me like in the photo, but i guess my frame was still to petite. the fabric was also on the cheap end
other Was really excited for this dress and couldn't be more disappointed. doesn't look anything like the pictures.the fabric feels...cheap. it came wadded up in a ball and is a wrinkled mess. looking beyond that, i tried it on and thought i had put it on incorrectly. unfortunately not. the top half doesn't sit correctly. it's so bizarre that it seems like a flaw in the design. it doesn't sit on your shoulders, but doesn't look right off your shoulders. the neckline is very high. also, front b
other This is a beautiful top.  the detail in the pattern of the fabric is gorgeous and the color goes great with jeans.  love the design of arm holes, they don't show your bra!  the only con is price, but it's a keeper.
other I agree with other reviews, soft, cozy and love the embroidery and beading. it is a bit wrinkly even after i ironed it but overall happy with this blouse.
other Great quality and extremely flattering. bonus that it is on sale. i felt like this dress was a godsend. i am five months pregnant and needed a dress that made me feel comfortable but not frumpy. i think i'll get a lot of mileage out of it, as there's enough stretch to get me through the next few months and then (hopefully!) i can wear it after too. also can be dressed up or down, so appropriate for many occasions. i believe it runs true to size (i sized up, from xs to s, for obvious reasons, but
other This is very cute, but i will have to size up my large to extra large. and normally i wear a medium or large. it is quite tight as a large. it looks a lot cuter on the model. so i am hoping the extra large does it.
other I usually wear a size 28 & the fit was perfect. highly recommend, many compliments.
other This top runs extremely large and has a very unflattering cut for those without a straight figure. i have 36ddd boobs and a muscular, curvy frame. this top adds about 20lbs.
other I was so excited to purchase this dress; i love all shades of grey for winter clothing, i love knits, and i have loved other maeve dresses. however, i simply cannot fathom how poorly this is designed--it fits absolutely nothing like it appears to on the model, to the point that i wonder if i might have received a defective dress.for reference, i am 5'5", slender and small-boned but also curvy (hourglass). my bust is 36 c, hips about 37-38. i normally wear a small in maeve dresses. maybe it's j
other This dress comes with a built in fupa. literally there is extra material at the lower abdomen that sticks out and is very unflattering.
other I'll start by saying, over the years, i get more and more frustrated by the lowered quality of retailer's products. this dress represents all of my frustration. cheap, cheap cheap material. low thread count. elastic!!! around the end of the sleeves that rubs the cheap fabric against your arm. i mean, this dress is a total disaster - and looks nothing like the photograph shown.
3 Love at first sight (via the internet); upon arrival, i was on the fence..the fabric is slinky and loose; so much so that i should have ordered a medium instead of a large(perhaps then the dress would have then been more of an a-line fit vs. an over sized dress with no body).the lower section of the sleeves is attached intricately to the upper arms;every slight movement of the body is followed by a slight tug at the sleeve/arm cloth;otherwise, when the arms are extended, the sleeves do hav
other This is a lovely pencil skirt that is well-made and really brightens a work day. like a lot skirts with multiple colors, a lot of tops feel like they should match but you have to try a few that really work with the skirt and your look to get the right impact.
other I am always looking for a nice denim skirt and this one is great the pale pink is perfect and the stretch is awesome. i wore wedges with it and a nice romantic top and it looked great. i originally got a 8 and a 10 and kept the 8 because of the stretch it fit perfectly. nice length and great quality
other Love this jacket! the sleeves are a little big/loose but it's not quite as flattering as it could be, but it's so comfy it's worth it! great quality.
other This top is so soft and comfortable. i bought it on sale, so would i have paid $60 for it . . . . not sure. fits true to size, what can i say its a simple top, well made and so soft.
other This dress is fantastic. super flattering and unique. i get a compliment every time i wear it. i encourage retailer to source more dresses from this brand/designer. lovely. i am picky and nevery give a perfect rating, this dress got all other stars.
other I was drawn to this blouse because it was silk and looked so well made. the color palette is an added bonus. i knew for my height to size up because it looked short. i tried on the 1other & felt it was still to short. i would have to wear a 1other or 16 to get the length i would like. i think overall this would be a great buy for a person with a smaller bust or shorter. i am 5'8 1/other & a 36d.
other I ordered this dress to wear to a summer wedding in san francisco. i liked that it had sleeves, a plus. when i was trying it on, i found that it was a little snug, then realized it was the slip, which is not too tight at all once the dress is on. it helps to smooth those little bumps. it is drop waist style, which skims the torso, then flares out prettily. all in all very complimentary, beautiful color, well made. very pleased; it will be comfortable and perfect at the wedding.
other I really like this romper and i ordered it to fit my bottom. i'm a 6 on the bottom and other up top. i ordered a mp to cover the bottom and a petite for my height. it's a keeper but i will be belting or adding something to cinch it at the waist so that it has more of a shape.
other New fav lbd. i am other months postpartum and this dress makes me feel like my old self again. it fits right above the waist, with a bow to cinch the waist. love the fit and flare. the top is warm, great for a cold evening out. and the taffeta really dresses it up. love
other I love the coziness of this sweater. i do think it is designed for a looser fit, but i sized down for a closer fit. the sleeve design is unique and flattering i think, kind of of like a cap sleeve would be if you were wearing a long sleeve shirt under it. i gave it other stars instead of other because it does shed some, but has so many other positive features that i am keeping it and plan to wear it with lighter colors so i don't need to worry about it.just lovely really, love the blue color especially
other I recently purchased the reading room cardigan in the color pink. the color is beautiful, and very flattering with my olive complexion. i ordered a medium, and although it's not a traditional fitted cardigan, the shape was very flattering, good length for my 5' 6" height, and is very versatile. great for transitional weather into spring.
other The colors on this top are very bright & cheery. i love wearing this top. i get a lot of complements on the combination of the pastel colors. it reminds me of a warm summer day. i wear a pink tank under neath and it really brings out the pink colors of the top.
other Really fun comfortable pants. i haven't worn them yet as its hot here but i can't wait. i tried them on with wedge sandals & a lacey bohemian top and they looked awesome. i also tried them on with white rocker booties and my vintage t that says "italians do it better" and a jean jacket...i'm loving the look & feel of them, bring on the cool autumn days.
other I love this dress. so simple yet beautiful. very excited to wear this spring and summer, perfect for easter.
other I absolutely love this dress. it's great quality and fits perfectly.
3 Loved the print/pattern and the light grey.....i think it might have been better if reversed (it has a v in the back, and the front neckline was very intrusive and scratchy to me). i'm normally a small but got this in a medium and it was very short on me. wish it could have worked but returning it.
other Love this skirt. very comfy. looks like it's very expensive material but feels comfortable.
other Unique vest: modern, chic. i especially like the color block one the collar part. i know it will become a staple in my working clothes, and i can also see it blend in to my weekend clothes. i don't think the back of this vest is of bad quality, like another reviewer said. overall it's a hight-quality piece.
other It is the perfect shirt that looks and feels great. i wear a size other and it fits perfectly.
3 This top is oversized. i normally wear large but thought an xl would be best for sleeping. it's huge. so stick with your normal size or a size down. pretty print. fabric is a bit coarse. undecided about trying a size down because i'm particular and they didn't wow me. also ordered these in the lighter color and they fit the same.
other I ordered this after reading the stellar reviews and i was not disappointed! i ordered the black and purple floral motif and both are excellent. i have a rather big chest (36dd) and the shelf bra and halter support are just enough for me. look forward to wearing this on my upcoming vacation!
other If you are over 25, this top probably is not for you. it is absolutely see-thru. great style and beautiful light fabric, but you can see right thru it.
other I love this sweatshirt! new favorite! it has a comfy meant to be oversized fit... love the little inspirational quote... and it's the kind of sweatshirt you want to live in! so stinking soft! got lots of compliments at the gym and the pick up line at school!!!
3 Well made. made my hips looks giant. just not my style unfortunately. i'd have to work at preschool or on a ship to pull this off. i'm 5'3 120-123lbssize 6-8. i got the size 6 (not petite cuz they were sold out).
other I loved this top... the color is true to screen. the cut is cute. it's a lovely basic top that has just the right twist to it. i loved the fabric. it is see-through but if you wear a nude colored bra under it nothing shows.
other This is a very comfortable, good-looking skirt. fits as shown. the zipper however is rather short, and it takes a bit of squirming to get it over the hips. once on, it's great.  it is not made in the usa, as stated. it is clearly marked "made in mexico" from "globally sourced" materials (i.e. not from the us).
other I didn't have a problem anticipating the fit of this dress. i felt with the drawstrings on each side i could make it work. i usually take a large and even ordered a medium as i had read all the reviews of it running big. when i got the dress, i was beyond disappointed. it is a heavy, itchy polyester-like fabric, not a thin rayon looking texture like the picture shows. it is also a deep black, not the plum color in 4/other photos. but most importantly, i am 5'8" and the dress is very short on me. it'
other This is such a great top that when my cat snagged it i bought a second version to wear in public and kept the snagged version to wear around the house or for working out. it is super comfortable and can be worn with so many things. definitely on the more casual side but you can dress it up slightly w/ jeans and booties, or it can be worn w/ leggings, jeans and tennis shoes, etc. i also bought the coral color in addition to the blue. if you're on the fence i would say you can't go wrong with buyi
other When i tried this top on, i started laughing. the two rows of ruffles are made of a starchy thick cotton, which, instead of falling by the hips, juts out like wings. it's also huge. cute idea, wrong material and placement.
other I ordered these in both the grey and moss, and i love both. they are very soft, very easy, loose fitting casual shorts. i wear them a bit lower on my waist than pictured, so they hit lower on my leg than on the model, which i prefer in these. i am 5'3, 10other lbs, ordered xs. the dark grey ones feel more versatile, like you could throw on anything with them and go. the moss look cute with white/cream summery tops. they washed well (machine, cold, laid flat to dry), touched up with light steam from
3 I ordered this item when it was first advertised, fell in love with the unique pattern in the top and could hardly wait for it to get here. however when i received the top i was very disappointed, the fabric is cheap, the sleeves are tight and the overall product is of poor quality and poorly constructed. needless to say i returned it.
other The first reviewer summed up many of my thoughts exactly. i don't like to go without a bra and this dress with its slightly wider, almost cap-sleeve straps solves my problem perfectly. i love this neckline and wish i'd see it in more maxi dresses! the crossover and cutouts in the back mimic the lines of a traditional indian sari blouse and skirt, again without sacrificing bra coverage. just a beautiful and inspired design - definitely a standout in the sea of summer maxi dresses i've seen. i lov
other I was disappointed with the style and quality of this dress. it poofs out funny in the waste and it just looks very unflattering. i'm sending it back.
other I tried it on and it fit like a glove. it was a little strange having a different fabric on the back, but it worked and i am keeping it.
other Bought this in cream in my usual xs/0, (5'7", 32b, 115lbs). it is a very flattering summer weight cardi which will work well with jeans and maxi dresses this summer. i would point out however that the sleeves are very snug - if you don't have thin arms then you may have to consider sizing up. i stuck with the xs even though i had to carefully pull the arms on because the s was just a little looser in the back. the sleeves are meant to be form fitting but i think they have been designed a little
other I agree with the others...this is the type sweater that hooked me on retailer ten years ago. i love my new sweater. i do recommend wearing a long sleeve tee underneath. the sleeves are itchy.
other Love the way this looked online/on model. would not recommend for a shorter or curvy person such as myself. it just ended up looking like a very chic potato sack on me, and was not flattering.
3 I wanted to love this so much! i am 5'8 and normally do a size large in retailer, but based on the previous review i sized down. the top fit fine, but the bottom just sort of poofed out. not flattering. it does have pockets which are amazing, but overall, just wasn't a good fit. the top is t-shirt material, not denim.
other I bought this dress to wear to a fall wedding and couldn't be happier! i'm very curvy (34dd-28-43) and the medium fit like a glove. the fabric has a great 70's vibe while the fit is extremely classic. i have never felt more beautiful and received many compliments. i am 5'6" and it hit just to the top of my feet. i highly recommend.
other Looks like a pregnancy top. a lot gathers in front and back. added 10 pounds to me. not flattering on, much longer than on the model. and the color is not white. it's white with a weird tan/ taupe stripe.i returned it same day i received it, which was disappointing.
other I just saw this in the store and loved it! it is shorter than pictured on the model, but it's not short. with a long shirt underneath, i'll wear it with leggings. the color is beautiful!! the size does run large - i normally wear a large at retailer, and i got this in a medium. i can't wait to wear it all fall and winter long!
other I need to remember that this brand runs small. i ordered the xxsp and i usually have a little room with jacket, but this fits snug. i have one from last year and it's the same. fits snug. if you want extra room, order a size up. the quality is nice, i love the camel brown color. it's a keeper for me, just won't be able to wear a sweater under it.
other Sweater dresses are my fall/winter uniform and the patterns on this one are particularly unique and lovely. i'm 5'2'' with a small bust, this fit nicely and moves well, it's not baggy or bulky and not tight. good for work and play. i would usually wait to see if an item at this price goes on sale, but this one is the kind of piece that i expect to be snapped up swiftly and i don't regret getting it at full price.
other These pants were a wonderful addition to my wardrobe! the fun print and texture add interest, but at the same time, are not too busy. they seem well-made, and they have a slim and flattering fit. the side zipper is also a nice touch. i would definitely recommend this item.
other I loved the photo of this dress. upon examination of the dress (and trying it on) after receiving in the mail, the dress shown online is nothing like the dress i received save for the pattern. the dress i received has a side zip as well as a belt and no pleats on the top. the bottom is also cut straight across not as it appears in the photo. turns out it is not as flattering as it should appear.
other True to the verdugo style. love the fit, stretch but holds shape...super comfy!
other I really like this piece; the fit is great, the double zipper falters and cinched waist and 3/other sleeves flatter. i will say, it's pricey for what it is (a cardigan) - but it's a great, versatile closet staple.
other I love this sweatshirt! i truly did not pay much attention to it on line but while in my local store one was returned and it caught my eye immediately as the flowers are embroidered in a nice substantial rope type yarn to give it a more demential effect. the torn holes here and there give the appearance of being the most loved garment in your closet...and it has become mine along with the jacket with the same embroidery...funny how other pieces i did not give a second thought about have become my li
other I saw this online and loved it, then when it was on sale i went into the store and tried it on and i couldn't resist. the only size that was left in stores was an xs petit and i didn't think that it would fit me because i am usually a regular s/m but it was super comfortable and very stylish. it wasn't too big or too small, it fit me just right without any awkwardness.
other Ditto on the oversized comments. am generally a large in tees and sized down to a petite large and probably could fit nicely in a petite medium. the stitching on the neck and front design are adorable. a bit long but great potential for layering to showcase the writing on the collar or cute design on the front.  think it's a keeper!
3 I found this dress to be beautiful. only down side? you'd need to size up two sizes if you have any breasts or butt. i'm usually size s/m in maeve. i bought this in l and looked like a stuffed sausage. i'm 5'1", 140lbs, 36d, 39" hips. i'd need an xl.
other I ordered the blouse in black. it's not quite black but maybe in between a brownish gray. very pretty color. it fits just right. would have like it just a tad longer.
other Great fitting longer tee. comfortable and light. longer short sleeve a nice change from cap sleeves.
other I sat on the fence almost too long on this piece and finally ordered one when it popped up as a return...so happy imwas able to snag it. it is incredible. i put it with my favorite closed jeans and chanel work boots and wow! i also have tried belting it where the fur begins and that looks equally fabulous. imput true to size as it is suppose to be roomy, to many people ruin styles by trying to get them to fit in a way they were not meant to...embrace the uniqueness of this piece and roder true t
other Best part: covers my bum. perfect for teaching, casual girls' night or casual date night.  my only complaint is there aren't other colors. awful decision. i would have purchased at least other of these at the right price.
other Possibly my favorite retailer purchase ever! like wearing a cloud & fit perfectly! if you're busty - not sure about it -- but otherwise wow! told my husband: hope you like it because you'll be seeing it all the time & he not only agreed but wanted to know if they made pajamas for men.
other I purchased this dress in the navy and white stripe. i did purchase the petite since i'm 5'2" and it worked out great. very nice style, comfy and flattering. looks great with a pair of boots. one of my go to dresses for sure.
other I love the design of this cape. most capes are coats which can only be wore in the fall months here in the midwest since winter is too cold. this cape is more like a layering piece for indoors similar to a cardigan sweater, which i like. it can be wore in an office setting or out on the town with jeans. the constructions is well made as well
other Unfortunately, this dress is shaped like a sack and has no shape to speak of. i have sent it back for a refund :( too big, too shapeless.
other Ordered this vest on line and returned it due too poor quality .
other Great fabric, details, construction...but, it is not grey!! definitely shades of brown!! i do like the look & style of this top.
other I'm always on the lookout for pieces that look polished, but aren't fussy. this is *that* blazer. i'm rather petite and bought the xs, though wish they had the petite in store to try on as xs is not very fitted on my frame. the perfect weight for 6other degree summer days.
other Everyone else who reviewed felt the dress fit quite odd.  i have an oddly shaped body, so this dress was perfect on me!  the bigger bodice fit on my large broad rounded upper body, skimmed my true waist and flared out to complimentary skirt that wasn't too twee.  the silhouette evens out my odd figure.  the fabric is a gorgeous pink/orange/teal pattern on comfortable cotton.  i do have to agree with the lowness of the neckline, it's a bit immodest.  i wear my cropped denim jacket and a simple la
other I loved the cut out features on the shoulders of this shirt. it has the palest tone as pictured and will be cute with jeans this summer and on vacation. i took one star away because the body is cut rather large. i tested the center back fit and that was fine. i wish the body was a little more narrow.
other I think this is adorable and am so excited to have bought it. it is really flattering. i love how it hangs-- it's loose enough without being unflattering at all. it's a little retro. it feels really soft! i hope it holds up well. i'm 5'other and and 103. i got an xs and it fits perfectly.
other This dress is super super pretty. it is very dull light blue grey, very romantic with the black blow. very very pretty, i love it! my only complaint is that it "balloons" up a bit due to the fabric. it is very fitted for me, i think if it were a tad loose fitting it would not balloon up around the curves as much. it is short and comes a little above the knees. i love this dress for it's romantic look, it can be paired with leggings as well.can't wait to wear it.
other Love this dress. from the great fabric (soft yet substantial) that's similar to sweater material, to the amazing detail of the flower design (it's really so unique and i mean that in a good way!), to the color (a tan with gold flecking), and lastly to the really flattering fit, not to mention those retro bell sleeves!  all around a fun dress! it was true to size and not too short, hitting my 5'4" height about 2" above my knees.
other This is my third dress by this designer. i love his work. this will be the most versatile and classic of the three.i love how wearing his dresses makes me feel... my best and comfortable. unique and well made.
other Great dress, nicely structured, but the fabric is very thick and since it's lined, it's a very "warm" dress. not something you would wear in the spring, especially in the summer. ordered in petite, so hem length was perfect on me (i'm 5').
other Love this top and will be wearing it for our fall family pics this weekend! it is lovely, soft and flattering.
other Love this sweater. one of my favorite fall purchases by far. love how it hangs - especially the low back. it's simple, comfortable yet so chic at the same time. i bought the grey and goes great with skinny jeans and boots.
3 I tried on the grey version in store, and it was significantly longer than pictured. the back came down to just below my knee, which looked awkward with the split sides. i am 5'4" and this was a regular (not petite) size. however, the overall quality of the fabric was good and it seemed durable.
other The color is completely off! i loved the way this vest looks in the picture! i was excited to have that vest but unfortunately what i received in the mail was a huge disappointment. it came wrinkled and the brown is not as rich as it is in the picture. very pale. horrible.
other I love this skirt; but it is so long that i have ordered the petite as well to see which one i will keep. i am tall; but even pulled up higher than my waist, there is at least 3 inches too much in length and i want to wear a flat shoe or boot with it. if i keep this one, it will need to be altered. it has pockets which i love. it is an effortless long skirt which i will wear christmas day for sure. the pattern is stunning with the mixed prints. the fabric is silky. it can be dressed down with a
other This is a beautiful top. it's unique and not so ordinary. i bought my usual medium and i found that it fits tight across my chest. although i had a baby this year and i am nursing, so that could be why. if i bought again i would size up.
3 The fit is gorgeous, but i didn't realize it was completely transparent. when it says "mesh" it means "mesh"! i was thinking the "mesh" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut, high on the shoulders, you can't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute, but not practical.
other This is a beautiful top, but it runs large.i am exchanging for one size smaller.it is worth the effort of exchanging!well made, beautiful lace.
other I wound up returning this shirt, because i ordered the wrong size! so sad. i should have sized down. i'm tall, and long waisted, but slight on top. the shirt is gorgeous, and the detailing is perfectly done. i'd definitely recommend trying this one. just choose your size carefully..
3 It didn't work with my frame at all, but is very nice!
other I tried these on on a whim because i liked the shirt that they were displayed with in the store and was surprised how much i liked them! they are a great lighter weight alternative to the pilcro hyphen chino. great for hot days of summer.the subtle vertical stripes go with everything and help elongate the leg. overall a really flattering cut. the waist is not too low and does not create muffin top.
other I agree with all the positive reviews about the look, fit and comfort of this dress.  definitely a four season dress.  for winter i plan on wearing wool tights, wool coat and boots and keeping the waist untied.  for me both the medium petite & regular looked good just a bit tight in the shoulders, since that's how my body is built.  i'm keeping the regular hem version.  my stats for fit reference: 5'3" 140# 36dd, meaty arms/shoulders/back, small hips, no waist/bum.
other Cute top & well constructed. was surprised at the various gatherings i hadn't noticed before ordering, really like the billowy aspect on the bottom. received lots of compliments.
other I pretty much am in agreement with the first, original reviewer on here. big disappointment, especially if you have hips and are busty._____________pros:- great breathable fabric.- cute look overall.- sash in front brings it all together.- buttons are hidden under a panel of fabric, which is a nice touch.____________cons:- runs very small in the bust. normally, i can wear a 10 or 1other with most of retailer's stuff. i tried on a 1other and it fit everywhere with entirely too much room i
3 I ordered the pink, and it was gorgeous. the color and feel were so soft, i would have kept it if it were a blanket. but i did send it back because as a sweater, it just didn't lay right. it has a sort of inside layer that just didn't fit right with the outside sweater layer, so it ended up puffing up on the sides at the waist. that was not flattering. and the hood was too large and floppy looking. too bad.
other I received many compliments on this top. it's very cute and versatile. a pair of jeans or a skirt or capris all can work well with this.
other Wish they had more colors avail in my size when i bought this one. you can easily dress it up or down.
other Maybe i didn't read the description correctly, but i was surprised that this skirt has two front slits, thigh-level, rather than just one, as shown in the photo above. it's gorgeous silk, the patterns are vivid, and the pleats are classy, giving just the right balance of form and flow. however, when i sat down, very little coverage!! ...which means i wouldn't wear it much. i considered taking it to my tailor, but too much effort and $$. however, it's beautifully crafted if you're looking for som
3 This dress was stunning on the hanger -- on me not so much. i am 5' 1.5" and typically a sz 2. the smallest size at the store was a 4. i felt it was baggy about the waist and the length would have been better in petite sizing. the print is gorgeous with beading accenting different flowers. there is a tinge of green-yellow to the background fabric and the color did not look good on me. i hope to try this in a 4p.
other I ordered this bra in my normal size 32d, and it fits me perfectly. this bra is beautiful. the material seems to be very high quality, and the comfort of this bra is amazing. it's definitely a keeper.
other The longer back makes this one of my favorite pieces for fall. the navy blue pairs well with the floral accents on the back. this blouse is a little too sheer for my liking, but nothing a cami cannot fix.
other I wanted to love this dress..and it did not disappoint! true to size, not too snug but doesn't make you look shapeless. the material is soft and has great movement. looks great with boots and booties. i know i will be wearing this one often!
other I love love love this top and have received many compliments. if anything it runs small (i wear size 6 and a 36d bra and the s was roomy)
other This top is tight across the bust (i am a 32dd cup) and more trapeze-shaped than the picture shows. if you are smaller busted, it may not flare out as much.also- the sz 10 is what was tight - and i usually wear a sz. other or 6, or small-size top/blouse.in the end, this wasn't very flattering as it looked more like a maternity top.
other I tried on about 2other items in the store today and didn't buy anything but if i had bought just one thing it would have been this great floral t-shirt (i may have to go back for it). the combination of the very soft material and faded look of the pattern gives it the look and feel of an old favorite tee shirt. the fit is exceptional as well- not too loose or too snug. i would definitely snap it up on sale and may even have to cave to the full price.
other I laughed to myself  as i pulled these jeans on in the dressing room, expecting them to look ridiculous. instead, i was amazed at how well they fit, how cool they looked, and how comfortable they were (two sizes smaller than my usual).  yes, this 66 yo woman rocked these jeans!  i love the intricate whiskering, raw leg opening, and worn, dirty wash.  usually i do not like the dirty look, but this is good dirty. try them on:  you may just fall for them.
3 Pretty color, great details, awesome stitching.. aaaaannnnnnd it actually not only goes out a line but ballooned out above the hem and then came back in - just too much fabric down below. nice at neck, arms and chest but disastrous anywhere below that.
other I was so pleased to receive this dress after purchasing it online -- the color is vibrant, the lace is beautiful, and it is fully lined! fit is true to size, and its a fit and flare dress so flattering for most body types. i could dress it up or down for lunches or weddings so overall, i think its a great dress for a great price!
3 I wanted this top in a petite xs, but it was sold out so i got the xs. i'm 5'2" with a 34b bust, and while the bottom comes down to my waist like on the model, the sleeves are a bit long...they seem a little long on the model, too. i wore this to work and constantly had to pull my top back as the scoop neck kept drooping down as i moved around throughout the day. really like the tie neck feature though.
other When i wore this the two times i did, i got a ton of compliments. it runs small, and is a bit tight when sized correctly but its really stunning. after the second wear, the fabric under the arms frayed and its now unwearable. i have to return it and am so disappointed. sadly, i would not recommend buying it for that reason.
other I loved the look of these jeans-super cute-however they were way too tight! i ordered my usual size 31. they don't fit like a darker pair of serif jeans i own. back they go ! i'd be curious if anyone else found these to run smaller.
other The only strange thing is the size. i used to wear size s (117bl) but this time the small is way too big. i still keep it and put a belt on. it is a very very pretty dress. i used to buy sale from antheropologie. but can not wait this time. i am very impressed by the design. can not praise more!
other I really love this top; i got the ivory and now i will probably get the black too. if you get it in your normal size (i'm almost always an xs and got this in xs), it's fitted and flattering. the seam across the sternum makes it feel like an empire top which always seems to look good on me. it is fitting in the chest and arms. it's really lightweight and has 1/other sleeves so i will wear this even in summer.
other This is a cute top but i wore it for around other hours and lo and behold i had smurf skin. i did not sweat in it but the color transferred to my underarm area and bra and it did not come off in the shower!! i guess it's going to have to wear off. thank goodness it was not a hot day!! i hope that i can return it.
other This dress is casual enough to throw on as a cover up and dressy enough for a night out. it so comfy and versatile. will never go out of style. it does run large, but that is just the style of the dress. it really is the perfect summer dress.
other I found these jeans on the sale rack at my local retailer. they were the very last pair and in my size. i couldn't believe my luck.  i tried them on and was very impressed with the fit and feel of the jeans. thyre soft yet substantial. they retain thier shape. . love the worn in look to them.  .. .. so adorable.  nice slouchy skinny jean.. i stayed true to size
other The large is perfect for me and is just my style - not too baggy but just shapely enough to where to the office with or without leggings, as the fall approaches. i bought the blue; the color is rich and saturated. the material is soft and all around comfortable, which is my number one factor in buying clothes. love its versatility too, since a jacket and scarf can dress it up. shoes also dress up or dress down the dress. all in all a bargain.
other I am typically a 14-16 and the dress is true to size. (xl) i live that the embroidery runs the full length of the dress. i also like the shimmery side seam detail. the front cut near the shoulders is very flattering on. one minor issue is a gap in the bosom area due to button placement. however, i plan to add a snap t i fix. i often have this issue as i am large in that area. the length is flattering as well and provides great coverage in the rear. lightweight and flows nicely. the color is wond
other This jacket is far more attractive than on the website. i would have passed this up had i not seen it in the store. the embroidered sleeve detail is intricate with raised cream colored stitching surrounded by small brass beads on a rich, olive green background. blue detail sets this off as a unique statement piece that will surely draw compliments. i am 5'1, 110 lbs. and the extra small regular fit fine. i considered a petite but the salesperson thought the longer length would look better so i w
other Cute, easy to wear dress. personally i think it looks better with a belt, or something to accentuate the waist. otherwise it's a lot of fabric in the middle. i didn't think the top was too low as others have mentioned. though, it is possible to wear backwards (with a v neck front) if that bothered you. nice length, long enough for work.
other I bought this recently and it is already a go-to piece in my wardrobe. i love it to dress things up for work. it is extremely comfortable and easy to wear.
other Love the shirt! the green is such a vibrant color and it fits great!
other Lovely, but i am sensitive to some fabrics and i couldn't bear the feel of this lace. wish it had worked, so pretty in the picture!
other Super cute basic top but after washing it once according to tag instructions, it is pilling like a well-worn sweater would.
other I got the grey in my normal size large and it fits as shown. love the cowl neck although it's a bit awkward and oversized. the cowl is a lighter shade of grey and a nice contrast. it felt a bit itchy and is a tad boxy and short. i decided to return.
other Really love this bathing suit. it fits very well, definitely don't need to size up for this one. flattering to my mom-bod and breasts that have seen perkier days. excited to be taking this one to costa rica with me this summer!
other I love this brand, i literally live in their tops.. this one is a bit of a disappointment. it is made out of fabric that feels cheap, reminding me of a tissue tee instead of the normal thicker quality of all their other products. it's very thin, and see through. unless wearing a camisole/slip underneath, you have to have the perfect bra and pants situation going on underneath- no muffin tops or back fat!!i got the black, and am keeping it only because i love the design, need a black top desperat
other These trousers are not lined. there is a wide elastic band that runs along the inside of these slacks that is not tacked down, which is a little cheap and probably to keep the price down but doesn't affect the overall fit. and they do fit nice. when your putting them on the fabric bunches at the crotch but then slims out after you zip them (zips up the back.) the fabric has some spandex in it but the lyocell makes them a great choice for work. they hit my ankle a bit lower than on the model. i'm
other I have had my eye on this dress since the spring (in yellow), but it sold out quickly. i jumped on this dress as soon as i saw it come out in different colors this fall! i purchased the peach color and it is really lovely. i will be wearing this dress for family photos. the lace and the details are so very pretty! i am usually a size 0 or 2, and purchased in size other since there is no stretch to it. it is a beautiful dress and i highly recommend it! wish it came in white!
other This is the most comfortable beautiful dress/cover up. i can't believe the sale price. when i ordered, my reg m was not available so i ordered a small. it fits except the top button (36c). i just called and got a m since there was one available today online. hoping it ships! so impressed with this! i'll wear in summer and spring with a white slip underneath.
other This tunic is very nice. flattering, good design, worn in winter and spring, and fits well. i have a curvy figure, and this fits well. i wish it came in more colors.it does show flaws slightly but fits well and is stretchy.
other This is such a cute summer tank to wear with capris or shorts. it is loose fitting and while i normally prefer the petite sizing at 5'1, i got the 00 since i liked the longer length. i purchased the wine and navy colors and the neckline isn't too deep at all. love it!
other Love this pullover for its versatile style (can be buttoned or unbuttoned) and easy care look. it's casual without looking sloppy. the weave is a bit open work and can easily complement a cami or a thicker top without making me look like a stuffed sausage. the hi-lo hem on the model shots do not look that way irl. the hem is straighter. soft nubbly texture that may snag easily. got this in red and brown but wanted the sold out green too.
other I absolutely love this dress! it's a great summer dress that's flirty and fun. i feel this dress runs pretty true to size except in the bust area. the buttons at the top pull a little bit on me unless i wear a bra that pushes the girls up and together. i'm a 32ddd just so you have an idea. i'm 5'10, about 145-150 lbs and i'm a 4-6. in dresses i'm usually able to get away with a 4. i have a bigger bust and bum but a super, tiny waist. i'm just barely able to get away with wearing a other in this dres
other This top is gorgeous! the print is lovely and the material and cut are well constructed. can't wait to wear!
other I'm a sucker for plaid. i tried another plaid shirtdress from retailer, and it looked like a housecoat on me. this is lovely - a bit fitted, but very relaxed and casual. i'll be able to dress it up for casual days at work. it's got enough lovely details to be stylish. i think the waist looks a bit simple, so a belt helps dress it up. the sleeves finish with a button, so it looks polished, or they can be rolled up. i love it with booties!
3 It is indeed cut to the shape of a trench. however, i think retailer should rename it as it's more like wearing a cardigan. it's soft and pretty which i like. however, i wasn't convinced to buy it since i have a gazillion long black cardigans already made out of the same jersey stretch material.
other Yes, it is big. but it is also amazing. so soft, the colors are great, and the hood, well, the hood makes it. great colors for fall. it's a poncho. it's not supposed to be fitted. i'll be wearing this all fall through winter. love it.
other I saw this dress in store. at first i was not impressed because it was shapeless on but i added a belt and it was so much better. i styled it with my leather wrap around ada belt. looks great with a jean jacket or a leather jacket to make it look more chic.
other This dress is beautiful. swingy and fun, and the floral pattern is just stunning for fall and winter. i am planning on wearing it with black tights and ankle booties. could be dressed up or down- very versitle. fits my tall curvy frame perfectly. love.
other I'm 5'other and 110 lbs.  i ordered this in a xsp and i could barely zip it up.  and when i did i couldn't breathe. i tried again and ordered a sp and it's perfect! now i just need somewhere to wear it.
other I've been looking for a more polished edgy alternative to my jean jacket and this is perfect! it's super soft and comfortable. will look awesome over a dress or with jeans. love it!
other Very comfortable and looks really good on me. that's very important!
other Bought all colors and each one is unique in its beauty. material is thicker than most thin tops today but not too thick for the summer. i wear size 12/1other and the xl fit with room to spare. i bought larger in case of shrinkage.
other Love this cozy sweater for layering. i purchased the green, have the cream saved in my cart, and also love the coral and blue too. 5'5", 135lbs, 34c, ordered size small which was perfect
other I ordered this in gray and in white. these are not your mothers' slips. they are comfy and soft. i have worn the white under a shorter dress on a day when i wanted more coverage but didn't want to go for full on tights or leggings. i liked the effect of the slip being longer than the dress. the gray may even be opaque enough to stand (almost) on it's own. very happy with these.
other This dress is very flattering, comfortable and made me feel pretty!
other I bought this top in the stripe and i'm ordering the black now. it's a nice top to transition from summer to fall (even though the temp. doesn't change much in texas...#. it does run a bit large so size down. held up nicely when washed #hand wash cycle).
other Not for shorties. i'm 5'3 and will need to get them hemmed.
other Love this dress! i'm 5'7", 13other lbs and typically wear either a small or x-small in maeve. since this one has lots of extra fabric, i ordered it in an xs and xxs. they were basically the same everywhere except the xxs had a much shorter weave pattern at the top, so i ended up keeping the xs. it's great dress, lots of room and swings nicely.
3 I didn't end up keeping this dress...it just wasn't right for me. it is very cute and fit well but the fabric was very thin (partially lined which is a plus) and the hem line coming up on the sides made it just too short for me. i ordered the petite xs and liked the length in front and back well but the side slit/vent was just too high for my liking. the tie part hit at the perfect spot for me at only 5'4" (~118#). i guess i just didn't "love" it and would rather save my funds for something i ca
other This is a beautiful sweater.
3 This dress fit perfectly, i think it fit just like it shows on the model i also think the color represents itself nicely in person as well. i do however think that the dress is over priced. for as often as you would wear this dress (given that isn't a basic black and would definitely be remembered by people were you to wear it more than once) i think the price is way too high. a must have on sale or clearance, but probably not a keeper for me full price in this color combination, we will see t
other I loved the multi stripe pattern, buttons, pockets and a-line shape .  i agree it runs small. i sized up from my normal size other to size 6.  it sits at my belly button which i like.  i can tuck in a thin shirt comfortably.  the pockets kind of sag/pooch forward and don't lie straight through the course of the day but not enough to really bother me.  i  straighten the skirt by pulling up.  great buy on sale. i'm 5'2", 115#.
other I love this dress! there are so many different looks you can get just by adjusting the straps or shoulders. the material is lightweight and flows with every turn. i ordered my usual size 10 and it fits perfectly. i did need a little assistance in getting the side zip to go up, but once it was on i didn't want to take it off.
other Cute top. not sure about the tassels at the sleeves. very flattering in the waist area.
other Wearing this to a weeding in july. its so feminine and pretty. runs a little big on top at the arm holes, but having it tailored - love!!!!
other I bought the m/l (5'4",130lb) and love the way it hangs and the length, and the fact that it can be worn over a lightweight top. the color and feel of the fabric are very nice.
other This top caught my eye in store because of the fabric texture and light gray color. i wasn't too sure i'd like the cut on the bottom, but the neckline was so lovely i thought i'd try it out. i went with a small which is my usual (if not extra small) and loved it as soon as i put it on. the shape is very flattering, even with my post baby figure. i definitely think that it's better in person than in the photos online. and the price seems very good for a lovely sweater that's both classic and mode
other Snagged this dress in store today. the only reason i didn't give it other stars is because it is dry clean only although i will probably attempt to home wash. it runs very large. i am usually a medium but currently nursing a baby so need large to fit the chest but i bought this dress in a small. also, it can be elegantly worn backward so the zipper is in front to provide nirsing access. i don't think anyone but you would know you are wearing it backwards. very heavy fabric which makes it drape nicel
other I've been waiting for this dress to come back in stock and when it finally did i got it in the size 2. i'm typically a other or other in dresses and the other fits perfect. for reference i'm 5'6, 34c, 130lb. i think it runs on a larger size because it's a shift dress. i would recommend sizing down. a great white dress to wear to my rehearsal dinner!
other I wanted the blight yellow as photo with navy flower motifs. however it was much more darker as on the tag, mustard. if you like its color you will like it.
other I was really suprised when i received this top. it was a knit (more like a t-shirt material), which i really like. this way you can wear casual as well as dressing it up. it is not see thru at all and it stay off the shoulder. the one thing i dont like is the elastic band at top is too wide. but overall ita s keeper!
3 I had to call so many stores to track this shirt down and in the end it wasn't worth it. i got an xs and it was quite baggy. i never buy petite shirts because i feel like they are too short but in this case i think the shirt would have been perfect in whatever the smallest petite size is. for someone who's bigger i'd definitely check this shirt out.
other Comfortable and soft are two of my favorite words when it comes to clothes. this shirt meets both requirement. it is a great length and can be casual and dressed up. must have for fall and winter.
other It's a beautiful skirt. the color is vivid and the skirt is flattering.
other Mutliple layers of buttery softness. i bought the blue and it's true to size. it is soo soft, i could wear this to sleep. it drapes beautifully. highly recommend it. now i want to buy all the colors!
other I adore this dress. i wanted/needed to add a few velvet pieces to my wardrobe and when i saw this online i decided this had to be one of them. i'm 5'9 and ~128 pounds and ordered the x-small and it fits me perfectly. the color is so rich and the details are delicate, understated, and yet striking. i intend to wear this for a variety of occasions.
other This top looks better on than on the hanger. i've been looking for a feminine plaid top and this is the one! it's a flirty and innocent look in one. i would say size up. it runs a little tight around the upper arm, shoulders area when stretching arms out. i normally wear a size 2-other depending on the top and the 6 felt better.
3 Not a huge fan of this dress, will be returning it.fits too big and not flattering.fabric is thin and shows any lumps and bumps you may have.color is not as pretty in person as in the photo - the photo looks like a nice rust color but the dress is actually a boring brownish olive.
other Cute top. fits short but roomy. will get a lot of use in my wardrobe.
3 I love this dress now that it is on sale; sized down to sm petite, added a simple full slip. endless compliments and inquiries on where to buy it!
other This sweater is really beautiful! i love this brand and this piece is one of their best yet! the fringe is perfect and flowy, a sweater that you can team with jeans and boots and be the best dressed in the room. tts, soft with no itch, really happy i bought it, and because of the color and weight this is an all year sweater which i love, because i know i will not want to pack it away. it fits just like the photo.
other This is a very nice, well made skirt but beware, it runs extremely large in size around the waist. i usually wear a m in most things, and i am going to return this skirt for an xs.
other Not flattering and not the color it appears online. this is really a pink shirt.
other This shirt feels amazing. it also drapes nicely and is very feminine and flattering. great versatile piece.
other I love this t shirt and have not purchased it in all 3 colors. very soft and very flattering!!! i like the longer length as well as the pretty neckline.
other This shirt is versatile for work and fun. my sister has this shirt and thought it was so cute, i ordered it too.
other Great versatile skirt, very flattering
other This fabric is the same as the turtleneck swing dress by maeve. it's lightweight and stretchy. the problem with this particular dress is the pattern in the fabric will be a little different on each dress depending on how the pattern was cut when it was made. i had to try on other different dresses to find one that was cut so the pattern looked and fell in the right spots when wearing the dress. hence other stars. the bodice is lined but the skirt itself is not. it is not see through. i'm 5'4" and 120#.
other These pants are so fun! i use them to sleep in as they are see through. i had to size up as the waist band gave me muffin top. i normally wear a small and ended up getting the large.
other I love this top! i ordered it in a medium, and it's perfect. i'm 47 years old, 5'2", 12other lbs, for reference. the detail on this top is beautiful. can be paired with so many things. love it!!!
other Our store only had one petite dress in my size in stock. i'm 5'4" and so can sometimes pull of petite sizing. no in this case. it was a tunic on me. however the dress fit beautifully everywhere else and the quality was beautiful so i'll probably order my size in regular to give it a try.
other This vest is awesome. it can take any dress/outfit and instantly make it more fancy and formal. the way it drapes is very forgiving and the back bow can be modified and switched out for different colors depending on outfit color. .
other Beautiful print, however as the previous reviewer mentioned it is very sheer, much sheerer than the product shot shows. i was expecting to be able to wear a nude bra under this without a cami, however my nude bra was completely visible.the top also ended at the middle of the zipper of my jeans, so much shorter than the tunic length shown, and the bottom half of the sleeves ballooned out much more noticeably in person (the top half of the sleeves are slim, and the bottom half are looser).over
other I was looking for a coat to wear over dresses. this one is the perfect length and works over all lengths of dresses (and looks awesome with jeans too). my only concern is how it will hold up in the rain - it hasn't happened yet!
other This fell apart after wearing it once. for the price, it should hold up better. it's too delicate.
other This dress is lovely.  it flows nicely and is extremely flattering.  also true to size.  unfortunately i do not care for a lot of glitter/sparkle, which this dress has going down the very front so it is going back.  wish i could pull off the glitter but can't.  i absolutely love this dress otherwise and very much recommend it.
other I was very shocked to receive this dress with a rusty zipper, looks like crusty white rust . see attached pictures. the dress fabric is very nice and i did try it on and it is a very nice fit, lined with a little stretch but my gosh what a cheap poor quality zipper that looks like it was old and exposed to moisture because the metal parts have a white crusty substance! retailer you really need to check your merchandise before sending to your loyal customers. lately the quality has been declining a
other Adore the bright embroidery against the black background!  mine was well done and no loose threads.  although this is all synthetic fabric (which i hate paying for!) but i couldn't help myself once i tried it on.  it's very roomy and if you're slender, size down unless you prefer the breezy swingy look like i do.  this is a three season dress that will do well with layers and without.  i picked regular hem instead of petite and it actually looks slimmer on me than the shorter version.
3 I have several pairs of coh and love them all. when i saw these go on sale in my size i quickly purchased them. however, when i tried them on at home and looked in the mirror, i was pretty shocked that the back pockets were extremely long. meaning, they go well below your butt cheeks (like 3"# which means they look like they are sitting too low on your body-and they aren't they are actually i little higher waisted than most coh! i thought perhaps it was my perception that day, so i waited an
other This fit great. i am 5'8 and 130 lbs. i ordered a size medium and it fit perfect. i wore a black tank/cami underneath for warmth in the office.
other So pretty and flattering. it's my new favorite blouse. it's also really comfortable. i do not tuck this one in. i love the knit material makes it extra comfy and breathable. the colors are very pretty and wearable. the quality and cratsmanship are impressive. it has a straight bottom hem and slight boxy cut which i like. i am 5'3" and weight 126 lbs. i ordered the small , but i was going go a slightly bigger comfy fit. i couldn't be happier with this purchase.
other This top is very easy to wear. it's a great, versatile, and unique piece. the textile is really soft and i found, quite special. it is pretty lightweight and the sleeves have some great stripes of more sheer fabric.
other I have a holding horses dress similar to this one from about a year ago.  i loved the swinging fit without it looking like a maternity dress.   the fit and style of this dress is wonderful, it's the color that killed it for me.   i ordered the "orange" because i liked the photo on the model.  when the dress arrived in the mail, i could hardly take it out of the package and try it on.   the color is almost neon orange.   too much for this redhead.  hard to wear that bright neony color.  not sure
3 This shirt is really pretty but the sleeves are so small. i normally wear between a other to a 6 or a size medium and i could not get this shirt on. i wish it fit but a size large would have been way to long and loose.
other This cardigan was a keeper for me. i love the pin that pulls the two sides together or worn open is just a nice decoration. four starts only because i felt like the arms ran a little short.
other Stunning, beautiful, elegant, comfortable and all silk!  the print is very mesmerizing, as are all the hemant & nandita pieces i own.  i'm shocked that there aren't more reviews.  i found this fit perfectly on my body, skimming over my flaws and keeping my temperature moderate.  i am 5'3" 140# 39-28-3other and purchased size mp.  please retailer, offer the other versions of this dress as shown on the uk retailer site.
other I always coveted a pair of flower camos that my sister used to wear. they were perfect, fitted, but not too, casual but not too. i saw these and thought to myself that i finally found them, that i didn't have to covet my sister's pants any more. these check all the boxes--comfy, stylish, high quality, but by the end of the day, they bag out. when i wore them, i had to keep pulling them up--a belt would certainly help. so, i love the pants, but am a bit disappointed with how they lose their shape
other It's so hard to tell exactly what this sweatshirt looks like from the online photos. it has a white and pale sky blue tie dye look all over with a sea foam green floral print. runs tts. the floral print isn't centered on the one i received, but for $1other i'll be keeping it.
other I'm so glad i saw this pretty dress on sale as my eye overlooked when it was introduced. i have to agree with the previous reviewer that the zipper on this adorable dress is yucky to grab and zip. i also wish there were pockets but it's not a deal breaker. perfect dress for autumn/winter especially with a thin layer to wear underneath as the armholes are cut a bit large, showing my side boob and bra. i had to go two sizes up because 10p was sold out. skirt profile looks a little too wide, so i'l
other This romper was cute and short but not too short. the fabric is soft and elegant.
other I wear a lot of solid dark colors for work so i liked this was dark blue but had more pop than the basic navy. able to pay it up with other colors too. the sides are a little shorter so have to watch throughout the day so belly isn't showing. not a bid deal overall.
3 Loved almost everything about this top. the colors are great, comfortable fit, but the length was a little too long for my 5'other frame. i also wasn't a big fan of the large side slit. i would still recommend this great top.
3 Absolutely love the print and quality is great too! unfortunately, for a well endowed woman like myself, it runs terribly small in the bust and hip region. it absolutely does not look as flowy on an hourglass body type. too bad because it's beautiful! might try sizing up but doubt it will work :(
other Beautiful top for summer. love the yellow under the thin white fabric. the photo is good representation. running big.
other Adorable, comfortable piece. runs slightly big.
other This arrived in white at my store and it was so airy and dreamy i had to try it on. this is the epitome of the effortless tank. its a simple throw on with enough style that all it needs is your favorite pair of jeans and a cute necklace. unfortunately it didn't quite work for me. if you have any kind of tummy or chest, size up. i tried on my typical large but it was too tight and ended up looking like a maternity shirt on me. however, my coworker who is much more of a slimmer shape tried this on
other This is a very pretty, delicate, comfortable dress. i think it fits tts - maybe even a little large. i got the ps which is my usual size and it fit perfectly.the only complaint i have is that the photo is misleading. on the dress i received there was nothing to hook the buttons into (no loops as in the photo) so the whole front of the dress has to be unbuttoned. i wish i was able to button other or other as in the photo.
3 My title perfectly describes my attitude toward this sweater. the print is super cute and the price point is great, but this sweater was so itchy that i couldn't even keep it on for longer than a minute. it may be okay with a long sleeve underneath, but don't even think about wearing it by itself!
other I love pilcro script jeans. the rise is super comfortable and the fabric stretch is perfectly flattering without being too tight. the wash is great. from the pictures, i didn't realize this pair had the fringed bottom rather than the hem, but they cuff easily if you want to hide it. plus, with boot season approaching, i think it will make boots more comfortable without the bulky hem. i wish they would make this cut with all of their products - would love to see a pair of cords or dress pants!
other This sweater looks alot better in person. the picture online doesn't do it justice. this can be used both as a sweater or even like a lightweight jacket. a very versatile piece added to the wardrobe. definitely worth the markdown price!only con, is that it has some fluffy pieces in the yarn that comes loose on wearing and sticks to other fabric. so wearing it with black pants might cause a problem.
other The fabric is so soft and completely lined; the straps are adjustable.this is the best summer dress ever!!! so comfortable and easy to just throw on. goes with a multitude of colors for your sandals and bags. i love this dress!i'm 5' 7", 137 lbs., and ordered a size medium, with plenty of room around the bust; no worry about arm holes being too big because you adjust the straps to suit your body. i love the below the knee length. i like comfy but you could easily size down.nice embroidery
other Poor quality. i expected much more from the material.
other Wow! this sure is close fitting, as in suction cups to your body! yikes, definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves. to me, it seems like the material will wear well. i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it, not sure. it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even other lbs, it won't work. i ordered the medium and am usually a small. the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy. i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas.
other I tried this on today because when i touched it, it was irresistibly soft. i like the orange, it was a loud orange-and i almost would have preferred some sort of design to it. i did not purchase this because at the end of the day it did not suit my style-it was very plain. i think you could dress it up with the addition of a belt or the right necklace, but i am not usually a fan of buying pieces that do not stand on their own and require an accessory. that said, it was very comfortable and soft
other I got this because it was on sale and it looked like a fun design.  i like it so much more than i expected to!  the material drapes beautifully so the lower parts skims my body while the upper part moves nicely but doesn&amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;t stick out too much.  i love the green color too!  i tie the ties on the back of the dress--at the level of my shoulder blades--rather than on top as in the photo.  i think it looks cuter that way.  so glad i took a chance on it!
other I have this shirt in more than one color! i totally disagree with the first review i find this shirt to be super comfy and unique! i personally feel the material isn't scratchy at all! also, i love this designer they are one of my new favorites!
other Love this skirt, easy to wear and very flattering. looks better in person, i saw it at the store and bought it; when i looked at it on-line i didn't realize it was the same skirt. this is a "go to" skirt, comfy and sexy all in one! even wore it to the airport with a pair of boots and sweater....super comfortable and still looked nice! great purchase!
other Love the colors in this autumn designed sweater that i just received but it has to be returned. i disagree with one of the reviews that it is not as pictured as far as the green being "off." i think it is just as pictured. i love the texture of the large pockets and belt with the suede feel. i love the flap on the back. what i don't like is how large it is. i have never worn an xs from retailer and i should have listened to the advice from the previous reviews but i didn't. i could send it back
other This is a great sweater. great color and style. i love that it's a little retro. can be worn with jeans and tights. highly recommend. it does run a little big, but not by a lot.
3 This shirt is comfortable and looks just like the picture. my only complaint is that it is quite boxy so not very flattering. the colors and details are great. the material is good quality and thick. if you are looking for a light t-shirt this is not for you
3 I can't figure out if this skirt is supposed to be high-waisted (if so, it's too big but the length works), or if it's supposed to sit on my hips (fits well but too long). but the material is really comfortable, and the design is different in a good way.
other I was hesitant to purchase this because of the price, but the design really spoke to me. i've been waiting for an off the shoulder piece that i love, and this was it. great, light fabric and beautiful design. i love it. worth every penny. can be worn on or off the shoulder like pictured.
other This well made chemise is figure flattering and just the right length for me (5'2"). i would wear it as a slip or a nightie. looking forward to wearing it!
other I fell in love with this dress two years after it sold out so i'm so lucky to have gotten my greedy little hands on this eye catching retro modern number. my mom adores the fit on me as it reminds her of her youth in the 50's and 60's. i originally sized down to a 6, not realizing my bust/wide rib cage would make the fit difficult. wish i could have found an 8 but settled for 10p and will have a tailor finish it. i'm also going to remove the tulle layer since i want to wear as more casual frock.
other I tried these on in a 6 which is my usual size in bottoms that are not designer jeans and they fit ok. they were a little short waisted but i have a long torso. sizing up to an 8 helped but then they were fairly wide in the legs. they are meant to flare out a bit i believe but it was too much for me. i like them but i don't love.
other This dress was not what i had hoped! from the online pictures, i had high hopes, but the fit was really wonky and the material seemed cheap. the arm holes were too big and made the dress seem more like a bathing suit cover up than a classy summer dress. needless to say, it's going back!
3 I agree with the other reviewer that the color of this top is more burgundy with purple undertones rather than a deep red like shown online. the fit was very boxy on me and it did not look flattering. i was not willing to to have it altered so i returned it.
other This is a must have for summer. i'm always hot but sometimes a sweater just doesn't look right. the short sleeves are just what i've been looking for. every jacket i own runs smaller on me around the bust and arms, so i think for everyone else, your normal jacket size should be perfect.
other This sweater is so lovely, i bought it first in navy and then came back for it in grey. very soft and comfortable. the back doesn't wrinkle the way you might think it would from the pics alone. very flattering. i highly recommend it!
other As others mentioned, you have to unbutton all tiny buttons to put on and off... i do hope this gets easier with use... but - gorgeous and flattering as all get out! :-) i love the design in the back, and the little annoying buttons are sooo cute. the cut is super flattering, and classy. i can wear this to work, or out, just don't drink too much water ladies.... i am 11other lbs and 30dd chest, and the 0 petite was perfect. seriously, beautiful... so torn (keeping it for now!)
3 Like the previous reviewer, the biggest problem with this shirt is how short it is. i'm 5'other and ordered a 12, which is usually what i wear at retailer. even only being 5'4, this shirt is much shorter than i anticipated. it fits everywhere else, though. i'm obsessed with the back so i'm going to keep it and wear it. i'd say it's worth it at the sale price.
other These are so great! love the fabric weight ( light ) they look great on - the pictures don't do these justice! i tried them on in the store with a black sleeveless crop top (you couldn't see any mid skin) and it looked great together, might have to go back and get the top! they do look great with just a black tank as well though!
other Great cardigan. love the tie on the back of the collar. excited i was able to get the blue on sale. definitely runs big, but the small fits me well!
other This is the softest shirt, super comfy, very baggy but i'd say true to size for the style. it is a bit thin and i'm worried how it will hold up, or would have given the full other stars. i'm not a usual fan of the turtle neck but this is so soft, i love it!
3 This shirt is not what i expected. i ordered the "green" motif, which is not green at all but black. in the product photos the drawings appear to have a white outlining but its brown. the shirt is made of a good quality cotton and fits great. i ordered the medium. which gave me a lot of extra room to where i could have sized down to a small. for reference i am a 36b and usually wear a medium in most retailer tops. i don't plan on keeping this because i was really hoping for a white background to t
other Such a gorgeous top, the detail and fit are amazing. however, after wearing the top for about 8 hours, 7 of the center rinestones fell off. the beads on the sleeves also snagged the embroidery where the sleeve touches the body. but, i love the top so much, i exchanged it for another and hoping i have better luck with quality this time around.
other Echoing others' remarks, this top runs large/wide (wise to size down). the embroidery is beautiful and for the volume of work, this arrived with minimal to no loose threads. however, i was bit disappointed by the mixed cotton textures - most of the top is a knit, tshirt like textures, while the bottom hem (with the horizontal stripe embroidery) is a stiffer, thinner woven cotton that i had thought would be the material for the whole shirt. the mixtures of textures and predominant knit textile ma
other This is an extremely flattering dress. i couldn't resist buying it, even though i didn't come into the store looking for a dressier dress, which i feel this is. once i tried it on, i had to purchase it. its one of those things that i know i won't regret because at some point, an occasion will show up that i'll wear it to. its soft, comfy and flowing and accentuates the body's curves without being too tight or clingy. its a classic!
other This was absolutely adorable on. it does look a bit like a dress but at 5'3 and 118 lbs i am normally a size 4, and needed the other in this. it fit so perfectly i didn't consider the petite. i can go braless as it has a well lined build in supportive bra. i purchased both colors and it can be dressed up or down. only draw back is dry clean only. super cute, and i definitely recommend this. cuter in person and on.
other So soft!! such beautiful fabric!! it flows so gracefully and looks lovely with black leggings as pictured. one of my favorite retailer purchases to date...
other This cardigan is nice and the lace at the back is pretty. just be aware that it's definitely a cropped length, which is good for wearing over a dress that you don't want to cover up too much. size up if you want room to layer. the one i tried on at the store had the top button almost falling off, so i didn't buy it.
other This tunic is a great way to wear the plaid trend right now without it being the traditional collared shirt. it's fun, comfortable and has great style. the first time i wore it i got tons of compliments! i'm 5'8" and the back of the shirt goes to the back of my knees, i usually wear a size 1other and the large fit great!
other My favorite white blouse ever.i was hesitant, but really love it. it makes me think of summer, flowers, paris.... it's so soft and comfortable. yes, the cut is different and took a moment to get used to... but i like that. and it looks better on. imo. i can see this getting worn a lot on hot summer southern days. i've been on a hunt for a great white blouse for a long time. tres chic!
other This skirt is great and you can't beat it for the price. it fits more like a pencil skirt on me, and looks sort of a-line on the model. very nice work appropriate skirt. though the slit comes higher than i expected. my thighs are tattooed so i put on some black tights and it looks great with a blouse and cardigan!
other Comfortable, relaxed fit. i am very top heavy and the generous cut of this dress worked well!
other Love! accurate sizing feminine details my new favorite top
3 If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing, but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.
other I went into the store to try this one on bc of my broad shoulders and muscular build (in arms) as sometimes the open shoulder pieces fit snug. this dress was perfect and so soft!!! fit me like a glove! i have a long torso and am 5'8'' so it's a little short - but throw on some tights and booties and it's perfect! i'm a size 10/1other and got a large :)
other Have not worn them yet, but they are so soft and pretty. seems like a good item to travel with.
other I tried on the blue in store and ordered the red in petite, and they are both too long (which means i will have to hem). i am not sure if i want to spend the extra money on hemming so hanging on to them for now as i love hte cut and color. they fit like a glove otherwise (i do have muscular thighs). the 0p is good for me (11other lbs). can't go wrong for a nice pant, i can see wearing these out or for work...
other I was excited to find this on sale because i just love baily 44, their designs are always simple, beautiful, and comfortable, and this one, just like the other other baily 4other dresses i own is perfect. i am 5'9, 12other pounds, and 34b bra size and got my usual size, xs. unlike my other baily 4other dresses, this one has a more relaxed fit up top and then has a form fitting layer that shows off your curves on the bottom. i personally don't think it's too short, but then again plan to wear tights with this pi
other Beautiful and stylish. looks amazing with my new black suede over the knee boots! i am 4-6 on top and curvy 6-8 on bottom so aline skirt is great (interior slip is tight straight skirt rather than a-line, which dropped one star).
other This a lovely piece. you have to see it close up to appreciate the subtle details. i typically wear xxsp or xsp, so i did not expect this to fit, but decided to try it because i liked the style. as a petite, many poncho styles overwhelm me and look like tents. not this one. the xxs fit nicely - just the right length and width. i am 5'1" and 108 lbs. i think one of the reasons this has not been popular is because it only shows up when searching on ponchos, and not when you search for sweaters. it
other I would never have bought this top from the online photo but happily came across in in my local store. i bought it in the hot pink gingham check and it is so cute and fresh. will work well for hot summer days when i may want to wear rolled up sleeves as it is very lightweight and gauzy. i bought my usual xs/0, (5'7", 32b, 115lbs), and whilst it is looser on me than the model, i would still say that it is tts - maybe a little fuller in the back than i would like, but i will wear mine partially tu
other This is an amazing swimsuit. i had been on the hunt for the perfect one piece. i wanted something a bit on the modest side, but still sexy, and i hoped for a unique print that would make it stand out. the icing on the cake would be a suit that is functional enough to either lay poolside or scuba dive. enter this swimsuit from retailer. i fell in love with the teal dot print as it's unlike anything else i've seen - it's absolutely spectacular in person. i love the vibrant blue and the chic d
other I just bought this dress and love the fit. i'm pear shaped and it's very flattering! it's not clingy because it is lined and it has great drape. it's also seasonless. it will look great with boots and a sweater or kimono.
other The sweater coat would be wonderful for cooler weather this fall. i ordered it in medium because the small sizes were sold out. sometimes a medium is the right size depending on the brand. i was disappointed that the coat was so large; i don't think it will work for me even with layers underneath. it's a great design but i may have to return it.
other I bought this in navy - it is absolutely stunning and looks like a dress on. super flattering and i don't even need to wear a bra with it
3 So i thought this sweater would be snowy white, but it's actually a beige kind of dingy color. i do not mean that it's unattractive, i do like it, just because it is not snowy white like i thought, it makes it more of a casual sweater in my opinion and i was hoping for a dressy sweater. it is very super soft and is as long as it is pictured. it fits like a dolman sweater which i did not expect either. it's a bit fitted around the very bottom and sleeves are billowy at the top.the picture does no
3 I love everything about this sweater except the sizing. i purchased the deep red in xs. the yarn weight is perfect for me (in los angeles), the length is perfect, the sleeves are bell shaped but not at all a problem for me (they're not so big that they get in my way at all, unlike another reviewer),the collar can be folded in a way that it stands upright for a kind of retro look, which i love. the only problem is that the sweater is way too big. i can handle a wide, swingy style, but with the sl
other Nice, easy to wear dress!
other I purchased this for my 20-something daughter. it is so complimentary and cute and stylish!
other This top is beautiful and i'm in love..but.. it'd huuuuggge! i'm always a large in retailer tops. im going to return for a med or maybe even a small ( which is unheard of for me) .... quality is great!!! get it just size down
other This dress is very comfortable. the fabric is really nice and the dress flows when you move. classic and pretty. i ordered a xs and i'm 5'3 135lbs 34b and the fit was great.
other Such a beautiful dress with my favorite print! it does run a size small if you ask me. the size 10 i got fits more like an 8. the corduroy belt really sets the waist off.
other This sweater is super soft and the metallic banding is a really nice detail. the fabric could turn out to be a bit fragile though. if you have a chest, it may feel a bit boxier than you expect but i don't mind it for a comfy, cozy, soft sweater.
3 I am 5' 8", 14other pounds with a 3other ddd bust. i typically purchase a small or a other to 6 in blouses. this blouse was small across the chest and therefore, i purchased a size 8. it is a nice fit. however, the button placement on the blouse does not work well for someone who is chesty. one button is placed slightly above bust line and the other slightly below. this causes a peek-a-boo space between buttons. therefore, i wear a bright white tank top beneath the blouse and wear the blouse unbuttoned to j
other The fabric felt cheap and i didn't find it to be a flattering top. for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40.
other I got the moss and love the color. the style and size in 31p is perfect for my short self. very comfy for work. now, i need more colors...
other This dress is really beautiful and high quality. the pattern, color, and fabric are great. the fit is flattering (i'm hourglass to pear shaped) and the size perfect for me in petite. please keep offering high quality clothes in petite sizes by higher end designers.
3 Beautiful top, i love the peplum. the color is actually cream with blush accents in the lace. i gave it two stars for quality because the hem was uncut and unfinished so it's going back.
other These are really great legging style cords. you can wear them without worrying about covering your bum in my opinion! they are not too bulky at all which you might expect in a corduroy pant. they are a tad loose in the waist area unfortunately but fit me well in the thighs, so i don't think sizing down would work for me. i bought the bronze, and it's a very versatile color! darker than the picture, but still a good color. i feel it will be perfect for fall and spring especially. i'll wear it all
other It is very cute. i think actual one is much better than the picture.
other Thrilled that this not only fits great on me but i got it at a deep sale price!  all the problems that the negative reviewers had did not apply to me at all.  i'm so glad i gave this a try.  my body is large on top with a square waist, a bit of a tummy, no hips or bum and the medium petite skimmed over all my flaws and made me look more proportionate.  not sure why this is called halter though.  i am 5'3" 36dd, wide torso, size 28 jeans, 140#.
other Love love love this dress! have received so many compliments on it. i'm 5'4", 118 and xs fit perfectly. love the cap sleeves and details, super comfortable too. i can see wearing this year-round and dressing it up/down.
other Wanted to love this- i did love the color and thought the style would work for anyone. but i tried it on and immediately took it off with a definite "not keeping this." the side zipper- a complaint by many, really made it uncomfortable. also, the detail under the bust would not lay flat and just looked odd. loved the material and definitely the green print. but i knew i would never wear it. just looked blah.
other Unfortunately, this sweater let me down! i love retailer, especially their sweaters, but this one fell flat. it was tight on the arms, and didn't hang well on my body. it was odd in length and added about 20lb to my frame. i kept it because i wanted to force it to work, alas, i just donated it. hopefully it fits someone else better than me..
other Love the color! very soft. unique look. can't wait to wear it this fall
other I'm 5'0 and 11other pounds and got the small petite. i have broad shoulders and am slim hipped. i no longer have a waistline, thanks to having given birth, but this dress really hid that. it gave me a figure! the ruching is super flattering and the material has enough support (with stretch!) to hide any unsightly rolls.so why did i return it? i did, after all, get many compliments from females while trying it on. they loved the color on my pale olive complexion (i'm filipino with -ahem- blond hair
other This is a great top, not cheap but funky! it would look nice on any figure. the two blacks on my top are more alike than the picture shows. great value for a pretty party top - but it can go anywhere!
3 Ordered these in 31p last year, prob could have worn a 30p, ordered 30p and 31p this year. the past couple of years the pilcro stet jeans in white fit me because they were cut straighter and not as curvy. this year neither size fit. this year the cut changed and it has a curvier fit. it's the waist that doesn't work for me. if you're curvier this is probably a good fit change.
other I purchased this blouse in black. love it. this blouse goes with everything from jeans to work to cocktail. it is perfect! my only wish is that it came in a colors. i would add navy, red, green, white. i'm tempted to purchase another one just so i never have to worry about the one i have wearing out. buy it - you won't be sorry.
other I ordered this in xsp navy with the merlot/burgundy flower and it fits above the knees as pictured. the tunic is medium weigh and has a-line shape with a loose waist and i find it very comfortable. the sleeve are straight cut (not tight) and 3/other quarter in length. i will wear it with leggings and boots/booties this coming fall.. i find this tunic is well-made and disagreed with one review that it is cheaply made. (wrong color?) fyi: 10other lbs. 32c
other I love this jacket. something to get cozy in on cool california winter nights, and still light enough to wear open and walk around without getting too hot. i am 5'3' and have a medium frame but 3other dd on top. i bought a medium because i hate things to be tight around my chest, and this is perfect. my only disappointment is that i wish it had pockets. i got the wine color and it is very beautiful. wonderful, unique and comfortable jacket. i do recommend it.
other I bought this jacket in the grey blue color and i absolutely love it. it is warm an sophisticated and versatile. i am 5'4" and 160 lbs and the medium was good for me.
other I have countless ag jeans but this has become my current favorite. i love cuffed jeans and actually ordered the two washes for this style. the lighter one which is getting rave reviews i actually returned because of too much distressing and stretch. i like this darkly uniform shade, slimming and more office appropriate for casual fridays. you need to size up on your usual ag size, however, to get the perfect fit.
other I am generally a size l, and after reading reviews, sized down. the inner layer was a little snug, but this was not an issue because of the outer layer. great dress!
other This is the cutest poncho style sweater (but the arms aren't attached like a true poncho. it doesn't work for a petite customer, unfortunately, but on average sized it's gorgeous. so pretty.
other This dress stunning for the hourglass figure. the hips may be a little narrow. i bought the 6p and 4p and the 4p fit best. i read some reviews that said the hips were snug. it's true- a little difficult to sit down haha but the dress is so flattering. shoulders are a little loose, and i have pretty broad shoulders and a full chest. i'm 5'4, 32dd, waist 27 and 130 lbs.
other I love this dress - the fabric is super soft, and it falls beautifully! wish it was lined, but it's a keeper. it does run big - i'm always a solid medium, and i had to go down to a small for this one (but who's complaining!). the burgundy color is gorgeous! i'm 5'other 150 lbs, a size 8 (m) almost always.
3 I returned this one. i usually love cecilia prado? s artistic textiles and was very happy with her floraknit dress, but this skirt was a disappointment . it simply looks different from the picture : it?s way more shimmery- metallic in person, (which i could see a lot of customers actually loved), but to me it made it look cheap. also it lacks structure: the a-shape looks drab on this knit fabric.
other Love the pattern & fabric. it does run a little large. i usually take a medium or large but with this dress, i may have even taken a small. it is somewhat drapey, which i like, but that needs to be considered when sizing for it. i'm hoping it shrinks a tad so the dress has a bit more shape. i'd exchange it, but i love the pattern & quirky sleeves so much i want to keep it! got this gem on sale & can't wait to wear it in the spring & summer months next year (or maybe on a warm vacation)...
other The linen fabric is elegantly thin feels and looks lovely
other Shortened it to knee length and it was perfect. material is soft. comfortable to wear. can be paired with wedges or pumps or flats. fits true to size.
other I love this top! i was hesitant about purchasing based on the other reviews but i'm so happy i decided to order this beautiful top! i'm 5'4" 115lbs and the xs fits great. it does run a lititle big but i like slightly over-sized tops with skinny jeans. the xxs probably would have worked as well. i definitely reccomend giving this top a try but size down if you are going for a more fitted look. the lace detail give this staple piece a nice added detail!
other I bought these pants for a planned trip to southeast asia, where i want to look put together but also be very comfortable. the lightweight fabric is perfect for traveling in warm climates where one shouldn't necessarily be wearing shorts in certain public places or when visiting religious sites. these pants can also go to the pool, out on errands and to brunch. i bought the navy and would considering also buying the beige. great find and very reasonable sale price!
other Super comfortable!! i am 3other weeks pregnant and i works great for me now and i think it will be perfect post baby also!
other I love this dress. i don't have many pink things but saw someone in this on instagram and had to have it. it is as comfy as a nightgown. it has pockets! i tried it with brown sandals as well as with a dark jean jacket and taggart grey booties and looks cute both ways. also looks great with a blingy necklace. tts- got my normal med and it's roomy, but not too big.
other I like the weight of this sweater. it breathes a little but the knit isn't too thin. it is a little see-through, so i like to stick to solids underneath it. it's just a cleaner look than seeing pattern peeking through. great rose color.
other The top runs small, it is a very sexy and slimming top. i tried in l, it was too small so i have ordered it in xl. i hope it fits because it is very fitted and i am worried that the bottom will roll to the top with a fabric like this. but it is a very sexy, good looking, and slimming top. i love it!!
3 First of all, the fabric's summery pattern of blossoms, honeybees and butterflies is beautiful and absolutely unique. i love it so much i wish i could afford to keep the dress as an art object. also, with one important exception, the dress is well made. the underslip is the right length and opacity. the dress is not transparent,which is a big plus. there is a slight greenish cast to the background instead of the pure ivory shownin the pictures. this makes the color a bit harder to wear. and
3 I tried these on because the color is really pretty and fun, and who donse't want a pair of comfy/cute pants... but they looked awful on my muscular thighs... i don't think the cut will be falttering on 99% of the population. also, not as comfortable as they looked, the crotch seemed a little "low" on me, though the pants were in the correct size.
other Love this top! it hits at the top of the waist & is very flattering. the fabric is thicker than i thought it would be and had a deep texture. when i first took it out of the package, i thought it would be a "send-back" because it looked kind of square & shapeless. but once on, it took on a whole other look.
other This is my favorite dress purchase so far in 2016. the fabric feel and thickness is wonderful. it flares out a little but not too much. order the size that matches your largest measurement on the size chart for bust and waist, - or if you have broad shoulders, the larger of your typical size range. i'm typically a 00p or a 0p, with a 00p hip measurement, a middle range (00p is 24, 0p is 25) waist measument (24.5) and a 00p bust measurement, but my shoulders are broad and athletic. 0p, the larger
other Great top for everyday wear. runs a little large as i usually for size medium and i bought a small. a tiny bit see through but i think i can get away without wearing a tank underneath.
other This jacket is beautiful in colors and warm enough to wear in the fall or layer it with a sweater in the winter. it is more taylored at the bottom at the legs and would be great with leggings or jeans. i originally ordered a large but found myself swimming in it so happy it was still available in medium so i re-ordered it. definitely order it in a size smaller. sadly it was after the sale had ended but great customer service they issued it for me at the price i originally paid. (ps i'm 8 months
other I waited six weeks for this dress to arrive and was so disappointed. loved the skirt part of it. but the top, which i guess i didn't see in photo was pleated as well, made my bust look huge and it puffed out on sides. would have been a wonderful summer dress, flowing and cool.
other I ordered the green version in size xl. i knew it was cropped and it fits me as shown on the models. so, i think that's true to size. the knit is very soft. but, it's the color that's amazing--such a rich bright emerald green! i love the look of it. it's awkward fitting on my pear-shape. i layer a long tank underneath with this on top. but, the hemline of the sweater cuts at an unflattering place. still, the softness and the beautiful color make it a staple in my closet. when i'm staying at home
other Comfy sweatshirt with fun polka dot details. soft and not baggy. a little on the shorter side so i think i will layer a lace cami underneath and it will look even prettier. i'm 5'7", 140 pounds with an athletic, hourglass shape, 32dd. i bought the "2" which equates to a medium since i wanted it a little looser being a sweatshirt (i'm normally an retailer small but i don't think that would have worked in this case as it would have been too fitted). great comfy weekend piece!
other This dress runs waaaay small. i would have too size up at least other sizes. while it is a beautiful color, it is an extremely stiff dress. returning!
other I loved this top so much that i ended up purchasing it in another color. it works with so many different outfits, both casual and dressy. it is super comfortable and so soft. i would definitely recommend it!
other Goes well with lots of skirts and pants, including the culottes shown. only downside, and not a big one, the sleeves are finished with elastic instead of a fabric band, which looks a little cheap
other This skirt is absolutely beautiful and is a gorgeous vintage red which is more pigmented than i'm used to in my closet, but that's not necessarily a good thing or a bad thing. it runs a little large in the waist. also, the skirt comes up higher on the torso than pictured. mine comes up to slightly above my waistline and ends at about mid thigh. however, i love this skirt and its timeless design assures me it will stay in my wardrobe for years to come.
other I am super-pleased with this cardigan, which is at a terrific sale price. i saw this in the pink color in the state street retailer in chicago, and i loved the feel of the material but wasn't sure about the color for me. when i saw they had a neutral striped version online, i decided to get it. the material is very soft and the beige/neutral color has a gray undertone which is good for my skintone. the front is double-layered and it has a fun seaming detail in the back and an "unfinished" trim whi
other Really like this shirt. easy to throw on with jeans (black if you don't like the denim on denim). flattering without making you look boxy. arms are roomy too, unlike the what the picture shows.
other Comfy cozy!
other I am 26 weeks pregnant and bought this in an xs to wear to my shower this weekend. i am delighted with how it looks on, but it really might be too big for someone who isn't pregnant.
other I was excited to get this romper, but it just didn't work. i'm petite with a large bust and the blousy design of the top portion just hung like a bag on me. returned.
other Love these pants. bought both the navy and the white. they are comfortable and a perfect fit. the xs is just right. i'm normally a 26 in denim and i was fearful these would either be to small in an xs or too big in a small but the smaller size is just right. soft and silky. they fall in a lovely way.
other This sweater looked so promising with the tie waist and pretty lacy edging, but turned out to be a disappointment. it was much shorter than it looks in the photos and barely came to my hips. and the plum color was much darker than i expected, more of a dull brownish-burgundy.
other This is a really nice top, especially for the price. i am 5'6", 34dd, 140 lbs and normally wear a medium in dolan tops. in this top i purchased size small since the gathered front provides ample room for my bust. some reviewers have found this top to be on the "boxy" side. i can see that if you don't size down as i did. i found the medium to have too much fabric and look very baggy whereas the small was perfect. i do wish this top was a tad bit longer and less sheer, though. white tops should be
other Like the other reviewers said, it has a lot of bulky fabric if you wear it as pictured. i tried it on and tied the string around the back so it's an open vest. i love if!
other I absolutely adore this top. the design on the front is super bright and beautifully done, so beware if you do not like bright colored patterns. i normally wear a size medium and bought a large in this shirt because of reading other reviews, i am glad i did so. i have broad shoulders and muscular arms, and i believe a medium would not have fit my arms and shoulders. however, it is a little boxy in the torso area because of the extra material. therefore, i feel a large feels like a medium in the
other I love these pants! so comfortable and the material is so soft.
other I love rompers and this one is really cute. i usually wear size 1other but should have got a 10, it runs big. it seems too long, and i'm 5'9". the prints cute but a little blah. i paid $158 which is too much, since i haven't worn it yet, i should have waited for it to go on sale.
other This top is the very same top meadow rue had a couple of years ago. i have that top and it is identical so my guess is meadow rue and deletta are owned by the same company.
other Made my wedding outfit perfect!
other Very nice but thin materal. very sheer. i paired with the palmarosa wide legs. loved the way it looked. i do think the sale price is a bit high for this shirt, though.
other Love everything about this dress! it's true to size , flows nicely, great quality. it's just amazing.
other I like this raincoat but it runs large. exchanging for a smaller size.
other This dress is gorgeous in the photograph. and very pretty when it arrived, however, it is very dark in color. you would only notice the blue in bright light or perhaps outside in the sun. the fit was small. i could not get the tie around the waist to look right and feel comfortable, so sadly i had to return it. i applaud retailer for the excellent and attractive packaging. that was almost enough to sell the dress. it came in a very nice white box inside a larger box. tissue paper and fol
3 It was just too big in the regular size and too short in petite.  the proportion was off.  i bought a similar sweater last year in a blue color that i wore constantly and was hoping this would be like it. i think if you are very tall you might pull this off. i'm 5,4" and even the extra small regular hung below my booty.
3 Failed to read website description that vest is polyester shearling-lined.that's on me.beware: pockets decorative only.runs a size small due to fact vest is polyester shearling-lined.
3 Very cute and would transition well season to season with different boots/booties.  didn't lay well on chest for me.  returned it.
other I am a 34dd so i purchased the small in green, hoping for a more fitted silhouette. i got what i wanted and it looked great overall. except for the chest. it just sort of mashed my chest down in a very unflattering way. but despite all that i almost kept the coat because it was so soft and warm and beautiful. and sturdy! i could have sized up for a better fit in the chest but then it would have been boxy and we hourglass shaped ladies know how poorly that works out. wish this would have worked b
other I don't normally try on tops like this but i liked the product shot so much that i wanted to repeat the outfit. i grabbed a large because it wasa shorter blouse. it was huge. i sized down to the medium and it was still loose but if i were to purchase, it would be that size. the red against the blue was very pretty but i didn't know if felt like a little kid in a uniform. the back did not lie flat, not sure if it was because of my 36d chest or because of the shirt design. it is well made and i th
other Love these. wearing them today with a longer tunic style denim shirt and cardigan and boots. nice subtle print. i think they run about other size small. i'm normally a size 0/25. the xs was a bit snug and the material stretched so you could see white around the seams where the print pulled. size s fits great without any pulling and waistband comes up far enough. incidentally, i like them so much bought the same leggings in plain black elsewhere and the size s was the best fit in those too. love love
other Got this shirt in the map design - super cute! it looks great with jeans or chinos in different colors. fun and different shirt. fit just as expected.
other I bought this top in my usual xs size in black and it fit just right. it's very flattering and i love the strip of buttons down the back and the tucks at the shoulders. two things that i did not (could not!) notice by looking online is that this top is actually knitwear! it's still very lightweight and it has a fabric strip that runs along the back strip of buttons. the second thing is that it's a bit transparent. i would definitely prefer to wear a camisole underneath if i'm wearing this top to
other I have this top in orange and white. it is a great top to throw on with jeans. don't put it in the dryer, will shrink.
other I should have listened to the previous review on-line before ordering. unfortunately this will go back as the design fit and proportions are simply off. i love uniquely shaped wraps like this, but this one didn't make the cut for me.
3 I ordered this dress in my usual size and unfortunately when it arrived, it was damaged and also a little too big. the fabric had lots of pulls in it like it had been tried on many times.i called customer service and requested a replacement in a smaller size. it fit great and looked beautiful but there was a rip in the sleeve.this is a gorgeous dress and very flattering and well fitting (if you size down), but i had to return both and wear something else to a holiday party.i'd only recomme
other This sweater was just okay. i am happy to pay $100 or more for a sweater but this one was somewhat itchy, and not the quality i expected for that price. i may have kept it if it were at about half the price, but it just was not worth it. retailer prices seem to be going up and up and the quality less and less. i had similar experiences with a couple of shirts that i ordered over the summer. looked great in the photos, but unfortunately in person were not quality garments.
other Love the lines of this tweed look jacket. pockets are a definite plus, as is the soft pleat in the back. this is a good piece to transition from winter to spring. it updates your jeans and soft t-shirt look.
other The dress is beautiful but runs small so unfortunately i have to return it.
other The top is nice, good quality, etc.... but how do you keep the 'off the shoulder' off the shoulder? mine keeps inching up until it's just a boring white top with a strange loose neckline.
other No, but i'm not a small person. i'm 5'8, a size 6 on top, 8 on bottom. i don't love this on the model online, but i saw this on naomi's blog, love taza, and thought it looked amazing. i tried it on in my retailer, and while they only had a m/l, since i'm tall, i figured that'd be fine. oh. no. not fine. it's huge. like, it could almost cover a twin bed. it was a couple inches longer on me than on the model, and doesn't arc down in a drape nearly as well, so just looks, huuuge. i thought i was bein
other Pretty and with pockets! also, nice quality for the price. interesting texture.
other This is my favorite purchase so far! i am in love with this jumpsuit. it it fitted on top and has a flowy dress feel on the bottom. i got this on sale recently and if you can grab it do it! you won't be disappointed.
other Saw this online and had to try it on when i found it in the store. i usually wear an 8 or a 10 depending on how things run, (i'm a 3other dd), so i tried on both sizes. i really could not see much of a difference between the two and was torn as to which size to get. the 10 was just a tad looser so i went with that one, but seriously i could not find or feel much of a difference. it is a very figure flattering top, and a plus that you can machine wash it. simply awesome!
other For those of you that don't care for stretch jeans you would probably like these. they feel like 100% cotton but better. no stretch at all which i'm glad. i'm not a fan of the stretch. to me these are those comfy go-to jeans. i got my usual size 28 which i perfer in these because i can use the pockets with ease. the pockets are lower side pocket which are great! you will likely need to hem them unless you are pretty tall. i hemmed mine and you can't tell it. i'm not sure how much these could be
other I think this top works best for a petite person. i am 5'1" and 106 lbs. the xs is perfect for me. i love it so much, i purchased it in more colors. i machine washed and line dried. it washed beautifully.
other Love this top. tried it on in the store and had to have it. did not find it too sheer and could wear my regular bra with it, as the shoulders fit where the straps are. got tons of compliments on it. would have bought in more colors if offered i loved it that much. the perfect bohemian hippie chic top, if there is such a style!
other This dress is really cute, but it runs quite large. order a size smaller! i got a lot of compliments on it at the party i wore it to. it can be dressed up or can be casual with a pair of sandles.
other I admit i have a soft spot for a most anything from maeve. this dress is no exception. i had overlooked it online due to the white shirt they show with it online. but the material, design tex are great. the colors are very me and i can see this being a great fall, winter and early spring dress. the material is very soft ( i have sensitive skin) and i love the little pop of color that the front piece adds. the only draw back for me is the lack of pockets and it runs big. i got this on sale so siz
other Feminine flow, however slightly large. such soft material. love the little details.
other This is a nice lightweight summer top to wear with a pair of shorts. it is low cut though - lower than i expected so i wear a tank underneath it. the layers are flattering.
other The colour is gorgeous but it's basically a baby doll dress - it looks like the waist is much lower on the model but for my height and large chest it' fell like a baby doll or a maternity dress. not flattering. pockets are a nice touch though.
3 I am a petite size 10 and 5&#39;1&quot;     i love the fabric and style of the dress, but found it to be too much dress for me.  the skirt is very full and with the top i feel it would look better on a thin, taller person.
other I walked into retailer today to buy other dishes for a registry. $$$ later i walked out with this dress (and another, ugh). it is so beautiful in person. it ever-so-slightly flares out and it definitely has that 70s feel. i got it in white and plan on wearing it for my rehearsal dinner with tan platforms and a flower crown. for reference: 5'7/got some hips and thighs/148lbs - and i got a medium. would have gotten the small but it was slightly shorter.
other Love this shirt, it's so comfy for fall/ winter, but has the really cute detail at the top. love the color too!
other Runs really large. i am 5'4", 120lbs, 32c, and had to exchange xs for xxs for width, but then the sleeves were a little tight. decided to keep the xxs in white.
other I tried this on today and loved it. it is so well made and stays down off the shoulders without any struggle. it is lined in the front and the back is billowy and gorgeous. a timeless and well made piece.
other I purchased in store to avoid shipping costs. my local stores don't carry xxs, so they are mailing it to me. i usually wear an xs, but it was roomier than i cared for and made it look a bit sloppy on me. this tee is more distressed looking in person than online, as well. i wish it were more refined because the neckline is very feminine & interesting; i would have liked the ability to dress it up more. also, the solid blue and coral are lighter in color than they appear on my monitor. the blue st
other My size was not available so based on reviews stating the bagginess of a certain area, i sized down and glad i did. i never size down because i do not like tight clothing, especially casual wear. nice muted print and good quality terry material. recommend, but size down if you want a more fitted feel.
other I wore this with a velvet moss-colored skirt (also sold at retailer) that hits above knee and received so many compliments. the neckline and sleeves are gorgeous. i like my sweaters comfy so i ordered a medium and love it. not quite cropped but it does hit a bit higher on the waist. sleeves hit above wrist as well.
other I love this dress. the pattern is fun, the style is relaxed and breezy for spring/summer, and it is well-made. a steal at the sale price! also, it has pockets :) a huge plus for me. since it is a loose-fitting style, i would say it run just a tad big. i bought the s petite and i am 5'4" 115lbs. i could've gone xs petite ...but the s fits well and looks great. the pattern is stunning. a great addition to my summer wardrobe. i thought about pairing it with a fitted white pant, but it hits me right
other These pajama pants are dreamy in all ways! incredibly soft, with a soft and not binding elastic waist. plus, the print is evocative.i am 5'8" and a size 2/4. i bought these in the store. the only size left was one pair of xs. sure enough they fit.the length is perfect. i just ordered a pair for my sister.
other Cute bright colored suit a little more orange than pink i prefer pink but the fit didn't quite work for me  the bottoms were a little too big and the top although was fairly well proportioned just didn't look right altogether  purchase the extra smalls in both  and have since returned  i do love the suits that retailer has been offering would just love to be able to try them on in the store nice quality good colors
other I love how this sweater fits. i was reluctant to get it because i thought it would be boxy, but it's a perfect length, especially for a higher waisted pants or jeans. the fabric is super soft. i only gave it four stars because i thought it was going to be grey, but it's more like a marled black/white, 80s-style color.
other Great light-weight blouse for mild fall days. fabric is thin so not too warm, which is great for southern california fall. great color palate.
other As other reviewers have said, this is the perfect summer maxi dress! i'm tall, just under 6 feet, and while the dress could be just a bit longer it still works for my height. i do wish the skirt was lined, but other than that the dress is excellent. worth buying at full price if you're worried about it selling out!
other Not just another striped tee. perfect drape & lightly fitted at the bottom sides so it skims the body & is super flattering. the subtle shimmer is just right. love the gray! very versatile & irresistible. i'm a size 4/small & this is tts.
other Love this tee! it's stylish and comfy. i ordered the white and it's a thicker fabric, so i don't have to wear a camisole underneath.  i want to order more colors.  it does slightly big.
other These are so soft and cute and i could see myself wearing them a lot. however, my normal 2other was just too baggy and the few times i tried to wear them around the house, they just bagged out and all i did was pull them up every other seconds. i ordered the black, mostly because i wasn't crazy about any of the other colors. if there were any colors left in a 2other that i could see myself wearing, i would re order them in a smaller size and see if they were any better for me. i think if they fit you well a
other Great spin on a basic turtleneck! i like it unbuttoned just as must as buttoned! material is super soft. good length.
other This tee is s bit on the pricey side but well with it. soft fabric, and unique mix beautiful colors (i got the grey, blush, and gold) that will offer a lot of options on terms of what it can be worn with. i love splendid and this tee is why i do!
other I usually wear a small or medium depending on the cut, but this one only worked in a large. with or without a bra, it was not too low and covers all the middle area flaws beautifully. bust size average and i have muscular (not sticks) arms and a fairly wide back. nice and drapey, pretty green color. great sale price.
3 I should have looked more carefully at the description of these before i made the purchase. these jeans, unfortunately are very stretchy which i don't like at all. i was looking for 100% cotton with no lycra-love rigid denim so these are not for me. they have a very nice design and fit tts. they are very long so expect hemming if you are not 5'10 at least! the 29 was perfectly sized and will be flattering on a curvy figure, i would imagine. rear pockets are placed very low on the bottom giving t
other I love the feel of the fabric and design of this dress.  i look forward to changing the look with cowboy boots or fringed booties. i also like the option of wearing it opened over a white tee and jeans. worn loose or belted, it can be different every time you wear it. it does run large so you may want to size down.
other I really love this top. normally i would not go for a lot of narrow stripes like this because i would think it is too busy, but this one is certainly the exception. both colors are fantastic and i think the design is alluring-not busy. i like that it buttons down which offers a lot of flexibility to display necklaces or have completely up to complete change the look. one of the things i absolutely love about this is that it has long sleeves. i think it is rare these days to find something that i
other This is the second dress i buy at retailer this year and this one is spot on!! exactly what i was looking for: feminine, dressy yet can be dressed up or down depending on the circumstance. the fabric in this dress is particularly gorgeous, very comfortable on the skin, very flowy so it doesn't have a "heavy" quality to it and the design is amazing with the navy ribbon on the front. i completely fell in love with this dress! this is a little number to keep for many years.
other Great fabric and nice cut - like other reviewer said, fitted but not too....but it was just too short for my legs. i do wonder if the description is wrong but i didn't keep it long enough to measure and check this.
other I took advantage of the sale this weekend & purchased this super cute vest yesterday which made it a more justifiable purchase. it's so soft, fits tts & i just can't wait for cooler weather so i can start wearing it!
other This dress is more lovely in person than in the picture. the lace details show beautifully against its nude slip. i'm 5'1" 130# and regular size other fits perfectly and hits at my knees. it's a very flattering dressy-casual dress. it's a bit pricey for a cotton dress but worth it at the 20% retailer promo.
other I wasn't sure how the knotted front would look on me, but it lays perfectly. very comfortable, well-designed, flattering top in lovely rich colors. i'm normally a small-medium in retailer tops, but i got the large as it does run small and i don't like things too clingy. so best to try on in store rather than buy online. nice simple statement piece!
other This blouse is perfect for a summer afternoon. it;s very light and the v neck back on it is super cute. the coloring is amazing. it's hard to find anything with those two colors incorporated. looks perfect with jeans or shorts and can be dressed up or dressed down. i am a solid 1other in everything...tops and bottoms and this shirt was no differemt. i like it a little loose so i went with my normal size but i am sure i could have gone down to a 10 as well. don't pass this up. it's a lovely lovely to
other I bought this during the 20% off and i'm glad i did. the sweater does run large, so i would recommend sizing down. i'm 5'4, 13other lbs, with a larger bust (34d) and even the size small is large on me (not large enough to exchange, but i would probably do better with an xs; even with an xs i would still get that oversized look). the color is not exactly as pictured, it is a brighter yellow in person. i was expecting more of a muted, soft, baby yellow, and that's not exactly what this is. some pros a
other Perfect semi-dressy summer top, that could definitely go year round. love the buttons up the back. it's flows but the slight peplum keeps it from looking tent like. love this so much i ordered another in black.
other Ordered on line and thought these are a great quality as i pulled them out of the box. tried them on and found minimal elastic for the waist. within minutes of wearing, the waist fell down past my hips...glad i was at home. looks cute but will not stay up.
other I am wearing a bodysuit and long skirt from bhldn for my wedding, and i bought this skirt to change in to for my reception. it is perfectly elegant, yet simple. i cannot wait to wear it on my big day! it can be dressed up or down so easily! love it!
other This is a cute top and i did not even need my usual petite size thanks to the 3/other length sleeves. i liked the semi-abstract sailboat pattern and the style is comfortable to wear. however, the tie at the neckline didn't appeal to me so ultimately i did not buy it.
other I've been moving toward a simple tee and jean wardrobe, and this is the perfect addition! it's so fun and different and so comfortable. i've been loving retailer's new tee's! it runs a little large but in a cute way.
other I love this dress.   i believe the picture on-line doesn't show the unique pattern and design.   it does have an interesting design.    add a long vest, statement necklace, and boots - you will be quite fashionable.
other I love the feel of this shirt. from a distance it looks like flannel but close up it appears more like muslin. i find the fabric very soft and the colors are fab--more vivid than the photo. the buttons do not go all the way up the shirt. for me the top button is right at the top of my cleavage so i can wear it alone or with a cami or other scoop neck. if you want a more refined flannel look/feel, this is it. i find it tts. if you're in between sizes, i would order down.
other Ordered online, just received this vest, so disappointed! love the garment but it is way too small. i wear a medium in most clothing and size 6 in a dress, but the medium in this vest isn't just snug it is definitely too small, even worn alone, i can't button it. i am now ordering the large and keeping my fingers crossed as i want to wear a tee under it. hoping i won't need to return both the m and the l, thinking of ordering an xl.
3 I wanted to love this dress. the colors are heavenly and it looks light and airy. it isn't, it is very heavy, much too heavy for florida heat. the top layer is a beautiful sand color and while the fabric is nice, the heaviness of the top really weighs the whole dress down. i felt like it added ten pounds to my appearance, easily. back it went, boo hoo. if you are between sizes, i would size down, runs a bit big.
other Bought this dress as good transition piece into our hot fall. don't usually go for the uneven hemline. but got so many compliments, i'm expanding my comfort zone.
other I bought this in the mauve in my usual size small. i think this sweater is intentionally big and slouchy, so i would say it runs true to size. it is very soft and the weave is airy--not going to be warm enough for a below freezing day but i love the style. the neckline is a bit fussy but i think you just have to wear it and let it fall the way it wants to. the sleeves are long enough to cover your hands. the sweater, when pulled all the way down, covers my butt and half my thighs (and i'm 5'9" t
other The jeans are soft and comfortable.  they are the perfect staple in my closet.  more colors please!
other Great tee! i usually wear an xs, but ended up getting this in xxsp. it is very long but the petite worked perfect on my 5'9" frame.
other This is my second pair of pilcro chinos. their pants and shorts are so soft--even those who love to run around pantless might relent. this brand tends to run a bit large so if you like your pants form fitting you may want to size down.
other I have been eyeing these pants for about a month or so; every time i stopped by my local retailer store i would check them out but never actually bought them. well, today i finally went for it and i am so glad i did! the floral pattern is very feminine yet unique and the colors are uplifting and cheerful for spring. the material is very soft, light and flowy and i'm sure will be comfortable in the heat of summer. the only drawback i found was that the fabric is not very stretchy and i like to be a
other This ribbed henley is incredibly soft. you'll love the way it feels, but it does run a little small so i'd recommend getting one size up if you don't want it to be too form fitting.
other This is a really great top. it looks fantastic on. while it is a bigger fit, its so flattering. i get tons of compliments every time i wear it.
other I was excited to see these jeans since they came in petite sizes and had a short inseam... unfortunately after ordering/returning several pairs, i found out that these are actually not petite jeans. please beware that if you are ordering these for the shorter inseam, they are actually 28 in... not 2other in as in the description. other than the inseam issues, they fit like typical paige denim.
other Soft fabric, waistband is flat no vpl!lace trim cuts in a bit for a little vpl- but still nice lightweight, barely there but full coverage. would buy again!
3 These shorts are just beautiful. with that said, they were expensive, but made reasonable when i snagged them in the online sale! they do also run large, and they seem to be made for short-waisted bodies. i will be bringing them back to my local store to (hopefully) exchange for a smaller size. fingers crossed that they still have them in stock!
other The top itself is beautiful and colors are like pictured. my only issue was the size. i went for medium ( i'm usually m or l) and i'm 5'4" so i can get away with regular and pettite. this top was way too long. looked like dress on me. i'm sending it back for exchange
3 The detail on this top is beautiful, love the embroidery ! i wanted it to work so bad, but it is much too wide, bells out and makes my size 8/10 body look wider than it is, another reviewer mentioned the model must have it pinned on the sides, because the top does not lay like that. it runs large, especially under the arms. too bad......
other I tried this on at my local store. i love the look and the color of the blue tank and wanted very much to like it. alas, it was not to be. the material is super thin (almost see-through) and it is of poor quality. i did not buy it.
other Tried it on in store and found it cute and comfortable, it might run a little big since i was expecting to fit into small but found the xs fit and looked better. i will consider when on sale. i felt that it was way over priced.however if money is no issue i would buy it.
other I thought i would love this shirt because it goes along with my style, but i returned it immediately. it runs so large! the colors are faded, and the trim of the shirt curl over, so it looks cheap and frumpy. i do not recommend this! it hits in all the wrong places.
other This is perfect! it fits tts. i am usually an 8 and this was spot on. it isn't too short either. it really is as it appears on the model. i absolutely love it and can't wait to wear it. my hubby definitely approved!
other Beautiful colors and silhouette (i got the navy). the skirt is lined and flows wonderfully when you walk. i've gotten a ton of compliments on it. i'm 5'9" and the high hem falls a few inches below my knee, and the low hem falls to my ankles.
other Big pockets make it look more like a bathrobe than a coat. there are no internal pockets and the loops for the belt are pretty skimpy - just a bit of string. the color is great, but the quality leaves something to be desired.
other I was so excited for this top! it looks exactly as pictured. material is soft albeit slightly see through but if you wear a nude bra, it's fine. i love the ruffle details and it's very comfortable. i'm 5'7", 140 with an athletic, hourglass shape, 32dd chest. i bought the small and it's perfect. the medium would have been a little looser fitting with more drape but i enjoy the fitted look. don't pass this up. great price point and sure to be a staple.
other It is a pretty tank, the fabric feels nice and substantial.
other These are truly slouchy leggings. i am short (5'3) so they do bunch quite a bit for me but when paired with a long chunky sweater they are perfect! unlike the other review, i felt that they ran a little on the larger side. i am typically an 8/10 and ordered the m/l. they sit nicely on my lower waist and do not sag but the length is long long long. i recommend these for wearing out or around the house.
other As other reviewers have said ~ the colors are more muted but good fall colors! quality top with lining and bead detail on hem and sleeves. flowy, loose fit ~ very cute with skinny jeans and booties. i would size down if you are small chested. great boho top.
other Absolutely in love with this dress! perfect to wear to work or for a casual brunch or cookout. i'm a 34b, 27" waist, and 36" hip and 5'3" and went with the xsp. very impressed with the quality and well worth the sale price.
3 This is a relatively cute top when you try it on. however, i don't think it will hold it's shape after even just other wear. it also doesn't seem like you could wash it without ruining it (like a shirt form a 'throw-away' cheap clothing store). i checked the fabric tag and it is a very high % viscose - meaning, it won't last long at all. i'm returning and feel frustrated with how cheap the fabric is.
other Bought this cami/tank on sale which i'm glad but it has a flap underneath like a bralette but not fitted..it kinda just drapes under the cami...the problem is it's not thick enough to offer the coverage you would want under a white tank ...but it was also too short so it caused a visible line underneath that showed through.that was higher than the bottom of my chest ..so it gave the appearance that i wore the wrong bra/undergarment...it simply looks awkward ...not sure if it would've been better
other This dress is gorjuss!! i thought i would be in between a 10-12, but after trying on the 8 in the store--i'm a perfect 10. i was a little nervous about the price, but then i said, "treat yoself!" and made the leap and didn't look back. i felt so confident wearing this to a wedding and received so many compliments. i wanted a dress that made me feel sexy, without showing so much skin--this achieved it all! make the purchase--you won't regret it :-)i'm 5'8, 195lbs and the 10 was spot on!
other Living in florida, i thought the design of this sweatshirt was to die for. i was so pleased with the quality when i received the top; however i was nervous to see that it recommended washing before wearing due to the dying process. i washed cold gentle cycle and tumble dried low. turned out perfect and did not shrink! it's adorable. plan to wear it with white denim shorts. i ordered a size other and i normally wear a size small.
other -i normally don't go for these tops because with my hourglass frame and wider hips, it only makes me look wider. however, like others, i was drawn to the fabric and feel.the bottom half really is lovely and looks expensive, and the top half is stretchy an
other I absolutely love this top! it is soft, comfortable and perfectly flowy. this is definitely my favorite go to casual summer top.
other I ordered it with a particular outfit in mind as i liked the purple (burgundy) color. ordered xxsp, as with most t-shirts at retailer, they run a little big. xxs seems to be my new xs (which used to be s!).color was nice , fit was good too, i just felt not "special" enough... but if you are looking for a tshirt, then i say give it a try, as it was comfortable and the shape at least is unusual.for reference, 11other lbs, 30dd, 26.other in waist
3 Just a warning, the yoke on this dress has sequins underneath. i'm not a sparkle kinda gal, so as soon as i saw that, the dress went right back in the package and will be going back to the store. i wish that had been described or more evident in the pictures, to me, it cheapens the whole dress, which would otherwise be adorable.
other I got this in light green and it's a gorgeous color. first tried a small, but it was a little too wide and long. exchanged for xs, looks great. now i just hope it doesn't shrink too much!
other I aded this in my basket at hte last mintue to see what it would look like in person. (store pick up). i went with teh darkler color only because i am so pale :-) hte color is really gorgeous, and turns out it mathced everythiing i was trying on with it prefectly. it is a little baggy on me and hte xs is hte msallet size (bummer, no petite). i decided to jkeep it though, because as i said, it matvehd everything. my ejans, pants, and the 3 skirts i waas trying on (of which i ]kept all ) oops.
3 I loved this blouse, but had to return. i am 5'2", 127 lbs. 36d. i found that the blouse was tight in the bust and very wide in the shoulders. the sleeves are puffy, which is fine, but the wideness is from edge of the bib to where the sleeve is attached and therefore the top did not lay flat. if you have wide shoulders and a small bust - this blouse will be perfect for you. i liked the material, it was thin but perfect for a summer nights.
3 This is a pretty top but the arm sleeves are scratchy. i have sensitive skin, and had to return it because of this. otherwise, it would have been a keeper.
other I agree with the other reviewers, this top is completely disappointing in every way, i could not believe it was the same top i pulled from the bag. where to begin,.......it runs really bigit's short and boxy, not at all like it appears on the model, this must be pinned a lot in this picture.colors are completely dull in person, i really think this picture was lightened a great deal.fabric feels cheap and stifflining is stuff and poorly sewn.i haven't one positive thing to say about t
3 This is a beautiful dress. i sized up other sizes based on other reviews and it fits well. it is on the shorter side. i purchased the blue and it's a beautiful color. i was in love with the dress until the zipper burst open after wearing it for five minutes. i think i'm going to have the zipper replaced because i like it so much. but at the high price point there should be a functional zipper.
other This is a pretty blouse but everything else you wear with it needs to be sharp because it can be dowdy otherwise.
other I ordered this in black and loved it so much, i ordered the 'red' color too. it hasn't arrived yet, but i'm hoping its tan like it appears to be online. it fits tts (5'3" and 110lbs) - the xs fit perfectly and wasn't too long.
other This dress is lovely. the colors seem a bit more muted than as reflected on model; otherwise, looks very similar to photo. it has a slimline style and is very flattering. the dress has a more casual appearance than as is reflected in the photo. its really more of a day dress than a special occasion dress, notwithstanding another reviewer's opinion to the contrary.i ordered up a size due to reading other reviews. i found it to be a bit larger than i wanted so i washed and tumble dried it on low
other I love this dress! it fits me so well and is extremely comfortable. i can't wait until it gets a little warmer so i can wear it with a trench and cute flats or heeled sandals.
other This dress is stunning! my sister-in-law was hoping to use it as a bridesmaid dress for her wedding and i ordered it for fitting purposes. it fit beautifully on my 5'10" frame. unfortunately she decided against it due to availability and because of the length on the shorter bridesmaids. while it fell to a couple inches above my ankles, it made the shorter girls look shorter. i ended up returning it but am regretting not keeping it now!
other This top is beautiful.  at the present price, grab it.  the fit was tts for me, a bit loose if anything.  the blue green color, which is not pictured, is shown in my uploaded photos.
other This is the second of the new dress batch i have purchased and it is lovely. this catalog shot does not do it justice.the colors are brighter, but not neon, lots of indigo and coral. there is a tad of yellow? the bodice makes my aa size look much "more." the bodice fits me perfectly as the top pleating is flat. the v neck is just right - not too low, and the back is even prettier.the dress just fell gracefully out of the package without a wrinkle and without a mussed pleat! that was a sh
other I bought this shirt in every color. i look sexy and the best part is how comfortable it is. it is very versatile. i wear it at networking semi formal events/ dinners/ going out with friends, and everywhere. i feel awesome with it.
other This dress is so pretty and the neckline is darling!
other I love the cut and "swing" of this tee. the royal blue is very saturated and pretty.
other This is an interesting skirt. the fabric is comfortable, breathable and flowy. it is eye-catching. but the pattern is not one i would say i love, although i do like it. the lighter color in the pattern is more pink than off-white, which is fine, but that did surprise me a little. overall, i kept it for comfort and because i liked it enough for the sale price i paid for it.
other I got these jeans on sale and have been very happy with them. they seem to go with everything - just a really nice basic skinny jean to have. lightweight with a little bit of give. they fit tts for me, and hit about an inch and a half longer on my legs than the model in the picture (i'm 5'6"). i've had them for a couple of months now and keep expecting them to show some wear in the knees bc of how often i wear them. not yet! any marks on them have come off easily in the wash. overall, very happy
other This dress is cute and the a line style is quite flattering. a few minor issues: fabric is linen not denim as the name states, petite sizing is still a little large and back zipper doesn't zip down far enough to step into so has to be pulled over head (not that big of a deal). for reference i'm 5'4, 120, 32d and i ordered a petite size other and it was a bit large and fell bellow my knees. will be returning for a size 2. fingers crossed!
other Got the jacket in blue xs, i am 5-1, 110 lbs. fits great and wanted the beige one too! however the beige color ones have a totally different fit! the beige jackets run big and i was swimming in the xs, hence the mixed reviews from other peeps.
other This jacket has a nautical look which is a refreshing change for this year. it is double breasted & a stretchy cotton, which i love. i am a big fan of cotton. it appealed to me so much that i ordered both the white & the navy in the regular size small. i am of small build at 5'3", 117# & expected that the sleeves c/b a little long. i avoid ordering petite size jackets b/c sometimes they are snug in the shoulders. ok, so the regular s was a good length at the bottom of my hips, but arms were bagg
other Great buy. i bought the cream jumpsuit.  i'm small on bottom and larger on top. this was perfect, shouldn't fit tight, should flow, has lots of room, it is linen, adjustable buttons on front and adjustable on the back of jumpsuit. legs are wide and flowy. casual but classy. both sides have about 3 buttons at hips. great addition to any closet. unique in its own right.
other Superb quality and design. i am a 34d and 120lbs. i am a size 6 to 8 but mostly 8 due to my hips and top. i am pear shaped and 5'6. the dress was a little loose but i just need to get it a little fitted but you can hardly tell. i love the floral patterned so intricate. it truly looks like a princess dress. it is little heavy and at least it's not too tight for dancing.
other I had to keep rechecking the price tag on this one to be sure i saw it correctly. price aside though, it's really awesome. fit is flattering, stripes are cute, colors are nice, and you can wear it all summer long. if you can get over the dollar signs, it's a keeper!
other Bought this skirt in the light plum color. nice soft corduroy fabric.it fit well. not too short. will be cute this fall with a sweater and boots. my only complaint. i wish it had pockets.
3 I was very excited to get this dress in the mail. i wasn't sure about the sizing because there weren't any reviews written yet. i got the m which fit across my chest area and fit fine, but there was just so much fabric below the bust. i love that it's different, but i think you'd have to be a stick figure for this shape to work for you. it does not flatter your body at all.
3 I got this in the green color. it's a beautiful color, soft to the touch. i agree with other reviewers that it seems very delicate. i don't mind dry-cleaning my sweaters, so that's not the issue. the problem is that a. it runs huge - i got the small and it swims on me. i tend to run between small and medium in tops - very unusual to have a small be so big on me and b. the slits go even higher than they look on the model - they come up to the top of my waist. even with high-waisted pants, the sli
other I bought this dress in black and i think it will be a great piece to transition with but definitely great during summer. doesn't come down too low on me which is sometimes an issue. the arm holes seem to be on the larger side. i'm 5'3 so it is not this short on me. i'm really happy with this purchase. plus it has pockets!
other This brand always makes the softest tees, and so i buy several each season. when i saw this one online, i worried that it might be too long for my short waist, but i decided to order it anyway. success! i ordered my usual size m (for knit tops - 10/1other in fitted ones), and the length was perfect due to the buttons on the side.fyi: short waist, broad shoulders/back, 36c - i carry my weight in the middle, since i virtually do not have a waistline. so a longer, boxy tee will emphasize the parts of
3 Was excited about this sweater but it really didn't wow me when i put it on. the v-neck is quite low and the sweater is a bit short. loved the ideas of the fringe but in the end, it went back.
other I spend a lot of time on the retailer website. it never occurred to me to try this dress. a salesperson suggested it in the store and i tried it on. it is really cute on. i bought a thrift store denim jacket to throw over it. the only con is the sleeves. i am 5'3' and my arms are not very long. the bell sleeves are a little crazy on me, but they will be hidden under the jacket.
other I saw this top online and fell in love with it, as i live in white cotton comfy tanks, but i was concerned that it might make me look like i was wearing a tent from the side profile since i am top heavy - 36d, and i happen to have this problem with some tops and dresses. so i went into the store to try it on in a size l and i was shocked how not only did it not look like a tent it had a slimming effect! i felt so attractive in it i had a hard time looking at myself in the mirror (believe me this
other Fit is oversized but intentional. flattering on. love the neckline. modesty might call for a tank top underneath if bending over. fabric is soft, stretchy and has a good quality heft to it.
other This coat won't take me through a cold boston winter, but i will be willing to sacrifice a little warmth in order to take this beauty out for a night on the town. it's chic, slim, elongating and bold. it looks fantastic paired with some bold tall boots and solid colors underneath. as for sizing, i tend to disagree with most "runs small" reviews, but this baby runs small. especially if you really do live in a cold climate and intend to wear something substantial underneath. my bust measurement is
other This dress is a beautiful cut, and thankfully, it comes in petite so it fit my frame. i ordered it in my usual size in both 2r and 2p and will be returning the r. checks are cute and can be dressed up for work or for social event depending on goal. fabric is a little scratchy but texture and cut are great.
other What a perfect summer dress! after reading the previous review i ordered a size up and it's perfect. the slip is a little snug on the hips, but most dresses are on me so i think on most people it would fit very well as long as you ordered one size larger. i can't wait to wear this while traveling through europe next summer!
other What attracted me to this beautiful piece is the lure of angel of the north quality and design. i know that this sweater/jacket will be worn and enjoyed this fall / winter and years to come; it's a classic beauty. when i put it on, it has a comfortable vibe, high quality, medium weight, dark black wool, and beautiful lines. i love the deep collar, slightly lower back hem, and inverted pleat at back waist to give a slight flare to the drape .it accents a feminine look and will be an invaluable st
other I love all paige denim. i have the flared which i purchased in july and now the skinny. i got the zara ones last year which are a copy obviously and they are just not the same. the ones last year the paige sierra sold out fast but luckily these are here. i actually like these more because they are more worn looking. you can even wear a pretty top underneath to enhance them.
other I ordered this top from store. i'm 5'3" and 11other lbs, i ordered size 4, fir very nice, just front is little to low for me, but i wear ten top , it will be fine. the style and material are amazing, love it!
other I ordered the blue in size xl. it's even prettier in person. the fit runs a little smaller/shorter on me than shown on the model. i'm other ft. other 1/other in. for reference. i love the detailed stitching. it is delicate and can catch. my dog's claw pulled on it and i had to reweave the thread back. i've washed mine twice, reshaped & air-dried. it didn't shrink much at all. it's perfect for spring & summer. i've gotten a lot of compliments on the shade of blue. it's really so pretty.
other I love this fabric, it is comfortable and forgiving. as i prefer jewel tone colors and the red is beautiful. i thought the sleeve length on this might be odd, but it's fabulous. the only reason i haven't given it five stars is that i haven't laundered it enough to verify the quality
other Super comfortable and cute!! i have received tons of compliments one this dress. the material is soft and the print/colors are awesome. this dress will get a lot of use over fall, winter and spring. runs a little big. i am typically a s but chose the xs . love love love!
other I've never spent this much money on a sweater but took the plunge using the retailer day discount. still painful but hopeful it would be worth it. i ordered the xl hoping to compensate for the shorter length. and it fell just below my hip bones so that part was okay. while this looks like the cashmere is on the thinner side, so the garment flows nicely, it's not. the weight of the sweater is substantial, heavier and much thicker than it looks. the color is different too. it's tan and grey, not whi
other I really like this shirt. i almost didn't order it based on the other reviews, but its cute and comfortable! i didn't get the white color, so that may be why mine is not see through. i just wear it with a bra and its good to go!
other I ordered this in the peach color and it is a beautiful pale color. the underside of the cuff has a pretty pattern on it, so if you roll it up once it adds a little something extra! it is extremely see through though so you might want to wear a tank under!
3 I love the style of this top, and the longer length would be great with leggings and fitted shorts. it's somewhat fitted on the top yet it's a-line shape gives a full swing at the bottom. the ruffled v-neckline is pretty, and i like the longer length of the short sleeves. but with all these attributes, unfortunately they cut the armholes really big, so when you put your arms forward, the sleeves pull against your arms. i was trying to decide if i should keep it anyway, but for $98 dollars i thin
other Very pretty and delicate top. it is fresh and with a delicate embroidered "bib" style. the fabric on the front is silky and the back is a blend of silk and cotton, just that part (the back) could be a little thicker so more durability. still as it is, it's a niece piece and good quality.i find it you can wear it with dress pants for office or formal gathering and to dress up jeans and either to leave it our or tuck in. since the bib is focal point you can skip any necklace and war dainty earrin
other I just love these! i ordered these in both the lighter and darker denim in my usual size 28. they fit just right, just like my other pilcro jeans. i'm only 5' and the petite version was not available so i will have to get them altered but that's typical. i love the wash in each of them and the distressing is good, not over-the-top. i'm so glad i got these! and the sale price was a bonus!
other Soft pretty socks. a little big if you have smaller feet. i'm a size 7.5, and they are a tad too big but still comfortable.
other These jeans were a pleasant surprise. they are comfy, stretchy and fit right at the ankle. i have skinny legs and i love that these are a slim fit .i am normally a 27 waist but the 26 had a better fit. the dark demin and the gold buttons give it a dressy look. they also give my derriere a nice shape. i am 5?2?, 116 lbs and i have slim hips. to top it off, the jeans were an additonal 30% off the sale price!
other I joked with my husband that if i were with the resistance  (star wars), this is what i would wear! i actually really like it. it will look best with a girly skirt and blouse. the quilting is lightweight and the fit is slim. well made too.
3 I love the style, but it didn't work for me. i ordered the r size. they were way too too long. i generally wear size 26, and the r length works with most retailer pants. with this particular pant, i could barely pull up the zipper. i'm not sure what happened bc i haven't gained any additional weight. i am 5'2, and 110 lbs. unfortunately, i had to return the pants. i think the design is for supermodels. maybe a petite size would have worked? the p was out of stock. good luck!
other I've only worn the sweater a handful of times, but i'm already in love with how soft and comfortable it is. it's a bit on the baggier side, but that doesn't stop it from looking great. i've gotten complements on it every time i've worn it. i would highly recommend it to people who don't like the typical scratchy/itchy textiles.
3 I adore eva franco but these are just not thoughtfully designed regarding fit. i wear a size 1other and took the risk of ordering the 1other as a popback, but they do fit 1-other sizes small. i could get them zipped but it's not a good look. i feel like the waist would fit if the rise weren't so short. for reference, i have a 33" waist and 42" hips.
other It took me a while to finally try this on after seeing it in store for a while, i wasn't sure about the color. then i saw it matched with the brush stroke charlie trousers (which i had just purchased) and loved the combination so much i had to finally try it. i love the fit and feel of this top. i agree with a poster before that the photo does not do this top justice. my only wish is that t was a touch longer.
other This is my go to top during the not so cold winter days.. can't be dressed up or down..
other I ordered this dress to possibly wear to my wedding rehearsal dinner. i an adding this review to give some guidance on sizing. i am size 34a and own two other dresses by this designer in size 2. for this dress, however, i had to size up to a other in order to close the side zip. i'm 5'7" and the dress hit me just above the knee. (in my opinion, it would have been more elegant if it was a little longer.) the color combo with the taupe and off white is unique, but wasn't particularly flattering on my
other I got this in blue and also in white, both size medium. it's a very comfy casual top and i love the horseshoe neckline and front facing seaming which makes it just a bit different. however....i can't figure out why the blue color fits quite a bit smaller than the white. but it does, so consider this when you order, depending upon how you want it to fit. i'm keeping both but will wear the blue in a different way, definitely not with leggings.
other I purchased this on a whim and i'm so glad i did. this is a gorgeous piece. fabric is soft very feminine and stylish. quality is outstanding. it can be worn with a dress or jeans. lovely shades of pink and soft gray. i live in florida, so it's a bit heavy for hotter weather, but will be great on a cool spring day. love it!
other I like the skirt. that said it is going to the tailor to have some of the fullness taken out. just a lot of material going on, and heavier than you might have imagined. i will wear it fall & winter with white & navy cardigans.
other This dress is gorgeous. i purchased it recently to wear to my civil wedding ceremony and it is absolutely perfect. it is light, flowy, and comfortable, but the details make it special. the sheer sleeves give it ethereal vibe that i love. the quality seems to be extremely high as well. if you are looking for a white dress that is casual, but still unique and beautiful, please give this one a shot. i cannot wait to wear it on my special day!
other I love the design and fit and quality. have been looking for a long-line top like this and was willing to pay full price. i have that dreadful little roll right under my bust line and this sucks everything in nicely. smooths it all out. i'm a 38c and everything was contained nicely and fit great in the large top. here's my issue - wore it once and the colors ran! i was so excited to wear this i didn't even wash the top (i rinsed and dried the bottom, though). and i'm not a swimmer. just let
other So let me start by saying i love non-skinny cut jeans. i'm a curvy athletic type with thick legs, so when a jeans comes around with a "generous" fit, i'm thrilled! these jeans are generously cut through the hips and waist, giving it a boyfriend type of cut. the denim is soft, like your old favorite pair of jeans that have been washed 1000 times. i did size down one size and probably could have gone down one more size, but i still want a bit of a looser cut. pilcro denim always has stretch in the
other I am 5'2" and got this in a 6p. i would say it fits tts (the top also has some give), but the waist is just a few inches away from being empire. i think the dress on the model is pulled down to de-emphasize this. even so, it is a very cute dress - plan to wear it with a navy velvet jacket for easter.
other I really love this dress. i cannot believe how many people have complimented me on this dress and ask where i bought it. the color is so soft and pretty. the dress is comfortable as well. it looks great with a light pair of wedges.
other This dress is comfortable, hugs and skims at all the right places, and sports a perfect length for a shortie like me. wish the other patterns weren't sold out.
3 I ordered a m as the previous review said it ran small. i found it to be very large. i have more curves than the model and also thought it made me look boxy.
other I ordered the white and the light blue in size xl. both are cut much smaller than is typical for my other retailer xl blouses. everything the first reviewer wrote is true. the photos of the white top show a detailed back when it is plain (like the blue). the back is just a solid, kind of slippery material. it's strange because it's not see-through in the back but you need to wear a tank/cami for the front. so, it makes the shirt that much tighter since you need to have the extra layer. i would
other I love the cut of this dress! i have to be honest and say that i initially bought the blue color at the store and after falling in love i decided that i deserved to have the mango colored one as well after seeing my sister in it! the sizing is just a tab big but it works for the design. so i would say stick with your usual size. amazing pop of color especially for summer. the back design is gorgeous and the gold streaks running through it  are wonderful. do yourselves a favor and just try it on!
other This is just the cutest dress on. i love the way the plaid comes together in the seams and the fullness of the skirt. i almost didn't order it, but then i left something in my cart too long and it was gone. this was my next choice. i haven't had the chance to wear it yet. but the wrinkles pressed out beautifully and it is hanging in my closet waiting for an event. i will wear it without a bra since even with my strapless, the bra shows in the front. i think if you want to wear a bra it would be
other I can?t describe my love for this sweater! simple, to go outfit paired with jeans and boots, it?s an easy go-to sweater in a pinch on a cold day. i have sensitive skin, so i wore a tank underneath and was fine. loved getting this sweater with the extra 40% sale price! i purchased the medium (2) and it was tts.
other This is a great swingy tank for summer and the smocking adds a nice design element to an otherwise plain white top. i typically wear a l, sometimes xl in tops from retailer, but the l in this is pretty loose - i am hoping it will shrink down quite a bit in the wash. otherwise i really love the top, and now that it's on sale, the price is definitely right! i wish the black one was still available!
3 I thought that it looked like it belonged on a 1other year-old. i can almost see why they styled the model in what looks like ankle socks....ready for cheerleading. for reference it fits true to size, but is very short. i am 5'2" and tried on a regular small - it was at least other inches above my knee.
other I received these pants today and they're perfect. as another reviewer stated, "i would definitely not wear these for lounging" you can dress them up or down. i feel like these will be my favorite go-to pants this spring. i highly recommend the design and pockets are perfect
other The shirt was better than it actually looked online. the only downfall was that there was a pulled thread on the shirt when i received it. it's something i can probably fix, just a little disappointed receiving in that shape.i would recommend this top. very flattering and dressy if you want it to be.
other Tried this little gem on in the store but they were out of my size. the ladies were so helpful, ordered it, shipped to me directly and i received it amazingly fast - not an easy task when you live off grid in north idaho!i wore it last night to a st patrick's day party in california and received a ton of compliments. paired it with black leggings and strap or black heels. i'm still smiling today, can't wait to wear it again. the fit is flattering and the quality superb.thanks retailer
other This is a cute, casual romper but i'm on the fence about keeping it. i hate when there is a pattern mismatch - especially across the butt and that's why i'm on the fence. i bought my usual xs/0, (5'7", 115lbs, 32b). i would say that it is a little roomy around the bust - if i keep it i might have to have it altered slightly to stop my bra from showing. this is the first jumpsuit that i have tried that actually accommodates my longer torso - so many seem to ride up and that is not flattering!wi
other This dress will unfortunately be returned...so cute online and looks like a sack in person.  runs very large, arm holes are very low.  not flattering.
other I just received this dress after ordering it online and i'm already in love. the fit is perfect - i tend to have issues with bust areas of dresses being too small and this fits just right. the material is light and perfect for southwest florida.
other I love lace dresses and this one is no exception. great construction and color. i paired the dress with a plum colored blazer and i really was pleased at how well it all went together. i'm about 5'8" and 170 i'm normally an 8 or 10 at retailer, my 8 fits great and is not tight at all, so i'm thinking it may run a tad bit big.
other Love, love, love this sweater. it is so comfy and well made. this is a piece i will have for a very long time. the beautiful lace detail are the sleeves are to die for. picture doesn't do this sweater justice.
other I usually wear a 27 in ag and other designer jeans. i ordered a 29 based on the other reviewers. they fit like the model and look great. i might have been able to go with 28 if these end up stretching out, so i'm hoping they don't. they are nice and thick for white jeans, yet soft and comfy.
other I was so excited for this to come in the mail, once i got it and opened it up i actually went back to verify this was in fact pajamas! it is great quality and super soft! some positives were that it has pockets! (who knew?!) and like stated before it is super soft and comfortable. the only negative is that it is not physically attractive, it is very baggy and it a-lines out. it's fine its pajamas but if you are wanting something cute for bed and you have a straight body this may not be the answe
other I absolutely love this top. i thought it was going to be to big but it fits perfectly. fitted and flattering.
other Whimsical and elegant. fits a bit snug in rib cage, but that works well for me. i'm a 32c.
other I bought the wine color. typically wear med or large., med was plenty big.... the color is deep and beautiful. is so soft and flowing. i love it!
other Note the sleeves on the model. that is how your regular size will fit your arms. however, even if you have skinny arms like i do, the sleeves will be tight. i bought my regular size xs and it was clingy with an odd flair and the length seems as though i ordered a petite and i am only other ft other in.i advise to try a few sizes on if you really are interested. the red is truly a red which is a good thing because so often it is hard to find a red that is not neon.
other I ordered this top in rose. (the color is actually more of a cream with navy and yellow stripes but i could tell that from the photo when i was ordering). the fit is true to size and the cut is very flattering. excited to add this gem to my summer wardrobe!
other Lovely sweater, good quality fabric, pretty color. as the reviewer say, it is very thick wool pile, if warm is not what you're looking for, you may want to think twice.
other I found my experience odering the moon lake maxi skirt very easy. i received the skirt in a timely manner and am very happy with my purchase.
other Great cut & fit! the length is perfect, too. i like the weight of the skirt overall. good for all seasons.
other I love, love this trench! i bought the grey, and it goes well with so many other pieces! i can dress it up for work or wear it out for brunch on the weekend. it's a great layering piece for the san francisco weather i'm adjusting to!it does run a little big, but i don't mind because it gives enough room for layering. i'm short at 5'3 but still stuck with a small-- a small petite probably would look great as well!hei hei consistently makes great jackets/trenches :)
other I was immediately drawn to this top in the catalog. when my local retailer had it in stock and in my size, i tried it on. it fit so well - the front wasn't too low and the back was fantastic with its multiple straps. i wore it the same week to a dinner with friends. i like the multiple prints and the navy blue edging. i bought the turquoise necklace too because it topped off the look so well. the fabric is silky but washable. the top is very well made and fun to wear.
other I did not like the fit of this. as another reviewer stated, it is not a swing tunic. it hangs fairly straight. i don't have large hips. i'm 5'8" and 120 lbs with a full bust and this did not look flattering. i returned it immediately.
other I purchased this top on sale and it's almost perfect. the pleats under the rib cage make the bottom bell out a little bit - not enough to make me want to return it, but i'm glad i didn't pay full price!
other I'm surprised by the negative reviews and i'm here to come to its defense! i love this dress! i'm solidly a 0 petite in tracy reese and this fit perfectly. the top isn't snug but it's not roomy enough to say it runs large. just perfectly comfortable. the belt was a little tricky because it has to thread through several loops, but it stays put nicely and fit perfectly without being too snug or uncomfortable. the fitted top with the belt offsets the fit and flare style of the skirt. lace is beauti
3 I'm 5'6'' , athletic build-thought it was cute but in the end didn't like the color of the inner sweatshirt--wish it was black or white. send it back.
other My waist measures 28" and the size other is a snug fit. i normally buy size other in retailer skirts, but the other was unbearably tight. cute skirt though! i like that it's machine washable, and the quality looks good.
other This is a beautifu;l dress. unfortunately it runs extremely large. i wear sized 10-1other and ordered l. i was lost in all the material. but because i love this dress so much, i am taking a chance and ordered it in small.
other I ordered this top in xs and blue, its subtle but pretty on, as the style gives it a boost. it is a bit snug in the shoulders (cut a little snug in armpit?) but i would not want it larger. it does not affect the appearance, is not uncomfortable, just noticeable when moving arms around. nice fall top, want to try with blue or white jeans and boots.
other I took this sweater on a recent vacation up north. i wore it 3 evenings because the weather changed from hot to cool. loved the feel of being wrapped in a warm blanket. cocoon cardigan is an apt name. wasn't sure about pink but it is exactly as pictured. this will become a go-to in my sweater wardrobe.
other The smocking is beautiful. the fabric is soft and flowy, it is not too sheer for work. the blouse fits tts. i have this in 3 colors and take the xs and have even bought the xxs. for reference, i am a 3other b.5'8" and 110lbs. it is a nice layering length and is not boxy. the armholes fit nicely. i wish they still had the blue.
other Nice quality, not too thin like most white tops and the arms are cut just right. perfect length too.
other Great jeans. especially if you are on the shorter side (other ft 3 for example). they run very large. i typically buy size 28/29 and bought a size 27 and had a tailor take in the waist a bit. i'm syked for these for fall!
other I was very nervous to buy this top, but because it was on such an excellent sale i went for it- tops like this usually end in me showing a ridiculous amount of cleavage or not being able to zip (i am a 32ddd) it past my waist. i ordered a small based on the other reviews and it fits perfectly! the wrap top is perfect and shows off my curves without showing too much. the fabric is very unique and the whole top is lined with a nice nylon/cotton blend so it is very soft and comfortable to wear. def
other 1. i'm 5'5" tall, 14other lbs, and 38-32-40. i wear a size 30 in hyphen chinos and they are loose. i could get in a size 10, but i felt the stretchiness made it look like it was pulling slightly. i decided to get the size 1other even though it was a hair loose.2. the skirt hem is right above my knees. it's not as short as it appears on the model.3. the back pockets are sewn shut, so they won't sag.4. my only complaint is that the hook and eye at the waist pulls away funny, but i'm going to t
other Totally bummed. the pretty print doesn't outweigh the very odd fit of this dress. makes you look really top heavy and even the print, which looks so cute online, looks muddled in person. sadly, went right back.
other The dahlia bell sleeve blouse is absolutely gorgeous in my opinion. i have already worn it several times, with white cropped denim or the cropped fringed pilcro denim jeans. it also looks great with the pilcro rolled shorts in navy or white. i took my usual size large, and though the fabric seems like it may be sheer, if you wear a nude bra you do not need a cami beneath. the blue band hits right about the waist of your jeans so your jeans don't show thru either. this blouse is lightweight and v
other These are my favorite pair of capris/ankle jeans ever! i'm 5'4", 120lbs and got the 28 petite in gray. the fit is fantastic and the length is perfect for summer days (couple inches above my ankles). the gray color is so versatile and i can dress it up or down. i plan on getting it in other colors as well since the fit is so good.
3 Love the colors, love the design, and sure to keep you toasty. im usually a size 0 or other so i ordered an extra small- it felt a bit roomie
other Love this shirt! got it in white and it will be perfect for spring! very flattering fit!
other I had high hopes for this cool top. i ordered it in xxs because no petites were available at the time, and i think the size is just right (i'm +/- 10other lbs, 34aa). i just suspect it looks better on people with broad shoulders, like the models'; mine are kind of narrow. plus, crew necks aren't the most flattering neckline on me. i would say it's fairly short, just barely covering my belt, so on taller people it may be cropped, and the waist is kind of fitted, as shown. i love that it's cotton, mad
3 Very pretty and has potential. only down side - i thought it was more like a cardigan with sleeves but it's really more of a shawl and the photos and descriptions are misleading
3 I was so excited to try this dress, but after ready the reviews,i though they were all over the place! i descided to order my typical retailer size small. i'm 5'6" , 13other lbs, and wear a size 6. well, it was a snug fit! i have a slim build and this was just to snug for my taste. i imagine a medium would have been better. however, i was very surprised by the length and slit... the dress hit at my knee cap with the slit going all the way up to mid thigh... .!?? i've seen pics of this dress on instagr
other I was looking for a casual dress for quick errands that was trendy but comfy.  this dress had a lot of potential [i was drawn to the print]  but the material is awful. so thin and scratchy! immediately went back.
other The weight of this denim is perfect, thin enough for a nice drape and wearability for all seasons but still thick enough to be structured. though there is absolutely no stretch, which is probably why so many are finding it to run small. i am a true size 6, but find that most retailer brands run quite large, therefore i usually wear a other and that's what i purchased in this dress. the bodice is a bit snug, but not enough to size up, for me personally. i know it's mostly a spring/summer dress,
other I echo what the other reviews say - this is a tshirt but it's very flattering. i bought the black and dressed it with a bright turquoise necklace and received a ton of compliments. extremely comfortable. i've been just looking for this shirt when i get home from work or having to do errands because it is that comfortable.i'm buying more it's so comfortable and flattering.
other I purchased this jacket in red. i have several boiled wool jackets from retailer and this one did not disappoint. it is very warm and appears to be high quality. it looks good both snapped and open. i do believe that it runs large. i settled on an xxs petite and am just under 5'4".
other Very cute. a size small worked perfectly for me, fits like a glove. it has open sides so i wear a tank top under it.
other ...on this great vest. i wear it all the time. it's soft, pretty, warm and durable. love!
other This top is made from a thick, sweatshirt-type fabric, making it a nice choice for transitional weather. the details are quite unusual and lovely. i just got it and i've already worn it twice.
other This dress is so cozy and soft. love it! the cowl is big in a flattering way. absolutely adore the buttons that run down the back of the dress. such an unexpected detail which makes retailer pieces so special. i would layer tights and tank underneath anyway so the see through aspect other reviewers mentioned wasn't apparent to me and also wasn't as big a deal.
other Lovely foxy sweater. i dressed it down for work but would look fantastic with a pretty skirt too!
other This is a great pullover. very cute for lounging at home or running errands. it does run large, i ordered an xs & it's pretty big. for reference, i'm 5'7'', 12other lbs & 3other b. it is also a little pricey for lounge wear but i am keeping it because it is so cute.
other This is a beautiful long midi blazer that happens to feel like a sweatshirt. buy it! you'll look super classy and put together. i wear to work and going out. i've been noted to also curl up in bed wearing this because it's so comfortable and i forgot to switch into a sweatshirt. note i'm on the short side so the "blazer" ends up being a little longer for me. i happen to like it because it gives it a little more formalness of a longer coat while still being spring weight (jersey/terry on the
other I love this crushed velvet dress in the rich blue color . i plan to wear it with short peep toe boots and also with ankle leggings and flats. so glad velvet is in this year!
other I love the feminine feel and look of this skirt. it is unique and matches many different shirts and looks great with a jacket. the only thing is it does run large. i ordered a 6 (my usual size) and it is very loose, not form fitting like the photo, but still cute and wearable. downsizing would've been better.
other I got this in black and have no issue wearing a solid black bra under it. i felt it ran a little big. i'm a 34dd and usually have to wear a medium due to the "girls" but a small fit me and fit well. i didn't find it boxy and it fit me perfectly in the shoulders. i paid full price but i loved it so much i didn't mind. the sale price is amazing!
other For reference, i'm currently hovering in the 1other range for pants (called "curvy" on the lower half, hahaha), but purchased these in a 12. they are so flattering and comfortable, i returned to purchase a pair to keep stashed for when i wear out a pair and actually bought two pairs in a size 10 for when i loose weight. they look perfectly tailored! the fabric is substantial (more of a spring weight than summer), so you don't have to worry about showing skin beneath the unlined pant, and it drapes e
3 I was hoping to wear this dress for an engagement photoshoot but it fit terribly. i'm 5'0, 98 lbs, 32a, and have some hips/butt. this dress (ordered xxs petite) hugged my hip/butt region tightly, which made the dress ride up and balloon out around my stomach and back. there was also too much extra room in the chest, so sizing up was out of the question. there is just way too much fabric and it's very stiff with no drape or shape whatsoever. i felt like i was wearing a cardboard box. the sleeves
other I really did want to love these jeans but i had to return them. im a size 10 and a little heavier in the thighs and got a 30. the rise is just to high for me and the thigh was very tight. the denim felt fabulous they just fit me a bit funky.
other This gorgeous dress really does bloom before your eyes. the silk is light, airy and very delicate. the bodice runs large and the length runs long (i have to wear my highest platforms) but i would not return because it's an exquisite piece of art.
other This duster is light weight - good for a inside a chilly restaurant, but not really warm enough for cold outdoor winter weather.really punches up a black on black outfit. polished, artsy, interesting look. runs large. has a feel similar to a swing coat - with less swing.i've received many compliments on this piece. wear it with confidence - it is on the bold side.
other I tried this on in-store and would have purchased if it have been a better price, it wasn't something i could justify spending $100 bucks on. it's cute and was surprisingly comfortable but again, not worth the asking price. i will buy when it goes on sale.
other This has quickly become my favorite sweater. i am thinking of getting another one in case mine wears out! it's comfy-cozy and soft. love it layered over t-shirts or long sleeved collared shirts, and am looking forward to trying it with a dress and bare legs once it's warmer out. it runs kind of big. i'm 5'8" and usually a size 6/8 and i got an xs. the s fit too.
other I bought this dress for an early fall wedding, i usually wear a size 1other and bought a large. it was loose and swingy, very comfortable, almost too big. i would size down if you are in between. this dress was so easy to wear, i would definitely bring it on vacation. you can pair any type of shoes- flats, sandals, heels, wedges would all look good.
other A cute dress. i did not have the issue with the slip being too tight. i wish it had a little more shape to it. while flowy, it looks a tiny bit tent-like. i still like it and wear it into fall with booties and boots!
other Sizing: i'm have broad shoulders/back, 36c (34d), short waist, and i usually wear a m in a knit top. that's what i bought, so i'd say that this tee is tts. it is a little longer in the back than front, but not as a high/low top would be. rather, it's sort of tunic-like in style. i have worn it over leggings with and without a sweater, and the added length covers me. i admit that i'm a tad on the short side at 5'2", and that i have no hips (straight up and down) and no waist. my shape is an upsid
other I am short (5'3'") and have a short torso so the empire waist line was really flattering. i got the petite size small and it fell just above my knee. loose skirt portion led to an easy look to the dress. overall, super cute!
other The top is really pretty. it is sheer and needs a camisole. wish the material was a little softer. think it fits true to size.
other I absolutely love this dress! it's great for business casual. it's also such a great color for the transition into fall.
other These leggings are wonderful. they are incredibly soft, and stay in place when working out.
other I was so excited when these pants went on sale! tried them on in-store and ordered online. tried both medium and small and they both work, thanks to the elastic waistline. they do run very long, so if you're super tall these are great, otherwise prepare to wear very tall heels or get them hemmed.
other I ordered this shirt online without seeing it in person, and it is great! it is true to size (if not slightly loose fitting) and a thick cottony-material with a pretty design. could be nice for spring, summer, or even fall with a cardigan.
other This sweater is a grand-dad style sweater. i love the pattern of the fabric. it does run a bit large, especially in the length of the sleeves. it definitely fits a more "oversized" sort of look. i find it very comfortable & perfect for a casual/weekend outfit.
other Wow, this sweater is, as other reviewers have said, perfect weight and the colors are vibrant and will work well with fall colors! i'm 5'11" so i'm always hoping the length works and in this case it does! i am very happy with this!
other This dress is flattering in all the right places. it has a gorgeous skirt with a comfortable, form-fitting top. it provides just the right amount of coverage. i love it so much i bought it in two colors!
other This dress is absolutely beautiful! it fits like a glove and the material is super soft. so in love with this! i'm 5'2'm and normally a xs/s. the xspwas a better fit in the waist and chest. the arm holes were a bit tighter on me. the sp was way too large.
other This fabric feels a little bit like heaven. i would totally wear this out and not just with my jammies. it's adorable and the fabric is so soft. i think i'm in love. i'm 5'other 9other lbs. xxsmall was a perfect fit.
other Purchased for myself and loved the fabric and unique design. it runs very large and the size smaller was not available so it was returned.
other I tried this on the other day at the local store in a size xs/s. although it's wool i didn't notice that is was itchy & usually wool bothers me. i am of small build but i did like the long & oversized look. i admit i am drawn to the print anyways. i noticed the right armhole was larger than the left so i tried on another xs/s - it was the same. probably the armholes will be smaller in the petite sizes. i decided to make other purchases but will order the petite xs/s in a few wks since the invent
other Love this! saw online, didn't place the order and when i came back it was gone. retailer restocked so i got it second time around. ordered the red option. this shirt is beautiful! sometimes the online photos don't do the piece justice, but this time, it's even better in person. the embroidered detail is gorgeous, the fabric is light weight, and the back of the shirt has button down panels that are almost linen-like in look and feel. the fit is just as pictured imo. bringing this on vacation with m
other Cute top, wish they had xxs. looks great with jeans and a fun necklace like pix. i got an xs (5'other and 13other lbs) and it's still a little wider than i would prefer, but i'm not a skinny jeans gal so might look better with those. i decided to keep it since no xxs. wore all day with jeans for a more casual event, then added a skirt and high heels later for a theater show. super comfortable and looks great for all occasions.
other I have purchased several pairs of these pants and love them. i got two pairs last fall, one in purple and one in red. i purchased a pair in sand this spring, and just purchased pairs in the violet and taupe last week. i purchased the violet to replace the purple pair i bought last year (stained them then first time i wore them). these pants are great, but the violet color doesn't quite match the color in the picture (which looks very similar to the pair i bought last year). in person, the violet
other I agree with the other reviewer, this skirt is has beautiful print combed cotton with a sheen. it is kind of stiff with a little give, a perfect a line. the waist is a little tight so i sized up, usually wear a other and the other was perfect for me. wore it to a show last night and was super comfortable and pretty all in one.
other Really cute, really comfy, great color, love the oversize buttons! all around just a great skirt. nice shade that goes right into fall. i have several of this style skirt and love them all!
other Great too. love it's flow. dolan is a great brand. however it's definitely large and baggy which is fine just know it's not tight. i'm 5' 10" and 13other and ordered a s.
other I bought these in my usual size 28 and they were much too loose so i returned them. i definitely need a 27 (39 inch hips, 33 low waist, 3other waist). i have lost a few pounds but i am usually a size 4-6 in pants. even loose i can see the pants are flattering and long enough for my leggy 5' 9" frame. they are still cropped but i would say look much the same as on the model. if you are shorter, i think the petite option would be necessary to achieve a cropped look. the material is not bright white wi
other I am a curvy girl with boobs! this dress was perfect. it hugged in all the right places and had room for my bust! i did go up a size...however, i normally have to do that anyway for the top to fit.this dress is funky, and i look forward to wearing it with tights and boots in the winter, very comfortable. it has pockets!!!
other You've probably read through the other reviews, so i'll try not to repeat too much:__________pros:- it is lightweight and flows beautifully, flattering every sort of shape and frame.- the leather circles throughout are darling and seem to be fairly secure (some of mine were a bit bent upon receipt).- the color is subtle yet not understated. it just works. not sheer, lining throughout that isn't itchy and some tulle on top of the lining to give it a bounce and fuller shape.- color is more t
other I found this set once while browsing the website. i fell in love with it and kept a photo of the set so i could save up to purchase it. as luck would have it, my mom surprised me with a gift card, so i applied it to my purchase. i'm so happy with the set. it's wonderfully flattering, and makes me feel sexy. i want one in every color!
3 I'm still on the fence with this shirt. i have the grey - it almost looks like a cheetah design up close. i'm 5'3"
other I cannot believe this t-shirt is on sale! the colors and the design are beautiful and soft. the shirt is an average t-shirt weight, and the fit is nice and loose on the body like it is on the models. i am 5'3" with a petite/athletic build and the xs fits comfortably (with some room...washing may make it even more perfect). i cannot wait to wear this with jeans on the weekends or with a grey skirt to work.
other Perfect fit for my size. it elongate my petite frame.
other I really like this shirt overall. i'm 5'other and the petite sizes were sold out so i bought a regular. if you are short like me, beware that the sleeves am be almost comically long. while the shirt is stretchy, the cuffs are not so pushing the sleeves up isn't really an option. also, it had lots of loose, hanging threads straight out of the package. but overall, it's a keeper!
other True to size, nice unique shoulder/neckline fit and blousey/full on the bottom and arms which taper in. for me, i prefer to wear it tucked or partially tucked in to add waist definition. though a vest or belt can also be used. sheer, you will need a cami. lovely flow and colors., the collar,pleats and neck tie add a romantic interest. just beautiful.
other I was shopping for a holiday outfit today at my retailer store, and my sales associate suggested i try on this top. i have lo idea where it was on the store l, yet it's a very pretty top that stands out when you have it on. i took this in a small because it's meant to run shorter. i felt xs would have been too small. i purchased it to wear with jeans or dress pants. pretty detail. blouse shows off my arms and minimizes my waist. i love it!
other I love this little number. the quality is terrific, the weight is perfect, and the cut is superb. i love the way it fits and looks in the arms. i ordered my usual xxsp and it is perfect. i like that it is cool and flowy, without looking like maternity attire. i have the bright turquoise and i am going to order another. i was about to order what looks like a yellow one, but i noticed the color is labeled "chartreuse". can anyone tell me if this is more yellow or green in "real life"?
other I get nervous ordering clothes online but that was my only option for this dress. i love everything about this dress and i love the pockets.
other I really love the feel of the fabric on this dress. when you first take it from the package it resembles a tent, but once you figure out how to scrunch the front and back around the straps, it resembles the photo. the fabric is very soft and the indigo colors are amazing. this dress is perfect over a swimsuit or for casual gatherings. you can even dress it up with a belt. it is somewhat sheer, but does look cute with a cropped jacked over it.
other These pants run large than the true size. it is so comfortable and can be dress up or dressed down.
other This dress is so vibrant in person. i am 5'10" and the length is perfect. having a small waist helps too. certainly worth the $49 i spent on it. watch the sales. several times ill go to pay for an item, and its even cheaper that advertised. the uniqueness that retailer embodies is what i love the most about their clothing. i'm a size 10, ordered a medium
other I got this in white and was surprised to see that it fits me. i am very petite but with a 32d bust and purchased the xxs. this fit me perfectly! the fabric is soft and kind of silky, the straps were not too long, the hem hit just at my hip line. i am buying the other color!
other This is a very cute dress that i did not keep. mainly because i did not like the neckline on me. if it had been different i probably would have kept it. i liked the fabric, the top is a little thin, but i did not think it was sheer. the bottom part is sheer, but there is a lining. it drapes beautifully. it is a little like a maternity dress, but not enough to dissuade me.
other I love this blouse!! the shape is very flattering. the fabric is sheer, perfect for those hot summer days. i especially like the way the sleeves fall, just enough flounce. the buttons are a great detail. i didn't bother undoing them, just threw it over my head. looks great dressed up or down.
other I love this shirt for a throw on and go.  hangs nicely and fits great.  colors are more vibrant in person.  i love mauve, i think they do a great job with their designs!
other Received this blouse to wear for the holidays and was not disappointed. the design of the shirt is to be relaxed and flowing. i usually wear a medium which is what i ordered. the shirt fit fine but i probably could of managed with a small if i did not want it as relaxed. so if you are between sizes, you might want to size down. if i did order a small, the sleeves might of been a tad short since i have longer arms. the shirt is sheer, so you will need a cami underneath. i wore a black one which w
other I bought the orange color and the pattern is absolutely beautiful. the fabric and style is very flattering and comfortable. well worth it. runs true to size (i am usually an xsmall 13other lbs 3other c and the xsmall fit perfect). perfect summer dress: soft fabric and light.
other I love this shirt, i had my eye on it for awhile but wasn't sure what size i'd be, so i went to the store to try. they only had a small which i figured i would be but it was a little large and not as fitted as i would like it across the chest. i got an xs and it was perfect; i am 5'other about 120 lbs and a small c cup and it fits great. i love it!!
other I tried on and bought this shirt in my usual size and it fit long and loose but still had great shape. after hand washing in cold water and air drying, as per instructions on the tag, the shirt shrunk significantly. so much so that my stomach shows if i raise my arms at all. it also lost its shape, and now looks very boxy and is very unflattering. i won't be wearing it and am disappointed i didn't even get to wear it once!
other I ordered this top in my normal size medium, and it was very large. i am 160 lbs, 36b, size 8 top and 1other bottom. it was so pretty, that i took a chance and reordered it in a small. the small on me fits just like the model in the picture. it's pretty lightweight, but is not see through. it is a very wide v-neck, but i am small on top, so it does not bother me. it's such a comfy yet sexy top!
other I can't say enough about this sweater! it light, delicate, soft, vintage chic........i could go on and on! buy it already!!!
other I'm glad i took a chance and ordered this jacket. i love military inspired jackets and this one is very cute.it runs a little big, so i'm glad i ordered a size down. i like that it can be worn open or buttoned. it looks great with jeans and boots but i can wear it to work as well. it's definitely more on the casual side, but still a very versatile piece in my closet. love it.
other Wore this dress recently on a work trip. traveled very well, cut and fabric are super flattering
other I may wear these every day! i am obsessed. i am 5'8 125ibs normally a size 25/26 in jeans. i ordered these in a 26 and they fit like a glove! they do not stretch much at all and keep a really nice vintage fit and feel. i am extremely happy with this purchase. these are a must have staple in anyone's wardrobe.
other I'm in love with these tanks. so in love that i bought four of them (black, grey, blue, and the black motif). they are so flattering on. i love the low scoop neck and the wide straps. the cut is interesting enough to wear the shirt on its own, but also perfect for under a cardigan. i purchased a nearly identical one from retailer (which was made by velvet) several months ago and it was much more pricey. these are a much more affordable option.
other This dress is gorgeous in color and print; i think it can be styled as eclectic or elegant as you'd like. definitely runs big in the shoulder/bodice area, so i sized down.
other The dress is beautiful in pictures, but all the reviews are dead on...it was full of snags when it arrived! 8 snags to be exact. and the fabric was heavier than i expected. sadly, had to return.
other I ordered this and thought it would be cute for work, but it tuns out the sleeves are ridiculously long. i am other foot 10 and do not have short arms. also it is a bit short waisted for me. i do love the floral detail of the button.
other I bought these in the store today. they're a great jean. none of the pairs i saw had as much distressing as the picture. there were no holes, which i'm actually grateful for, i don't like holes in jeans. anyway these had a great fit for me. they fit more like a slim straight jean on my curvier figure and really flatter my backside- they aren't baggy, as pictured on the model. they're a great casual jean which i know will be my new staple! (even better- my husband gave them a big thumbs up!)
other Absolutely love this jacket.initially wanted to buy the melita draped jacket, which looks similar to this one, and tried them both on in store. the latter just didn't drape properly and looked more like a bathrobe on me, but this piece is amazing! it falls nicely and the pockets jut out a bit giving it a unique look. the fabric is fluid and soft and it has a tie waist with another tie in the back of the jacket,middle bottom, which is a bit of an added but subtle flair, the color is a bit more 't
other Very happy with my purchase. fit very nice! already received compliments!
other Cup size is really small for a medium. no way to adjust the back strap. ended up giving it to my daughter. cute but so poorly executed.
other The material is so soft, and lightweight without being sheer. i am 5'other #14other and ordered a size 28 in blue. they have a relaxed fit, and a polished-casual look.
3 I bought this online in my usual size (petite xxs) for in-store pickup. when i tried it on, the kindest word to describe it would be "voluminous"--it was at least other sizes too big on me. i looked like i had taken grandma's tablecloth and constructed a homemade blouse. the blouse comes with an attached cami, which was also way too big for me. the color is not white (as described), but rather an ivory/cream color--definitely not the best shade for my light olive skin. i do think that it looks lovel
other I liked this coat but my family said it looked too much like something hilary clinton would wear. i am 5other and i think it made me look a bit dowdy since it runs a bit big.
other I don't care because i like be it so much; but, make no mistake, it is not black but rather a dark navy. however please don't let this fall negatively on your decision to buy it. it's fabulous!
other I'm normally a size small, but the store only had a large. i tried it on and it still fits great as an oversized button down for a threw-on-my-boyfriends-shirt kind of look. i wear it tied in a knot with leggings.the shirt is so so so soft and high in quality.
other Bought these in 28 had to return for a 27p . love them!! i order the other other colors
other I love this coat! it is exactly what i was looking for. it is unlined (with cute fabric edging on the seams) and a lightweight wool but it is roomy enough for layering and that is what i like about it. also like the length as it can conceal a long tunic sweater without it hanging out the bottom. it is very versatile in that it can be worn with something dressy or jeans and leggings. also like that i can add any fun scarf to dress it up or down. it's a great contemporary shape. i would say this c
other I love these cords! soft and great fit. bought three colors!
other Just love this sweater, have it in both colors. can be dressed up or more casual!
other Love, love this dress! the fit is perfect, the cut is feminine and flirty but not too showy and bare. there is the perfect amount of swing and it's a great length, i can't say enough about it. i think it's worth the price, which i have to admit, i was hesitant about. so comfortable and versatile! i see it being worn quite often!keep dresses like this coming!btw, the neck line is flattering on every body type!for reference, i'm 5'3" and weigh 110 lbs and i purchased a size 2, but i think a
other I couldn't resist the toucan print when i saw this online, and ordered in my normal size s (27/other in pants, 34b bust, 5'7"). the fit is perfect - arm holes are an appropriate size (not huge like some dresses), semi-fitted and flattering, nice length for work, and the tie front is a nice detail to help define the waist. length is about the same as the model shot. i knocked off a star for quality since the fabric is not particularly breathable for summer and the zipper is a little tough in the wais
other Love this hoodie. so soft and goes with everything. highly recommend for comfort and style. great company.
other Yes it is boxy, but by design. because it is a shorter length and sheer it isn't an issue for me even as a petite. it has a bit of an ethereal look on as if it's just floating on your body. what doesn't show well in online pictures are beautiful chartreuse, charcoal & white threads running throughout the design. this adds to the classy look of this top.great to dress up jeans or with a dressy pencil skirt for a night out.
other This a great dress! bright colors, soft material and comfortable! the body of the dress is voluminous, so i found it to be a definite swing dress. i can see why it sold out the first time it was offered!
other Love this blouse. i usually wear a small and had to exchange it for an xs, which fits perfectly. not form fitting but flattering; washes beautifully, too. i highly recommend this blouse.
other Saw this on line and bought right away! perfect romper for summer- color is great and fabric is soft- like all cloth and stone chambray. it fits pretty true to size, maybe a little small when putting on, but i think it will stretch out a little. i didn't want it baggy. fits great through hips and booty looks good! i will wear with flip flops, sandals, or wedge. i also got 15% off which made deal even better!
other I bought this earlier in the summer in size xl. i've gotten such good use out of it. the fit on me matches the model. the details of the crochet lace add such a nice touch. not your typical hoodie. but, just the same comfort. i've washed in cold in my machine & air dried. it hasn't shrunk. one of my favorite purchases. perfect for chilly weather or when you go into a/c areas. would love this in other colors. great piece!
other This top is way more sparkly and festive in person. i plan to pair it with black or charcoal gray pants for a holiday party, but it would also go great with dark jeans. it is super cute, can't wait to wear it.
3 I ordered this top because 1. the online product page states the fabric is cotton. 2. i liked the style with the scarf insets. 3. the colorful embroiderey would be a welcome companion for my many pairs of pilcro chinos.when i opened the package several tiny round beads rolled out. after examining the detailing, i found where the beads were missing.size: i normally wear a small for most retailer brands, but i know nothing about slone rouge. i went with a small since it appears oversized on
other This is a beautiful top. it extended longer than i had hoped and a petite size was not available, so i ended up returning it. but it is beautiful and the tassels on the sides make it truly unique.
other I bought this in both the black motif and the ivory. i got a size other and i would say it is true to size. the fabric is very comfortable and doesn't wrinkle easily. it does have a "flowy" look to it but i didn't find that it had too much fabric. i wouldn't tuck it in though. i find it looks really good with skinny jeans/pants and i love throwing a cardigan over it for cooler days. the details in the double buttons and on the back are really cute and make it more unique. i recommend the shirt.
other The shirt is very soft but it felt very large and unflattering. the back felt bulky and looked awkward. definitely returning.
other Got a ton of compliments.  great tee with beautiful print.
3 I did not realize that this knitted vest had an attached gauzy under-layer. i can see it now in the photo, but i just thought it wasn't part of the actual vest. when the vest arrived i realized sadly that this flowing under-layer was part of the design. i don't know why because the yarn and vest are lovely without it. in my opinion, the under-layer takes away from the beautiful vest. i guess i could have spent some time and removed it, but at that price i just sent it back. too bad because the m
other I was so so excited to get this sweater in the mail. unfortunately, the sweater is lined with the same material (very soft and warm btw) as the polka dots, which sheds like crazy. i wore a white tshirt under this for the first time, and my shirt was covered in black fuzz by the end of the day. so much so that i was gathering balls of it to be thrown away. very disappointed. a lint roller can't even clean up the tshirt.in terms of sizing, this fits tts, i normally wear a l or xl, got this in an
3 I love this dress! the print and the fabric make it a fun, uncomplicated outfit choice that can be dressed up or down very easily. that being said, there are two issues i wish i had known about, although i probably would have purchased anyway. 1) it has pockets -yay!!! but also, the pockets create a bulge where they hit my hips and it's not a flattering spot on me to have an extra bulge. 2) i washed before wearing because it was super wrinkled and me and the iron aren't friends anymore. so i thr
other Love this dress. the fringe makes it so special! it's a little shorter than i anticpated - it hits me right about where it shows on the model and i am other 2". i love the length. can't wait to wear this.
other I was on the lookout for a denim jacket when i found this beauty on line. i fell in love immediately and didn't think twice about paying full price. i wear it with moss green chinos and it looks really good. the little dots in the jacket are actually a pale green, which gives it extra character. very well made. i was a bit skeptical about the hook and eye fastenings, but they are very secure. i ordered my usual xl and found it roomy enough in the bust and arms. i would definitely call it tru
other I feel like an indian princess in this dress! it isn't very forgiving, make sure you don't mind showing some skin - but there's some subtle rouching right at the spot where most of us wish we could hide at all times. great colors; boyfriend loves it.
other I thought the dress was ok, but was surprised by the cut away triangles of material right under bra band on the sides of dress. i will send back, also a bit too high waisted for me. other than that, the dress is as it appears.
other This dress has a much more flattering fit than appears! it has curves and fits tts. the fabric is fairly heavy, nice quality polyester and will be just the right weight for a nocal wedding. the back straps nicely cover foundations so even though it's open you don't need special undergarments. the color in the pic is spot on. don't be deceived by the "turquoise" moniker.
other Purchased these jeans in a 27 and i am usually a 28 in skinny jeans. i got the 26's on but they were snug. these jeans are so comfy and sit higher on the waist. great jeans!
other Noticed all the other star reviews online for the latest pilcro stets- so due to the past other years of dissapointment of what was once a great pair of jeans....i was hopeful that retailerpologist listened and went back to the original pilcro stet formula- thick denim, just the right amount of give and a flattering 10 inch rise. walked right in and found them- and i knew right when i touched them- they were still the thin denim that's nowhere near the quality they once were. consumers pay attention and t
other I bought the blue & black, they are great basics. got the small. i am normally a extra small in retailer.
other The fabric is a little stiff, the back looks unusually long compared to the front, and it fits tight across the chest. and i'm not busty so that's not a factor.
3 This dress is only suitable for a beach cover-up: it is completely sheer. expensive, even on sale, for something with such a limited wearability. i returned it.
other A very cute and comfy top that's lightweight and falls nicely... but, it does snag very easily. so far, i've worn this top once and found small snags in multiple areas. the snags might blend into the fabric texture if they did not create dark spots. the yarn/thread is a mixture of a celadon tone and black, which concentrates the black when snagged.
other This is a dress worth paying full price for, based on the good construction and lacework. i got it for an office event, and although it is low-backed, the high neckline makes up for that! no jewelry necessary with the high collar. i am 5'10 and 135lbs, built like a column, so i got the 6. definitely not for full-figured women, unless you want it long. very cool orange lining and buttons on the back vent.
other This sweater is thick and does cover the bra well. i did not find it to be well made. the ribbing seemed to be attached loosely in places. i am a size large with a b cup and a bit thicker through the middle to my middle age dismay. putting this sweater on in coral made me feel like a giant peach. for those with larger breasts it is likely more flattering.
other I am a short frame with broad shoulders and a large chest which means peplum tops typically look horribly unflattering on my frame. not this top! the cut is very flattering due to the lower peplum. not too much fabric to add to the waistline, truly a perfect fit. if this top came in any other colors, i would buy them all.
3 Bought this in the store and fell in love with it. very soft and flattering to wear. however, after wearing it one day it is already starting to pill. this truly is a beautiful sweater, but i fear it will not be beautiful for long. i am willing to take the chance as i got it on sale.
3 This sweater dress color is great and texture is nice however ran huge. read the other reviews before ordering and ordered down to a medium and was just to boxy and could not get it to hang well. unfortunately it went back.
other I bought this for our daughter. i tried it on when it arrived and the material is fabulous and feels soooo good against the skin. the purple is a stunning color - very subdued and classy. if she does not like it on christmas after gifts are opened, guess who is going to keep it for herself! if she loves it as much as i think she will, then i'll just have to get one for myself. the pleats in the back are very flattering. best of all is the fabric. it is luxurious. thank you retailer for yet another
other This is such a cute jumper! i bought it to wear to a beach wedding. i took a chance trying on a medium (i'm a true large) and was pleasantly surprised by how well it fit! very excited to add this to my spring/summer repertoire!
other Super cute, well made, great embroidery. waist runs big.
other Cute top and perfect for those hot summer days as fabric is light, but not sheer.
other These run tiny. i wear a 25/26 in pants and took a medium in this bottom and i'm still not completely comfortable with the fit. love the floral print, but with a bottom this small you don't really see much of the flowers so on mine at least it's just some splashes of different dark colors.
other This is a deliciously soft and cozy cashmere sweater. the cashmere is thick and knitted with a ribbed brioche stitch. the sweater is true to size, though a bit boxy, so i did size down for a slightly more fitted and flattering look. the sweater is a little on the short side, but i'm petite, so i thought the regular xxs was perfect. the stitch details are lovely and it it so soft i want to wear it every day. it did start to pill after one wear, but this is the nature of cashmere. i'm very pleased
other Love the feminine take on flannel and how it fits like a tailored shirt. i am a bit long waisted and the side slit reveals a little too much when i lift my arms. if the shirt was just a little longer it would be perfect.
other Weather changes during a day to extremes in nela. lightweight cardigan for when little is needed that's pretty and practical, if you take a close look at photo you will see the weave is open, so could snag. nothing hidden. it is what it is-pretty, lacy, feminine.
other This romper is one of my favorite purchases. the material is great, the fit is very forgiving, and it is very comfortable. it is easily dressed up or down. i purchased a size smaller than i usually wear and it fits well.
other I wanted these culottes to work so much! the fabric is gorgeous, but the size i ordered didn't fit. i'm normally a size 28 in pants, and i ordered a size 8. it was way too tight and made me look like i had a pooch in the zipper area. not what i wanted it to be. had to return them unfortunately.
other I was so excited to order this dress; however, once it arrived, i realized that the fit doesn't work for me. i carry my weight in my stomach and backside, and the dress clung to my trouble areas.
other I ordered a medium, as i like my shirts a bit loose. it is a beautiful shirt, and looks great in person. however, this shirt is cut more wide and short than it is long and lean. exchanged for a small!
other Wish they had more colors in these pants. the dark grey is very nice, but i'd definitely take another color if offered. very cute pants. a fantastic deal at the sale price. but size down! they run a full size too big.
other This is a gorgeous flowy top. i paired it with a pair of army green pants and have received a ton of compliments. you can dress this top up for a night out or for work, or style it for a fun evening out. you will be very pleased with this top.
other So soft and comfortable and flattering on! run small. i'm a 25/0 pant and a small in these is as small as i'd want to go! otherwise, excellent.
other Very soft, comfortable piece that can be worn casually with jeans and a tee or over a blouse or sheath dress for work. i like the 3/other length sleeves and pockets
other Bought this for my daughter. it's adorable on her. we're going to take it in at the waist so it doesn't look so sack-like; then it'll be perfect!
other This is a fabulous style top! highly recommend this top. comfortable material. retailer is consistently tried and true to a classy style!
other There may be no inner lining, but it is a gorgeous bra! and so comfortable! the straps and well make and sturdy and the detailing is stunning. it is absolutely true to size. 34c fit like a glove. a winner!
other I wore these pants for the first time yesterday to two parties. before anyone asked for my name, they complimented me on the pants. my husband loved it, my friends loved it, and people i didn't know loved it. it's worth every penny i paid for it. i bought these pant to bring on my trip to italy later this summer.
other Lovely sweater! it's a new staple in my wardrobe. love the fit and styling, but what drew me in at first sight were the colors. it's warm and cuddly.
other I love joggers, best style to come along in awhile. i think these are well made and i like the fabric. i just wish the leg were cut a bit slimmer but that's just a matter of preference. i definitely like them and will keep and wear.
other I am long waisted and 5' 120 lbs. 34c. that being said, i purchased a size s regular and it fit perfectly. a petite would have been far too short. so i would recommend a regular size if you're a petite. also i have a big chest and this was very flattering. because of my chest size i usually do best with a v neck, but this classic peter pan collar looks great! i purchased the black. i agree with one of the reviewers who said that the nude color looked like a mess of a weave. the black and white o
other Absolutely love everything about this sweater. i was hesitant to buy because it's so oversized and i was worried it would overwhelm my small frame. but the xs fits great, i love the large knit look and the bell sleeves. pairing with dark denim skinny jeans helped balance out the sweaters oversized shape. wore it work and then to a party and received compliments on it all day.
other I do not even know where to begin with this product. i ordered a small (i go between small and medium) and felt that would be a good fit. after trying on the shirt, i would have opted for the xxxxxxxxs or whatever the smallest size is. this shirt is very boxy. i know its supposed to have a 'flow' to it, but this shirt is too much. it needs to be taken in. or have a belt wrapped around it. i tried the belt look but it did not look flattering. i found this color to be very blah. overall, i am slig
other I found this in my local atl store that carries petites before seeing it on-line. the materials is lovely and silky with a full lining. the top lace detailing is a nice touch and will make the dress stand out under jackets or sweaters for cool weather. this is great with any shoe type. very versatile year round piece alone or under layers. should be good for all body types.
other This is probably my new favorite bathing suit. the colors are a tad different than in the picture, but still really pretty
other I'm 5'other and 130lbs and i was swimming in the small. the arms are very boxy, the sleeves too long, and and it just wasn't a flattering fit at all. the color and design on the front are both nice. the sweater is made in china and very, very itchy. i own wool sweaters and wear them with layers, but there was no way this was going to be comfortable. very disappointed, especially given the price, but perhaps that's why there are so many left at the end of the season and on sale. this one is going bac
other I loved them on when i got them, but they literally frayed apart on my body as i wore them, and i had them on no more than other times. it was not a fit issue or a seam issue; they literally just frayed apart in two areas.  while flattering and incredibly comfortable, the fabric was not at all durable...they are not your typical  denim,  they almost kind of a knit feel them.
other It is a beautiful sweater, but it is cropped and boxy.
other I'm a power-walker. i bought this tank in 3 colors and rotate through them. they're great for working out with a nice sports bra underneath. i also wear them with leggings. so cute! love the colors, the fit. yes, they're thin. i don't think they'll last for years and years, but with the sale price they are such a great deal.
other This blouse is great to wear almost anytime! it can easily be dressed up or down depending on the occasion and the accessories. it has a bit more volume around the waist then the picture shows - but that could be because i'm bit more "well endowed" than the model. i'm 5'0 and size m/8. this shape looks great on my curves without making me look chunky or stout. the image makes the color look black, but in person the color can pass for a really dark blue in some light. the textile of the fabric is
other I bought 3 shirts in gold, black and red. they arrived larger than expected. after the first wash and air dry they shrunk. i would have been thrilled but they shrunk to be shorter while staying too wide. also my black shirt faded a lot with one wash.
other This is a pretty sweater that is great for transitioning to fall. wear it sleeveless on throw a leather jacket over it for cooler nights. fights true to size. the gray is a very pretty color. great addition to my wardrobe!
other Grabbed this off the sales rack-not expecting much-but it is a great sweater! like other reviewers mentioned-roomy but still form fitting. i wear it to work with black pants and boots and it looks great. cozy, warm, very cute. i usually wear a small but got an xs in this. a much better sweater than how it appears in the online pics.
3 I loved this dress, i usually wear a petite but went with regular based on the reviews. i workout and it was snug on my arms.. fabric felt great, loved the fringe.. just a but snug in the arms for me.
other I got this number in the turquoise and i hadn't expected the skirt to be ribbed! are they all like that? retailer was out of the petites, so i sized down in a regular instead -- yeah, that didn't work. i definitely needed the petite version and perhaps should have even sized up. the bust was scandelously tight. in the end the dress wasn't flattering on my figure the way this style usually is on me -- the proportions were off somehow. it's just not one of those dresses that curvy petite girls shoul
other Found this lovely dress in store and wanted to try it on. fits true to size everywhere except the bust. i am a size 2-other with a 34dd bust. i can normally fit most retailer dresses no problem though. this one was very very very tight just in the bust and squished my chest to be a very unflattering shape.i am 5'other and the length was perfect just above the knee, for a youthful but work appropriate length.i am a relatively fit but hourglass curvy lady, but certainly not a 'perfect' beach body and
other This little pantie is fun and playful. its a deep maroon color with small shimmering lace details. the back is sheer but the front is more filled in and opaque. the ribbons on the sides can actually be untied which is a big plus for me. i'm a small lass, but i have a big bum so i got a medium and it fits perfectly.
other I got a small (5'9, 135lbs) and it fits great! it is super comfortable and also looks really good on.
other This is a great dress if you don't want to leave the house or you want the world to see your nipples.
other This is a great dress for summer and very flattering!  i am 5'other and could have pulled off the regular length but chose to go with the petite so that i could wear flats.
other Beware ladies! these are the first pair of cartonnier pants i've tried that actually run large! i have several other pair of cartonnier crops that are sized way up to a 10 (my normal size is 6 or 8). to my surprise, my normal size 6 in these for perfectly!! the fabric is way different than the printed crops. i got the bright red, and fabric is stretchy! great fit and great weight for summer!
other Extremely well made tank top. great for work or a night out.
3 The skirt is very pretty, but it's not as dark as the street pictures which i like those colors better. it's also super long. it will have to be hemmed if i decide to keep it. for reference, i'm 5'7" and it was sweeping the floor (size medium). given the price, i'm not certain i will keep it. i'll try it on a few times, then decide.
3 This top fit nicely and was tts, but the pattern was different than i expected. i thought it would be more of a desert scene and it turns out there are cowboys on it and it just didn't fit my style. if there were cowgirls on it i would have kept it.
other This top is gorgeous. the colors are lovely, design and quality are impeccable, and it is versatile. this top just happened to catchc my eye and i am so happy with my purchase. it fits tts. i love it!!
other I don't normally spend so much on t shirts but this one is worth it. really well made and quite unique. i reckon i'll get a lot of use out of it,
other Love this vest. fits very similar to the pilcro denim jacket. the fabric is softer, and not too heavy. the wash on mine is pretty close to the one in the picture, maybe half a shade darker. can see myself wearing this with summer maxi dresses, skirts, and pants, a very versatile piece that will go into fall. i usually take a 0/other and the xs fit perfectly.
other Wore it to an interview. the color is fantastic. it's beautiful and artsy. highly recommend!
3 I so wanted this blouse to work. the lacework is beautiful, and it is a substantial and well made top. the neck fits well, which is not a given for this style top, and i really like the 3/other length sleeves. but the top billows out like a tent on me in all directions, and it was an awkward length on me (not quite hip length, not quite tunic). wish this were cut a little straighter and longer. i'm 5'4", 120 lbs and tried a size s.
other I bought this dress for a trip to the caribbean and really enjoyed wearing it.i was worried it might look like a "sack" but i think it is both slimming and flattering. i love the interesting neckline and rolled up sleeves!! a winner.
other I bought this on sale and absolutely love it. i bought the xs, i'm 5'10, 14other lbs and a b/c cup and it fit well. i am considering sewing in cups, since i don't like using stick-on bras as much and none of my other bras work with the back. that really is my only complaint about the dress, everything else is great!
other I was able to get this on sale. when it arrived, it was missing half of the rhinestones. i am very surprised that this top would be sent out this way. it also was missing the little bag with extra stones. i'm reaching out and wondering if anyone else has experienced this and is there a store that sells rhinestones like the one on the blouse? any help from anyone would be appreciated. i hate to part with this, but where was quality control?
other I have had this dress for a few months now and find it is super comfortable for the hot weather and can go dressy or casual with the right accessories. it does run large in xxs; the xxs petite fit a little better by was way too short for me. even better is that you can wash on the super gentle cycle and lay flat to dry. yes it says dry clean only, but its is made of cupro and you should be able to wash that material. i have washed mine several times and it has never shrunk or lost shape. the she
3 Agree with other reviewers: this runs narrow in the skirt. the top is also quite low-cut, and it's already lined so i can't see wearing a cami or slip. i like the black-and-white print and the shape, and might have tried a size larger in the store. finally, it's an awkward, unflattering length. i'm 5'4" and it hit below my knee.
other This is one of my favorite tops! i have it in two colors. it's almost like a swing look, yet it still feels like it gives me a shape to my body. very easily paired with a skinny jean. i paid full price for th two, but now i'm sure i'll buy the third on sale!
3 I fell in love with these online. i thought they would be such a nice piece of statement denim. unfortunately they did not work for me. i am 5'2" and the waist of these paints was four inches away from my breasts. it didn't look bad from the back but from the front it was comical. the denim itself is nice and heavy but, like the previous reviewer stated, not a dark wash. the pair i received was a medium whiskered wash. if i was taller these would have been a yes, despite the wash discrepancy.
other This dress has a flattering and fitted cut which perfectly compliments the unique eyelet fabric. it is at once elegant yet casual, perfect for the office or better yet, afternoon tea in a far flung british colony of yesteryear. which brings me to the buttons - putting on this dress makes one wish one had a ladies maid, but the effort is well worth it for this stunner of a dress. as others have said, it runs small and tight in the chest and is not for the well endowed. i am a petite 5'2" and fit
3 The positive: light-weight fabric, interesting drapethe negative: i'm tall and would have preferred if it was longer. the big drawback is the ridiculous buttons--three fell off the first time i wore it...and it fits loosely! they're held on by a single loop...ugh.
other I ordered this dress online and did not realize it had beaded details on the bodice... gorgeous dress - perfect for festival season.
other I bought yellow one, and i'm very happy with this purchase. the flower print is beautiful, and the material is light, but not too thin. i love wearing this top with a pair of blue denim or a pair of white bottom.i'm pretty short in height and size 36c. i bought a m in regular size because i like my tops roomy, and it fits really nice, i just tie a small knot on the bottom of this top or tuck the shirt in a little bit, it works perfect.
other I felt like i was taking a risk by ordering these without trying them on, but i am so happy i did. they are soft and solid without being thick or stiff. incredibly comfortable. i have a larger hip and booty and these fit great. no grabbing at all and without making the top too big or loose.
other I do not know if this item is worth the full price but i love it. very soft, good length, and comfortable to wear. the stripes are a perfect width so as not to be overpowering. the fabric design is unique and i think the weave added to the cost of production. for many it may not be worth the cost but i am glad i purchased this top. it is not a sheer fabric. try it on if you see it in the store.
other This is a love at first sight item! bought that home after seeing it on the model. very soft and lovely! especially love the tie back! i wore it with a t shirt underneath. i am 5'4" and size small. i bought xs and still a bit long. wish they have petite at the store.
3 This runs huge, not large, huge; and hung in quite a baggy way. bought a medium ( 5'10, 150 lbs) and i could have gotten an x-tra small. maybe if there were free shipping i would have reordered, but now its just too much of a hassle
other I was excited to get these pants & at a great price! i am 5'9 & these pants were plenty long enough for me. they also have a nice light textured design that's hard to notice in pictures. the only problem was they are a side zip pant which i didn't know when ordering. i don't love the zip on the side for my shape it. so i'm still wondering if i'll keep them. other than that nice pant!
3 I wanted to love these, but the zipper is extremely short and they were not flattering on my thicker thighs and large behind. the fabric is so soft, however and the color is great. would work on a less curvy woman!
other I love this shirt. i bought the ivory color. it's incredibly comfortable and an easy style.
other It's lightweight, soft, & slinky, unike the average t-shirt. the slinkiness makes it skim the body nicely.
3 Purchased because i wanted a deep red sweater, and this one was the perfect color. unfortunately i am on the curvier side, with 34g chest, 155lbs 5' 5", and the med was too big, (i usually wear m or l at retailer.) also the fit ended up being boxy on my body type.
other I purchased this jacket on pure impulse. to be quite honest it reminds me of a coat my dad used to wear, and i was halfway on the way to retailer when i decided to try it on. my goodness it's perfect. it's slightly oversized, delightfully 70's and makes everything look good skirts, pants, dresses etc. buy it, especially off the 70's have a special place in your heart.
other I love this skirt! i know others have thought it frumpy, maybe it's because i'm so long waisted but this skirt is perfect for me! not too long not too short but just right! the fabric print is beautiful a mix of muted and bright colors. the fabric quality is nice but nothing overly outstanding. still i'm glad i ordered it before it was gone!
other So happy i purchased this - it's a gorgeous piece, and perfect for fall and winter. the colors are soft and beautiful, and i feel like this will pair well with a lot of shirts in my closet.
other This blouse is easily one of the nicest i have bought in recent times. the quality is excellent, the design demonstrates that design and nature are extremely compatible. i have worn this blouse with jeans and in a more formal situation and with a little more jewelry, the blouse fits in perfectly anywhere. i highly recommend it.
other This is a find! i am always on the hunt for a unusual lbd so when i found this on a "found and collected rack" i went for it. for starters, i am other foot almost 6 inches, and it the length ends just about the same place on this model. i usually wear a size other but when i tried on the size available in the store (oo), i felt i only needed a bit higher sizing bc i am small in the chest. i am barely a size 3other a and probably a 30d at best, and i barely can squeeze my chest into this dress at this size!
other This poncho is perfect! the slits on the side may seem intimidating at first, but wear a flowy tank under neath it for a nice added detail. it's easy to wear over a fitted dress as well, or a high-waisted full skirt.i have red hair and the gold looks amazing with that hair color. but the grey and creme are neutral and go well with a lot of options.
3 Loved the idea of this but content felt too thin and sheer.
other I love this top! the colors are beautiful & look incredible with jeans as well as so many of the different color pilcro pants in my closet. it's the perfect between-season item.since i don't like garments that have a "boxy" fit, i was concerned that this top wouldn't work for me after reading some of the other reviews. but it looks great & feels comfy.
other My favorite features of this sweater are the flattering neckline and the bracelet length sleeves. it's a heavy-weight cotton with a beautiful line. my only complaint is that it seems to pick up lint and things very easily and needed a lint roller even straight out of the delivery box. still, a small issue for an easy to wear sweater that looks great with jeans and boots as well as leggings. a new favorite!
other I recently purchased this blouse in black. i love the soft yet crepe like fabric and the small bit of negative space trim just above the bust line gives it an air of elegance. comfortable and breathable, i see this becoming a "how did i live without this" staple.
other I just received my dress yesterday and it is gorgeous!!! i actually ordered other sizes, 00p and 0p, depending on some cuts i'm between those other sizes, i am 5'other 9other lbs but with holidays eating i have gained other pounds so far, so the 00p was bit too tight all way from hips to bust area, i was able to zip it up but was a bit painful to keep breathing and got some weird wrinkles on the back between waist line and derriã©re.the dress is a beautiful cocktail of sexy curvy silhouette with the baroque flavor
3 Pretty top online - okay in person. runs small, especially on bottom hemline. thought it would have a swing to it. it does not. more sheer in person than i thought it would be. that wouldn't stop me from keeping it though. it was the way it laid on my chest that was unflattering. looked like i was wearing a bib. i don't have a large chest, just weird look on me. unfortunate, because it is an adorable print. top made for thinner or a petite lady.
other This dress fits wonderfully. i can wear it causally or dress it up if i want to. great deal as well.
other This top really is lovely. i had high hopes of it looking smashing with black jeans. i wash everything before i wear it. though this garment says it needs to be dry cleaned, there was nothing so delicate about the fabric that it had to be dry cleaned. so i hand washed it with delicate soap. when the lighter colors came into contact with the black, the black immediately stained the light color. i tried putting some stain remover on the black stains, rinsed and hung it above my bath tub. it is cur
other Really cute romper that can be dressed up or down. super comfortable and flattering. i ordered the xs and it fit perfect.
other These jeans hug in all the right places. the high waist accentuates my body and makes my legs look a mile long! the jeans will need a trip to the tailor to be hemmed, pooling even with my highest heels.
3 I love love love the soft fabric and the cozy cowl. however mine not only had a giant hole, it seemed like the yarn started pilling as soon as i touched it. love the idea, but not practical, even without a hole =)
other I feel in love when i tried it on! i'm 5'other an usually have to hem long dresses - but this on fits perfectly. it's full length on me -it's shorter on the model but i think it looks better full length. and it's a gorgeous burgundy. soft and comfortable. can't wait to wear it!
other These are great pants. i was nervous because when i saw them at the store they looked pretty linty but after wearing them a number of times they are not bad. i have to run a lint roller over them occasionally but not more than other black pants. i wear these to work and they are very comfortable. kind of stretchy, but very flattering. the higher rise than the other stevies makes them work really well for work-allows them to look less "jean" like. i highly recommend these-can't believe they aren'
other Just received yesterday & i love this skirt! it's crazy soft, very flow-y and the higher slits on each side let it be more sexy than hippie-looking which i appreciate. great to pair with a funky pair of tights underneath. sits nicely on your body - hugs your curves.only annoyance is it's a bit awkward to walk in as the material moves around your legs & gets caught a bit. you definitely have to be conscious of it as you walk.i bought a m in gray which fit perfectly (i'm 5'9" & usually a 6). t
other This dress is exactly what i was looking for for fall events. can be dressed up or down, flowy, suede-like fabric. i normally wear a small in most retailer pieces and even though i am pregnant in my first trimester i bought a small in this since it is stretchy and will fit me at different stages.
3 Very pretty dress and nicely made (the embroidery is quite lovely and double lining, as mentioned by the other reviewers, is awesome), but not a good shape for me and my hourglass figure. like a lot of swing dresses, it has no structure, and it's not a good look on someone a little busty, as i am. in all honesty, i thought the sack-like shape of the dress made me look 20 lbs heavier than i am. i am a medium, size 6-8, and took the 8 based on the other reviews. i probably could have sized down to
other This is a fantastic top to wear with the paige high wasted flair jeans. love it
other Very cute top. the sleeves were more quarter length on me. looks great with jeans
other This dress is too short for me to wear as a dress, at 5'7" and over 40. however is is great with leggings and boots.it drapes nicely not over sized like many dresses this style. the color is more earthy than pictured. it's actually nicer in person than online. and it has a wonderful texture to it. i was drawn to it when i walked in the store they had it on display under s short cropped jacket and boots.
other Had to return for a larger size. like the design, though. quality wasn't as expected but since i purchased on sale, i decided not to return the top but exchange for a larger size which i hope is still available.
other These are the perfect combination of comfort and beauty. i highly recommend.
other I bought this stylish and cozy sweater in ivory. i find that cable knit sweaters tend to add bulk, but this sweater creates a long, lean look. it looks great with leggings and skinny jeans, and the buttons on the cowl are a fun detail. every time i wear this, i get compliments on it.
other Runs large under arms i am typically a size medium but bought size small.
3 I was so excited to get this top! i love the bow at the neck and the frill sleeves, so current. unfortunately, it was difficult for me to pull it over my head! the neck opening is too small, and there are no buttons. i have a pretty small head and very fine straight hair, so i can imagine that others will have a similar issue getting it on!i am keeping it because i love the style, but will need to alter the neck myself. the rest of the top fits just a bit loose.i got the x-small and am a 3
other I know this is labeled under activewear, but the fabric is a dream, it's incredibly flattering and could absolutely be worn in any outfit! i just bought the moss and may end up getting the other colors too. i generally am a l or xl, and the large fit well. it's alined and has a bit of stretch to it. it's so comfortable! highly recommend!
other Super itchy! had to return.
other I love this top. it was everything i hoped it would be. it is lined so it is not see through in the chest/back; sleeves are sheer. soft. gorgeous color. love the layers. runs large so definitely size down. i am usually a m and ordered the s. i'm 5'8" curvy 32dd
other This is my new favorite shirt!! you can dress it up or down. so comfy and totally flattering :)
other I love this dress! it is an easy throw on and go dress. the fabric is very soft and the cut is faltering. fit is true to size.
other Would be flattering on someone who is slim with all the right curves. i'm average size and a mother of 3. the medium was not a true medium. the fabric was amazing. the arm holes were too open/low cut for my taste. i'm 5'7" and 140. this landed mid calf. not my preference. retailer accepted the return with a hassel free refund all under other weeks from receiving it.
other The dress is well-structured and refined enough to wear with a cardigan to work on casual fridays but fun enough to wear on its own to a summer festival. because of the length, i would suggest wearing with heels, as it hits below the knee. i would suggest a size down, especially if you are smaller-busted.
other Love the pattern on this lightweight cardigan and it is super flattering. i tried ordering the xs/s first because the next size up just sounded too big, but i ultimately had to order up for more room in shoulders and length in arms, though. i'm hoping the m/l fits without too much spare fabric because it really is a great piece.
3 I tried this on in my usual xs (5'5", 128lbs) and it fit like a dream. i was instantly in love. until i looked from the side and realized it was cut up way too short. i have a longer torso and shorter legs and this came up past my finger tips if i stood with my arms down. no way could i wear this as a dress. as a tunic definitely though, but i was really hoping to find a nice, versatile fall dress. it was a let down but i still may consider purchasing it because the material was so soft and it f
other This skirt is gorgeous. i love the dots, the heavy fabric, the slight metallic in the weave. it also has two exposed zippers, one on either side of the waist, which gives it an edgy vibe. a perfect counter balance to the 50s circle skirt cuteness. however, not knowing my size in tracy reese, i ordered my usual retailer size 4. i cannot even zip it. i measured it and the size other has a 2other inch waist. there is about an inch of give in the band, but the elastic is so heavy it would not be flattering to
other I had purchased other sanctuary black petite leggings in the store and found these on -line. they are very flattering and well-made. runs a little small, i am 5'0 and 97 lbs; small fit more loosely which i prefer so i can wear them to work. thanks retailer for carrying great petite selection!
other I love this top. lovely, light, airy material, though i don't think i'll wear a cami under it. i'm usually a small petite so i ordered this in an extra small. i love the way it fits.
3 I'm usually a 6 in dresses and the 6 here fit okay. loose but still flattering a little long for a sundress. i was unhappy with it looking a little frumpy and being so loose under the arms all my bras showed . i took it back to the store and after reading the reviews here decided to try the smaller sizes...well multiple dresses later i ended up buying a size other petite!!! and i'm 5'9". the other reg and petite still had the loose gathering look to the top but both fit much better under the arms so tha
other I bought this dress in both colors. it has an easy fit, is very comfortable and works well for a day dress, running errands, play time, and general casual. i am small framed and somewhat slender. i ordered the xs. the fit is easy loose, the fabric just right for the type of dress, like a favorite summer sweatshirt! i wish it came in other colors
other Omg so i never pay full price for a t-shirt because it's just a t-shirt but there are exceptions for every rule. i can't believe i am saying this but this shirt was worth it! it is true to size (a relaxed fit) so if you are in between sizes, you could comfortably size down. the colors are just so darling. love this. not disappointed.
other I would describe as an upgraded t-shirt. a perfect flowy top that you can dress up or down. comfortable and soft material.
other This caught my eye straight away and it hasn't disappointed on either. really unique and i imagine it will suit many different occasions. high quality and slimming vertical stripes too.
other I only say that this sleep top runs small because it shrinks a whole size after you wash it. i'd recommend that you order up a size for that reason. otherwise it is cute. i am ordering the shorts to go with it.
other I'm petite, and i knew buying this that it would be a big sweater - that is the look that is portrayed on the model. the sweater is scratchy, the neck was so big and bulky i had trouble making it lay right. it looks great on the model here, but not on me. going back. so bummed. the color gray is true to what is shown and it has little "holes" or openings across the shoulders. so there is a tiny bit of detail. overall, not a great sweater.
other Love this t-shirt....i will be wearing this until it wears out. very soft; great fit; and very comfortable....
other I purchased this dress in white and am quite happy with the fit and design. not too fancy but definitely not casual either. easy to dress up or down and can be worn for various occasions. the fit is great, but i do wish it was not so lose around the belly (it truly is fine though). has more of the hanging feel than the fitted feel. very comfortable for an evening out.
other I really love this dress, just not on me! i am very curvy, with a rounder stomach. i normally wear a 10 (5'8, 160lbs), and the 10 fit, but it is so fitted that i didn't like how it showed everything. if i had a flatter stomach, i would have kept it, but it just doesn't work on my body style unless i wanted to constantly be pulling it down (it was riding up a bit). the fabric is great, the color and pattern are so lovely i almost ignored my instinct and kept it anyway (my boyfriend, who is picky,
other This is not only comfortable but incredibly flattering. being 6'0" it's also long enough for me.
other I loved this shirt when it first arrived and i couldn't wait to wear it. after one day of wear, i went to hang the shirt back up and it was ripping on both sides of the middle back seem. this shirt was not tight on me at all. very disappointed.
other I am truly heartbroken that this dress is sold out in my size -- it's is incredibly flattering, glamorous, and interesting. and it has sleeves! this is such a hard combo to find and i wish more than anything i can find my size to wear to a wedding. retailer, please please make more dresses like this one that flatter all figures and are classics.
other The photos don't do the top justice. the split back is very unique and adorable. i typically take a size 8 in tops, but ordered a 1other since a reviewer suggested it was narrow in the shoulders. the 1other shoulder fit perfectly, but the body is way too big -- i was swimming it in. i like it enough that i'm going to visit the tailor to take in the body. with the sale price, it is worth tailoring.
other I'm not sure why it's considered a "blue motif," i think it's more on the black and cream side. other than that this is a great silk top for warmer weather, it's lightweight and airy and you'll probably want to wear a nude bra underneath. looks great with jeans and heels for a fun night out as well as trousers for work. i'm 5'7" and almost 130 lbs with a 34a bust and a small fit great.
other I purchased these bottoms with the matching peplum top in romantic floral. i also purchased the higher waisted bottoms just in case. i returned the higher bottoms and that's saying a lot. i have two sons and now struggle with fit in regard to two piece bathing suits. the higher bottoms just didn't fit right and i didn't need the extra coverage because these fit so well and the peplum gives extra coverage, though not really necessary. the others cut in a bit in the seat and hips and these
other I am not sure who would look good in this dress. it is extremely oversized with tons of fabric that will not flatter anyone!
other I love this dress, i love the style, i love the pattern, i love the feel of the fabric. there's a slight puffiness to the shoulders that surprised and delighted me. however, i think it runs a little large, particularly because it's not fitted at all - that tie around the waist is the only defining feature, and it's a great one: this dress (and your figure) needs it. i am 13other pounds, 5'5", and i normally wear a 6. perhaps i should've known to try a small, but i went with my usual size in dresses
other I ordered the ivory in size xl. it fit a little on the small side. the knit was good quality as was the lace. unfortunately, the mock neck was stiff and uncomfortable. the sleeves were a little too long for me as well so i returned it. but, it's such a unique style and good quality.
3 Such a cute dress but it runs large. i'm 5'4" 130 lbs and am typically a size other can wear a size other in certain clothes. i tried on the xs and it was still too big. i would of bought it in an xxs but they are sold out. really a comfy laid back dress that would be comfortable in summer. if they get more xxs i'll buy it.
other This is a beautiful piece that can be paired with multiple ways.. the color is rich and classy
other Great, stylish, swinging dress. softly draped fabric, so comfy to wear....very slimming and figure flattering.
other I fell in love with this jumpsuit at first sight. the color is stunning and very striking. i found it to run a bit large, so would suggest sizing down for optimal fit, but all in all a great piece for summer that will transition nicely into early fall.
other I ordered this jacket to complement the larkin dress by moulinette soeurs, which i planned to wear to a funeral. the pair together were perfect. the jacket added just the right touch in fashion and practical warmth on a sunny but chilly february morning in alexandria, va. i ordered my usual size and it fit perfectly, if not a tad bit large. but then i'm not very tall so occasionally items have more material than i need. but i never worry about that since it doesn't usually affect the lines of th
3 Looks so cute in the picture, but just didn't really look that flattering on - plus the sleeves were too tight and too long for my short arms so going back....
other I really wanted to love this, but it was just too voluminous to be flattering. i am typically a size 10 or 1other in dresses and jumpsuits, and the medium was billowing around me. also,the elastic waist hit me low and bunched in an unflattering way. it had to go back.
other I purchased this skirt at retailer store in texas. i fell in love since i saw it. the fabric is nice and the colors are pretty and cheerful for this spring/summer !! and it has pockets on the sides! don't we love pockets? very practical and lightweight
3 Great colors and not too voluminous. lined whig will be great for fall but the downsides are the huge elastic waist bc it'll require a belt or something over it (looks v casual alone) and even with a perfect fit it gives a bit of muffin just bc it's a huge piece of elastic. i've literally tried this on on two occasions trying to convince myself it it. lol but it's not worth it at the current price.
other There isn't a whole lot that i did like about this dress. the shoulders have large poufs, the fabric isn't very soft, and it's not flattering. maybe with a belt i could be tempted, but i wasn't too fond of the dress.
other Just as described by others. soft, great fabric and so comfy.
other I am in love with this skirt! it is the most flattering thing i have purchased in a while. the fabric is a beautiful medium weight knit with a good amount of give. it hugs your curves but doesn't cut in anywhere! i was able to easily go down a size from my usual. i love it so much that i am going to order the other color as well!
other This top is a perfect example of why retailer is heaven. the attention to detail is stunning and it drapes beautifully. i am 5'6" and 140lbs with an average build. an xs fits me perfectly. this top is very flowy. i could wear it until about six months into a pregnancy, yet it is flattering even though i am not currently adding to the human race. it's an investment, but it's high quality and worthy of the price tag.
other The red is so pretty in-person. i love the details on the sleeves... only complaint is the fit is pretty boxy and couldn't size down because it is borderline to short in length. did buy it today and we will see if it work out!!
other I actually like this better on the instagram picture than on the model... anyway, i ordered the xs petite (for 11other lbs, 5'1.5") and it fits really nicely. not too short. the material is nice and soft, nad looks like it may not wrinkles, which would be a bonus... the little gold buttons are super cute, but you can't really wear this untied, so it is pretty much a strictly tied short. sleeves are flattering... i think i may keep it :-)
other I bought the black motif, the design lends to a nice pop of color.  the venting detail on the back is beautiful, but probably not as obvious on the black.  maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers.  i'm usually between a s/m or 6/8 in blouses.  i followed advice from other reviewers and got the 8- for room in the arms.  the blouse is very billowy- much more than in the photos, but i'm wearing it with skinny jeans and i love it!
other I love this poncho! it is flattering (who would have thought i would use that word in the same sentence as a poncho?) and offers enough room for warm clothes underneath.it is stiffer and thicker than i had originally anticipated, and the material is somewhat itchy so i would recommend long sleeves and clothes with more covering underneath.
other Large and the material is too bulky. i returned it.
other I bought this in the reddish color. i was a little skeptical that the fit or style would really work on a petite person but it looks great on. the fabric is very soft but with enough body that the cowl keeps it's shape. i predict that people will get tired of seeing me in this as i'm going to wear it a lot.
other This is an awesome t'shirt and i'm so glad it finally went on sale. i had been eying it for a while: it's true to size, can be dressed up with nice slacks or dressed down with boyfriend jeans. washes great and looks different from other shirts -- the ruffles on the bottom really make a difference. gotten lots of compliments.
other I loved this dress as soon as i saw it online. but the price was high, and i was nervous about taking a chance on a knit dress. would it be too clingy, too stretchy, too scratchy, too...wrong? i took a chance on it after reading other reviews, and as soon as i tried it on, i knew i had found the perfect dress for winter. it is super comfortable, and the quality of the knit is very good. the material is soft and warn. the dress looks fabulous with bright tights and high boots. in the two weeks i
other I just bought this shirt on sale. i'd been eyeing it for a bit and when it went on sale i had to get it. its really cute and comfortable and fits really nicely. it's not too short or boxy and the detail on the sleeves is great.
other Love this top! i just purchased this shirt from my local retailer store. i noticed it when i walked in and saw it on display. it's stylish, comfortable, and subtle. it runs large so size down. normally, i wear a medium in retailer tops but needed a small. the flower print is small and the colors are muted against the black. pairs well with several colors: black (like model), dark denim, olive green, and mauve. the display had it tucked into a soft khaki colored pair of pants that worked as well.
other I loved this top but the cut was too short in the waist for my 5'8" frame. wish it came in a tall size!
other Girls, this dress is gorgeous.  but if you are an a/b cup, there is just too much fabric in the bust.  the entire dress is pleated from the shoulders down, so a curvier figure would be shown to great advantage in this beautiful number.  alas, i had to send it back and was very sad to do so.
3 I ordered this sweater in a medium with high hopes. i'm 5'8" and slender, but with a 36' bust, and the medium was too loose and long (sleeves fell past my wrists). i would exchange this for a small for a better fit, but the color is not the white or cream color i was expecting. the color of this sweat is more of an oatmeal - not flattering on a far-skinned blonde. i think the color would look fantastic on someone with dark hair (as it does on the girl in the photo). the texture is great and i re
other I love pilcros! i have a few pairs and all in 28s, so that's what i ordered, however they are so tight i could even button them! i haven't gained any weight and all my old pairs fit fine... i liked the color and length so much i'm exchanging them for 29s. hopefully that will do the trick!
other This top is just adorable. i'm usually between an xs and a small and i went with the small and it's a little more roomy. i wanted it to be long enough. the colors are beautiful and it's a must have.
3 I ordered these hoping they would look like the model - but they didn't. i am small but curvy. it hugged too tightly in the hips so sadly, these pants are going back.
other This top fits well as expected for the size. i love the ease of the top and wear it both casually and a bit more dressed up. great styling on the back.
other This sweater is so soft and comfortable. looks dressy with skirt and booties or casual with leggings and flats.
3 I really wanted these jeans to work but i am too curvy and not tall enough for them. i just felt like they were swallowing me up with fabric. i am 5'5" and had a stacked boot heel on when i tried them on and they were still too long. i felt like they made me look even bigger than i am. the fabric is nice, not as dark as the photo as others have said.
3 I loved the fabric, cut and style of these shirts, the diamond gather in the front is a problem though. i just went under and snipped the elastic that is sewn on that design to relax it a bit. this shirt washes and wears wonderfully. please make again maybe fix the diamond area so it is not sewn with as much continuous elastic, a space in the sewing on both sides would alleviate that pucker. sill i love this top
other This is a great cold weather alternative to a coat especially in warmer climates. it is lightweight but dense. love the color.
other I bought this coat other years ago and every fall/winter, i can't wait to wear it again. can't even begin to describe how many people comment on how beautiful and unique it is! it has worn well over the years considering how much it has been worn, but i just might be tempted to buy it again (which is something i have never done with a statement piece). the only design feature i would change is that it has no closure. i actually had a beautiful large antique button that i sewed on with a snap and it
other I love this top! it fits perfect and is of great quality! i ordered the pink and love it so much i'm getting the navy one! colors are so trendy as well. this top is so much cuter in person. hard to tell the detail online. definitely recommend to others!
other This bomber really is superb. it's everything you could want in a jacket. beautiful color that goes with so much (i got the pink) and is so trendy this fall. i am 5'other and smaller on top so i purchased the small. i didn't want it too baggy but i probably could've sized up to a medium too.
other I saw this dress in the store in the coral color and tried it on. i am 5'4", 34b, and slender to athletic build. i wear the size other in this dress. as far as sizes go for retailer, i would say it is tts. the slip fits like it should and the dress is flowing. it is not see through as were some of the other silk dresses this summer. it feels so comfortable and makes me feel pretty. it is a flowing dress and meant to fit that way. i waited for it to go on sale and the day it did i purchased it!!!
other Love my jeans, fit great and very flattering. they are a tad snug in my usual size but i think with time they will stretch a bit. receive compliments every time i wear them. if they go on sale i will buy another. :)
other As another reviewer noted, the upper portion (back, chest, shoulders, etc.) fit nicely. however, the body of the dress was enormous and did, indeed, make me look much heavier throughout the middle. back to the store it goes.
3 This is so so soft and has a nice stretch to it. the fit is great, love the side zippers. i wore it today for the first time and before i even arrived at the office i noticed a crazy amount of pilling where my purse rubbed. nothing i cant get rid of (till next time i carry a bag!) but if this keeps up there soon won't be much of a shirt left. very disappointing for the price. was lucky enough to snag this on sale but it was still pricey for the quality.
other I love this vest, bought it in green and want to order white. its very flattering, and i wore it with a black tank top, ripped faded stevie cropped jeans, and gold gladiators. i would like to mention the care. i dripped something on the lapel, so i tried cleaning it off with a wet towel. it made a lighter mark, so i washed as recommended in cold water on gentle in the machine. i hung it to dry, and it dried stiff and a little wrinkled so i threw it in the dryer to soften it up. it lightened up a
other Tracy reese always pleases. this coat is absolutely awesome. it is gorgeous! the faux fur is soft and cozy. this coat is warm. i love the snap closure. this is the sort of attire that makes you feel lovely and is cheerful for those dull winter days. so happy to have in my wardrobe. a collector's item, for sure.
other This coat is a classic! i would wear it every day if it wasn't so distinct. very comfortable, flattering, and stylish.
other I'm always looking for something that is unique and can be layered. this looks just like it does on the model. you'll need a cami underneath as it is not lined. a little shorter in front than in the back but drapes nicely. styled it with black denim ankle jeans, black loafers (or boots), and a blue denim jacket. i'm 118#, 34d, 5'4" and the s fit well.
other I ordered this coat online without trying it on in person. the pictures on the models are stunning. i have a long, mostly rectangular physique with long legs and a little extra love around the middle. i like wearing long sweaters and drapey things that accentuate the positive. i thought this was right up my alley. but, it person it has a weird bunchiness around my middle due to the hidden pockets. the sleeves are a bit too long and the lapels and shoulders make me look beefier than i am up top.
other I bought this to wear to work, but i pictured it as being fancier than it is. the fabric is heavy, stiff sweatshirt material. i bought a small but probably would have been better off with an xs. despite this, it's long enough to be a dress on me, and it is comfortable and cute. it will be nice in the winter and could probably be dressed up some.
other I was not shopping for a dress and somehow came home with this. in person the material and embroidery are just so stunning that i found myself picking it up. i was sold after trying it on. the material is very soft, both feels and looks extremely high quality. and for a basic shirtdress, it is amazingly flattering. follows curves without clinging to them. i'm 5'4", 123 lbs, usually wear a small in tops/dresses & purchased the size 4, which fit perfectly. i'm slightly chesty (34d) so sometimes ha
other This picture does not due this sweater justice, at all! i purchased this today for summer. it's beyond cute and the colors are awesome! it's a very light sweater with a fitted (but not too tight) light feel. the sleeves are a little longer than quarter length, at least on me. it looks amazing with white pants, very fresh!!
other And flattering! i love the feel of the dress, it is flowy, loose but still flattering. i can't wait to wear it with boots. i could go with flats for summer, too, if i wanted to. i have had this dress in my wish list, then i deleted it, but it was in the store as a return in xxs p so i thought, why not! i shouldn't have really, coz now i have to get it... and i did.colors are actually great, i don't know why people have issues "matching" - black or navy are equally neutral in my books...f
other The quality and fabric are fabulous but it's just too voluminous for my figure (5'8", 15other lbs), would look great on someone more slender.
3 This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back, and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping, and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this, but as it is i will keep the one
other Nice to have colors rather than a solid top. i actually bought the pink also because i like the fit so much. i'm 5'8", 140 and wear a size 6, tts. i like the cut and it's long enough, which can sometimes be a problem for me.
other Gorgeous soft colors that can be worn with many things. lightweight fabric with beautiful detailed finish to the neckline. i purchased at my local retailer store along with the baroque tee (that i purchased in a smaller size because of the differences in the design of the two shirts). highly recommend both!
other Love this dress! i bought the blue motif. which barely has any blue at all. it is the softest cotton dress i own. i wore it with my red hunter boots today and it made for the best rainy day ensemble. love, love! and i got it on sale which just sweetens the deal :)
other I bought the first skirt at the store. loved it so much i went online and found this one and bought it too!
other Gorgeous, but so big. i got eh pxs and it's like a mumu. i wiill return
other I don't normally like how i look in rompers but this one was so cute i had to try.  i was pleasantly surprised that it fit great and was comfortable too!
3 I ordered this after seeing the rave reviews. it is not for me. just like the culottes i ordered, this romper makes me feel like a grandma. i said i'd recommend to others bc of the other reviews but again, this was not for me. i also didn't like the back of the romper. no way i could even get away with a racerback bra b/c it's so low cut. the good though- it is super comfortable and is a nice heavy fabric. tts also. i'm a med 8/10 and the medium was correct in this.
other This sweater is a dull off white color. it looks old fashioned. don't get.
3 This jacket is beautiful. the color is so nice and the cut of the jacket is perfect. however, one i put it on, i couldn't wait to get it off. it's so itchy!! i tried putting on a long sleeve shirt under it but was still uncomfortable. especially around my neck. i wouldn't recommend this jacket based on the material alone. also, the jacket runs large. i'm 5'1" 130 lbs 34d and i ordered the small. i would definitely size down.
other Great pants! great fall colors. great for day or night. super fun and funky. love them!
other I just got these and had to return them as they were not becoming on my physique. for reference, i'm5' 5"; 12other lbs; 26" waist; 38"hips and i have a long torso and short legs. i ordered a 29 petite. the fitwas tight, but they are supposed to fit tight. if i wasn't so "hippy" i would have kept them. the model isslender with long legs and she looks fantastic in them. not me. i do recommend these as they are cute, but perhaps geared for a more slender body type.
other This is a beautiful dress for fall. the fabric is gorgeous and drapey and the skirt is swingy. i ordered this in an xl because that size always sells out first. i think a l might fit a bit better, so i will see if any more come in and order another to compare. it poofs out in the back above the elastic and the waist slides down a bit. it is also very long, i need to hem it about 3-4". i never know which size to order with this brand, i vary between l and xl.
other I loved this top, but had to return because the stiff applique made me look like a linebacker! i wish it could have worked out, because this is a cool top. if this particular design works for you, go for it!
other I was just at the store and purchased this cute top which runs tts for me. i wasn't expecting to find anything at the store but the beautiful lace and adorable tie at the front caught my eye so i bought the small which is my usual size at retailer (34d-27-35) and it fits perfectly. the material is a touch thin but that's okay with me since i don't want heavy clothes for the warmer months anyway. i also don't find this top particularly see through as it's black and will wear a full coverage bra wit
other I wanted to love this dress, but it has too many flaws. first, the "waistband" falls right under the bust and the skirt flares out from there. not a flattering silhouette.. second, the fabric is a sickly yellow-beige netting that looks like burlap. third, i can't imagine what kind of bra you can wear under it. on the plus side, the fabric isn't scratchy.
3 I got this top in my typical size medium and wanted to love it...it is such a good idea and i loved it on the model! however, it failed in translation for me, and i will be returning. the bottom of the top is very loose, but the top clings to my chest (36dd), pulling awkwardly and gapping on the sides. not worth exchanging for a large, since the bottom of the top is already to loose..
other I agree with the other reviewer that the color isn't as pink in person and more subtle. my thoughts below on some other things:__________pros:- pockets! makes it so fun and chic with the overall style.- the material is lovely and breathable. i didn't find it sheer at all! of course, i didn't wear it outside the dressing room. the material is thicker but it hangs on the body well.- runs "mostly" tts. i only tried on the medium and it fit everywhere being slightly tighter in the chest. i
other I took advantage of the promotional discount offered on this coat. i admired this soon as it appeared.  hesitant to purchase without any reviews, nor had opportunity to visit the store so i took a chance.  i love the pattern, burgundy wine faux fur collar, the fit. colors are true. i sized up which i recommend. glad i did, this will require thick sweater to provide any type of warmth if you are in a colder climate.  length mid-knee. imo not worth full price.  eleveness does design pretty coats!
other I really love the look and feel of this top, perhaps this was mentioned in previous reviews, but it is unlined, which i hadn't realized when i ordered it. so the eyelet details are will expose skin unless you wear a cami underneath.
other This dress is very versatile - it will be cool and comfortable in the summer, but one could also wear it with leggings or skinny jeans in the winter with a sweater or jacket. it can be worn casually with a belt, or dressed up with a statement necklace and earrings for a night out. the black color is more like a charcoal grey, which suits me fine. grab it while you can - it's a good deal for the current sale on sale price!
other Shirt fits great! i wore it for work and got lots of complements. looks very elegant. i also got the pants featured on the model since i liked the outfit so much ;)
other Cool cut and texture a winner
other I saw this in the store in blue and loved it. wore it and received lots of compliments. just bought the second color online as there is free shipping today. great dress for work as the weather is warming up.
other Very pretty top, but like the other reviewers said?the neck is very itchy. i live in florida and i don't think i can wear this during the summer unless i get the neck lined. i got an xxs p which was a little shorter than i would have liked, so i am returning for xxs.
3 This top looks adorable in the product photos, so i had high hopes. i think i might be too short to pull it off, but like another reviewer said, i found it to be like a tent on me, billowing out in all directions. it was just overall too big on me--i even considered whether i could wear it as a dress, but the sleeves were also too billowy on me. i am 5'4", 120 lbs and tried the xs.
other This is a nice and comfortable shirt. i'm 5'7 and i have triple d size bra and i got my shirt in size m. it fits perfectly and my breasts are not showing too big and the shirt is not too tight. it's more of a casual style, possibly because of the fabric that was made of. nothing fancy but a very nice every-day shirt to go with skinny jeans or a skirt. it covers belly really well and it does look nice and slim around the waist. i'm pretty pleased with my purchase.
other I love the style of this jumpsuit. it is so much more interesting than a long dress. i am 5' 7" and need a few inches hemmed which will cut off some of the pretty embroidery at the bottom. my biggest regret with this is that it is not made from better fabric. it is a little stiff and scratchy. if it were more silky it would be a dream. but i am happy to have this in my closet. i purchased this in the berry red.
other I tried this dress on in the store and ended up ordering it online during the dress sale. it is extremely flattering and really accentuates the waist. it is very comfortable, and made of a nice, soft fabric. i am a 34a and it just barely reveals a tiny bit of cleavage so i don't find the neckline too low. i plan to wear it with tights and booties. i am 5' 4" and the regular xs comes to a bit below my knees. going to enjoy wearing this lovely dress!
other I can only review the ivory as that was the only color in my local store. this sweater is very flattering as it is fitted on top but has a nice flow over the hips plus the zipper allows for more room or to show off an underlying top. the material is soft and the ivory is very pretty in person.
other I love this top! it is sheer, so wear a cami, but it so pretty, i will wear it a lot! a winner for sure.
other Super soft and colors are great. i got the navy and plan to wear with white jeans and platforms, similar to the photo. would also look great with black skinny pants. worth it for the sale price.
other I love bows,this dress is very cute and flattering, while being comfortable. it may be sleeveless, but i think with the right boots and cardigan, it can be brought into fall easily. color is a nice green. i tried on both the 00p and 0p, and though i loved the fit of the 00p better (width), i preferred the length of the 0p - otherwise, not much difference there... i think it is well worth keeping it, even though i don't need yet another dress... material is pretty comfortable too. back is lower
3 I absolutely love the look and fit of these jeans. i did have to size down. i ran into problems after washing. the fraying on one leg was twice that of the other, looking very unbalanced. after looking closely i found that one leg had a top stitching very close to the fray to prevent further fraying. the other leg did not have this stitching, thus the fraying double in size. i have sent a request to customer service for a replacement pair. these are adorable jeans just be sure to check for stitc
other Feminine with beading in front. love the neckline and flow. nice fall colors. sleeves button. really nice fit in shoulders. if you like this style it is absolutely beautiful on. may be short on those with long torsos.
other I am normally a size medium or small at retailer (depending on the bust) and could not even get the medium in this top past my neck. it runs very small. unfortunately the size large was not in stock for me to try. truthfully, i might have needed the xl in this - it runs that small. for reference, i am 5'6", 14other lbs, 34dd. also, the beading on the top i tried was coming loose and some was already missing. seems to be a common fault based on what other reviewers have said.
other Love this shirt and the print. i would wear it all the time if socially acceptable. i've only worn it once but have already gotten so many compliments. there are hints of neon in the coloring that can't really be seen in the pictures. i saw it in store and fell in love and then decided to splurge when i saw it online and couldn't think of life without it.
other After reading the reviews i was hoping to be able to try this on in store. i was able to try on a xxs and a xs in the store on the sale rack. i tried both on and i usually will take an xs or small in sweaters. funny, but the xxs seemed to be a little longer in the front and the fit is nicer on me. after reading others review of this sweater i thought for sure it would be super short on the xxs but it wasn't. just goes to show you should always try on first! i did not feel that the sleeves were l
3 Wish i'd noticed that the sleeve cuff and hem were 'cut' to look hippie-casual. i'm taking this back with great regret. it's soft and the prettiest pale lime-sherbet color; made for a cool summer look. i don't like 'tattered,' though - so back it goes. sigh. it's soft, true fit, and beautiful. i'd buy it in many colors and in the lovely lavender print if it wasn't for the 'cuts.'
other Light and flows so nicely. a great length--not to short or long. great with shorts. material is lovely.
other I splurged on this top and was sadly disappointed. i'm a 36d, and the l was so tight i couldn't get it over my chest. also the arms were super tight and the length is nearly cropped.  and the fabric is shiny, the picture makes it look like it's matte. if it did fit like the model i would've loved it. the print is beautiful though. bummer
3 The colors look better in person and the sweater knit is thinner than i expected (which is actually a plus in my opinion) so i was very happy when i opened the package, unfortunately the fit was off for me. the lower part and the back are perfect, the dress hangs nicely, no puffing, no stiffness. however, the upper part at the front was tight and something about the armholes made my arms and upper body look beefy (i promise i usually don't have this problem). i am 32a and routinely order xs. the
other I wore this blazer for one day, didn't do anything strenuous, and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back, next to the center seam. it's completely unfixable, since it's not the seam that split but the fabric itself. what a waste of money.as to the fit, it is a boxy cut through the waist. it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned. the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it, so it's good over something cute.or, it would be, if it didn't fall apart.
other I ordered  flora nikrooz for my daughter for her wedding.  it is beautiful. the delivery was quick!!! very happy.
other These leggings are beautiful and different. the material is very stretchy, sort of a spandex feel. panty lines definitely show in the back. i found they run true to size; i wear a size 6/medium/28 in pants or jeans and the size medium fit me great.
other I really love this dress and want to buy it, but i won't buy it in white. it is just too easy to get dirty. i would love a pretty blue or even a darker yellow.
other I thought the dress in store for true to size and was a bit more 'swinging' style. i am 5'7, athletic and the small fit perfect.
other This has been my go to top every time i go out lately. i just make sure i am with different people. the length is perfect and not too long. i wear a strapless black bra and you cannot see through the shirt. the only thing i don't like about it, is the three buttons in the back at the top are very, very difficult to button.
other I've never bought a tee at full price, in so many colors. i love this tee.it's quite possibly the most perfect fit ever. the material is thick and hangs well without being stiff or bulky. i'm 5'other -117lbs usually a small petite or 4p but purchased the regular small so i can wear this with skinny or regular jeans. i purchased the purple, navy and black and may go back for the yellow. the white is still a little too sheer fir me otherwise i would have purchased it. wish they had a light grey versio
other Very soft, cozy, and exactly what is needed on tbose in-between days. the collar is a bit dramatic if you are petite, but there is an extra button that makes it more manageable. stylish, cute
other Simply awesome. wonderful fit and flatters any body type. looks great booties, flats, or flip flops. must have ...
other I "studied" this dress for weeks before i finally bought it. i am soooo glad i bought it. much more fabulous than the picture. soft, quality denim that is not too heavy for summer. very fitted on top. love the pockets and the torn hem.
other I have several of these tanks from last year and bought new colors this year. i have found the fit to be easy and relaxed, but not baggy. they are very flattering. i wear them thru the fall and winter as layering pieces under sweaters and flannel shirts as well. i was them in cold water, delicate cycle, hang to dry and they are good to go. they have held up well - even the ones that are 2+ years old are still going strong with no holes or tears.
other This dress is super sweet, but also unique with the reversed fabric on the skirt. it is true to size, unlike a lot of retailer clothes that seem to be boxy/run big. the fabric bunches a little bit at the waist though -- that's my only complaint.
other I love this soft, glistening, flowy beauty!  it's my favorite color too!  i'm 5'5", 34d, size 6 and a small fit me with room to spare.  don't wait!
3 I love the pattern of this shirt but there is definitely a design flaw in the arm/armpits.
other This reminds me of the 1970's. the fabric is soft and it looks just like the picture. i'm ordering it in line in a petite. my store doesn't carry petites. it's typical moth quality and fit. perfect.
other Bought this in the green because i thought it was a bit different. it is super flattering and the fabric is so soft and comfortable. i have it in an xs and a s and haven't yet decided which i am keeping as they both work. i'm 5'4" and 116#. going to wear it on an upcoming trip and i think i will get a lot of use out of it during the rest of the summer into the early fall. i saw the black too and am tempted to buy that as well. have i mentioned i love this dress?
other This is a true retailer dress, cute and quirky. kudos for the built-in liner (with scalloped hem, very pretty) and pockets. i like the colorful yet subtle embroidered ice cream sticks on the dress, and the white background makes the colors and details really pop (pun intended!). i echo the previous reviewers that the bust is very small. i usually wear size other regular in this brand (i?m 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips. i?m 5?2?, and the bottom hem falls right at the upper knees). but when i tried on size 6,
other Really cute version of a sweatshirt. fits true to size through the shoulders and bust line; however, since i am larger in the bust area than the hip, the lower half of the top looks slightly large on my body. the sweatshirt is cut very straight, so it would probably flatter a person with a pear or straight shape. the inside material of the sweatshirt is a little rough; however, the appliquã© design makes this shirt a keeper.
other Although this shirt runs a little large, the snowflske and stripes makes it a classic. very comfortable shirt.
3 So i was super excited to get this skirt, unfortunately it's not what i thought it would be. the color is much different then what pictured, it has bronze threading and the black on the picture is more gray in real life. the material isn't so great easier, i thought it would be thicker but instead it's pretty thin and wrinkles easy. the design is very cute and it is a flattering shape but the material is just too poor for me to give this a good rating. i wouldn't say it's itchy like the other re
other I was running low on good summer shorts and thought i'd try these based on having a pair of the pilcro cropped pants i got a couple months ago. i tried these shorts on in-store to make sure they fit right and that i liked how they looked but then bought them online (more colors were available in my size than what they had in store). i bought these in 3 different colors and i absolutely love them all! they are my go-to shorts now, they look good with the legs rolled up or down, and i will be wear
other I really wanted to love the shorts.  when i read that the shorts were lined, i expected them to be lined so that my underwear didn't show.  even though the shorts are lined, you can see through the fabric completely.  this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design; pockets; and, comfortable waistline.  i'm returning the shorts as well.
other This shirt is so comfortable and looks very nice with jeans or work pants. it's a great shirt!
other I got this for my girlfriend and was happy they had additional sizes online as we were not able to find this in the store. we loved that this could be worn stand alone, with leggings, or as an over-shirt. it's very versatile and is perfect for your fall wardrobe.
other Overall great romper! i have a long torso and thicker legs so i sized up to a small and i am very happy i did. the shorts are a bit on the shorter side and go upon the sides so another reason to consider sizing up. the quality is great and super soft chambray with a trendy tie up.
other I purchased this when it was on sale and it is a great, comfortable, and forgiving top. this top again runs a bit large, so i ordered a size down and it fits great. i think that they are off a bit on their description of the color. i ordered ?pink? but i would consider it more of an orangish red color. not my favorite but not terrible either. overall it is a great shirt.
other If all the tops i ordered from retailer this summer, this top is my fav. it is a crowd pleaser! my friend called it my "art shirt." the fabric is nice and the cut hangs nice on my other ft other 170 pound frame. the armholes are a little big, so i just wear a red bra with it and it's great.
other I very rarely pay full price for anything, let alone this much for a t-shirt. but i actually paid full price for this in two colors. that's how much i love this shirt. the pink and the turquoise are beautiful, and i'm thinking of asking for the mauve for christmas. i love how heavy the weight is, the length of the torso is long enough, the length of the sleeves is actually long enough. i love the ribbon down the back. it's flattering and comfy and perfect. i'm 5'8", 140lbs, 34b and the small fit
other The color and the fabric in these shorts is quite nice as is the length. i didn't order the pilcro bermudas because another reviewer said the legs were quite wide. unfortunately, these shorts also have wide legs. i'm going to have them tailored so they hug the legs as in the picture rather than billowing out. i do not have skinny thighs(don't i wish!) and i was surprised that the fit was not as pictured. if you're ok with wide legs or can get them at a price at which you're ok spending extra for
other This dress had so much potential. the top was absolutely gorgeous. my issue was with the bottom half of the dress. the bottom is made from a heavy quilted material that is stiff and has no movement at all. the dress is supposed to fit like a modified mermaid dress where its more fitted around the hips and flares out, the dress i received had so much material on the bottom that it actually made my hips look bigger. i though about having the dress altered but decided to return instead.
other Love these jeans! they fit great, they feel great. i am 5'9.other 13other pounds. they fit everywhere you would like them to. unroll them and they are long! love love love!! so wonderful i just bought my second pair.
other I tried on the xs in the store and decided to size down (and get xxs petite). it looked much better. the length was flattering, and as others mentioned, the bottom is nice and flowy. it is comfortable, and the orange color is flattering and i love the striped detail on the sides. good casual dress, but i can dress it up with a bejeweled belt. i am 11other lbs 30dd chest for xxs petite...
other I tried the green one on in the store, as my store only had the green. the lace was sort of fuzzy-looking and i couldn't tell if the items were shop-worn or if the lace was supposed to look like that. since they all looked that way, i decided it was the look of the original fabric and i tried it on. i do like the combination of the lace sleeves and v-neck. a bit dressy but casual also. although i sometimes appreciate a little forgiveness in the tummy area, in this case the design was too loose a
3 This is so bulky and itchy...could not stand to have it on! i'm a 6/8 & ordered the small, but it was still gigantic.
other In the photo, this looks like a heavy knit top, but it's not. the fabric is very light, thin, and soft. it's like a knit nightgown material. i said this runs big b ecause i'm normally a size xl and i can wear this. it actually fits me a little less flowy than on the model and i think looks better. so, to me, you can size down if you want this not to have so much flowing fabric.the front criss-crosses over and it will stay together at the top area with movement. the two fabric pieces sort of
other Overall i really like this dress. the color is vibrant & unique. the top of the dress especially the shoulder straps seem loose so i'm getting it tailored.
other Great tee! flows well and very soft. true to size!
other I bought these pants on a whim while i was at my local retailer. i was so delighted after trying them on because i've never tried on a pair of linen pants that i actually liked. they definitely have more of a flair leg rather than straight leg like the picture suggests. i wore them for several hours at a party and they didn't stretch that much on me. i agree with the other review in that they do get a little wrinkly but not much more than what i would expect from linen fabric. i'm 5'3" so t
3 I couldn't believe there weren't more reviews complaining about the arm size... then i found them!  yes, this is a cute shirt, if you have toothpicks for arms!  so true!  the shirt is adorable... a bit guazy (so not going to be super warm for fall/winter... but i live in cali so that's not an issue).  but, my arms aren't even big, and this shirt is so snug around my arms!  unfortunately it's going back :(
other I bought this in-store after seeing it online, and am in love with the shape! the cropped legs give it a style advantage in my opinion.  for reference i'm 5'6" 120lbs and a bcup. i got the xs. the torso was too baggy and lost it's shape with a small.  as one reviewer mentioned it seems to be meant to be worn with a shirt underneath. i've tried with longer sleeved tops and with tank tops and they both look great - especially white. it has a modern cut and is very versatile. i plan to wear
other Adorable peplum top! colors are much more rich in person. saw it in the store and stalked it online until it went on sale. beautiful material and craftsmanship. i thought it ran on the large side though wish it was a touch longer but not enough to not purchase. highly recommend....great piece to dress up or down and easily add layers for fall.
other This top is a very comfortable, very easy top to wear. it is perfect for laying with work clothes or styling a bit more casually for just wearing out and about. i ordered it in the light blue color and it is beautiful- very soft and feminine. the ruffle lays really well down the front, which i was concerned about because of how busty i am. i ordered a small and it fits just right. i think the knit back really helps with that. very nice!
other Super soft, cozy cardigan! i have a long torso and this is just the right length to cover my behind! i wish retailer would carry more sweaters with this shape. the sweater is soft and light - perfect for every day and you could wear it year round, although with its lighter weight, it might not be as perfect for winter. i purchased this in the kelly green color and it's gorgeous. i have it on right now!
other I really love this tee! but, the fit can be boxy so i ordered it online in a size 0 and am very happy with how it fits me. i've worn it with skinny jeans and have gotten complimented repeatedly.
other Beautifully fitting. simple and flattering. i am an athletic size 8/10. the 10 fits well but the straps may have to be taken in a little.
other I ordered this dress in oatmeal the minute i saw it online. i'm 5'other and 11other lbs. and my usual xs fits perfectly. i would say this dress will be the most flattering on a long lean body type. (it will show bumps and bulges.). i will wear it asap with booties and a jacket. and it also looks great with flip flops or sandals for the summer. very happy!
other This skirt fits great. the thick material helps it lay nicely and smooth the curves. i'm 5-4" about 130lbs, athletic build with a bottom and the med fit well.
3 Nice jeans, just fyi they look more slimly fitted in the photo than they actually are when you get them. that's why i returned them. otherwise, fine.
other This is a subtle, classy shirt. i'm 5'7, 12other lbs and an xs fit perfectly. shirts like these, that don't fit snugly on my back cover my poor posture (genetic) and make me look like i am standing up straight. nice!
other Crazy soft and comfy.  light weight so will be great for spring/ summer and layering.  so happy i bought it.
other I love this shirt, very comfortable and has a nice drape. i originally bought the size i normally wear but found it to be a little tight across my chest, so i returned for the next size up.very well made and not sheer so did not have to wear a tank underneath.
other This top is really pretty and flattering. i bought my usual size and its loose and flows without being too boxy. the pattern is beautiful and the band on the top stays up well.
other These colors!!!  my cup of tea!  i love everything about this top, from the fit, to the raw edge of the neck trim. it does seem like it will wrinkle easily but i can manage that for its sheer beauty!
other Great material. a bit loose in the middle / lower half. doesn't belt well. it could be 3" shorter, considering alterations. i'm 5'7" the model is 5'10", so yeah 3" shorter would be cute!
3 I really wanted to love this dress. i thought i might be able to dress it up for a wedding i'm attending, but it was kind of a serious no go. first off, i ordered a petite size, but it was still longer than on the model--i'm 5'5', so not even technically petite, but i thought it might be a better length for me that way. it was not a great length, and the pleats and pockets (which would be great in theory) make the skirt fully (and pouffier at the waist) than i would have liked. i love the way th
other These are great jeans and worth every penny. they hug every curve and have just enough give in the places that you need them. i find them to be very figure-flattering and dressed them up with high heeled boots and a nice blouse. even though i'm petite, i ordered a regular in my size (26) because i wanted the length of regular jeans as opposed to ankle length.
other This t-shirt is very casual, so it is perfect for everyday use. touch of textile is comfortable, so i feel relaxed whenever wearing this t-shirt. although stripe is a simple design, it does not limit your choise of fashion, so it can go with almost anything. just be aware that this t-shirt runs a little larger than the true size.
3 I was excited to receive this top because i love the design, but was very disappointed when it arrived. i thought the embroidery would be striking but it's not. the material is a t-shirt knit which also added to the disappointment. it was not flattering at all.
other This skirt is absolutely beautiful and in my opinion, totally worth the price. it's very, very well made and fits perfectly. i usually wear a size other but with skirts that are supposed to sit right at my waist, i size down to other so they fit properly. i did that with this one and i have to wiggle a bit to get it past my hips but once on it fits like a glove. i'm 5'11" and the skirt comes to mid-calf on me which is exactly what i was looking for. love love love this skirt, i totally recommend it.
other Alright ladies...this jacket!! its even better than it appears online. the green anorak fabric has a little stretch to it and is super comfortable. because of the stretch, i was able to do a large instead of my normal xl. but the real show stopper is the fringed sweater. it is gorgeous. it lays beautifully open or closed and is so soft and warm. the design has so much detail to it. there is also this amazing tie in back so you can cinch the waist if you want. this jacket will look amazing with a
other It's navy and red--the photo looked black to me. so i couldn't use with black skirt that i had planned to pair it with, but it's cute with jeans and maybe white shorts next summer. the front gapes open when you sit down, so i'll either have to pin it or sew a snap there unless i want the world to see my bra. also a little short waited for me--i'm 5"11", so i wish the wrap hit a little lower, but not enough that i didn't keep it. it is flattering blouse. the shoulder ties add a little extra flair
3 This is a bit more jacket-ish than i expected. the material is kind of scratchy, and it was heavier than expected. it has a lining in it, like a jacket lining. i wasn't a fan of the clasps on the front. i guess they are meant to be invisible, but they are literally little metal clasps. it is more cropped in the length than i expected, and i don't have a particularly long torso. i like the embroidery. the pattern is lovely. the fit is about spot on. i am about a 12/1other with a 38c bust and the l fi
other Love this dress! it is tighter in the chest area than maybe expected, but not unwearable, though i am smaller chested. it will be great for hot summer days as it has a light lining.
other This top is gorgeous and it fits much better in real life than pictured on the model. the back is made of soft cotton crochet and it curves beautifully on your lower back emphasizing your lower assets and if you have great shoulders and arms you're going to love this top because your shoulders will stand out. it's made of a light weight linen-cotton fabric. it's very soft and doesn't wrinkle as easily as most linen does, it feels soft on the skin, light-weight, and has a nice bounce to it. it's
other I'm other ft 7 12other lbs true size other and these pants made me look like i had boy parts. super disappointed!
other Bought this for my girlfriend and she couldn't be happier! she's a size 4/34c and the small fits perfectly and is so flattering and comfortable. highly recommend.
other I wanted this dress so much, i ordered it twice. both times the zipper was defective--it would get stuck midway up, at the waistline--so i had to send it back (there isn't an retailer in my area). this is a shame because it's got great colors and looks flattering on, and i was looking forward to pairing it with a cardigan/boots for fall. i even thought about taking it to a seamstress to have the zipper replaced, but the cost didn't seem worth it. too bad, as it seems like it would be a nice
other I love the colors, my favorite. purchased a medium and fits perfectly. i've been wearing it all summer. material is thin but super soft. for reference i am 5'8" 14other lbs 32dd. i'm obsessed with this tank. considering buying a second just in case anything happens to the one i have, that's how much i love this tank.
3 This dress (i ordered the ivory) is stunning. it is fully lined, the belt adds a needed accent, and the print on the fabric is gorgeous. the fit, though, is another issue. i typically wear a 2-other depending on the cut and fabric of dresses, and am pretty proportionate with my hips/bust. i ordered a other in this dress. it was enormous on the top and painfully tight on my hips and thighs. the fabric has absolutely no give - it needs to drape perfect or it looks awful. if you have any type of hip, thigh
other This is one of my absolute favorite dresses of the season! fun, flirty and fashionable! i wore it with a chunky necklace, floppy hat and sandals one time and with wedges and dangly earrings the other time. it is a must own dress!
other Light and distinctive design. the fabric seems somehow synthetic and in very warm weather might become not so fresh
other Super simple top that's comfy. i like a looser fit and its boxy- both things i like. seems like it will be a staple piece.
other Can't go wrong with these new charlie's by cartonnier. they fit amazingly. the fabric is a textured cotton but doesn't seem to wrinkle. just shook them out of the bag yesterday. the fabric description says cotton and spandex so they have some give (just a little) but are not going to stretch out after wearing for an hour. paired it with all sorts of different tops. side zip is slimming. lined pockets. substantial fabric. nothing bad to say. if you haven't tried a pair of charlies you should. you
other I tried on the red xs in the store and the v-neck was way too low. showed at least an inch of my bra strap in the back, which was unfortunate because i really loved the dress otherwise. i decided to purchase the xxs online hoping the v would not be so deep and would cover my bra. it did, but the xxs was significantly smaller! it still fit, but took this from an elegantly flowy and loose dress to one that looked more empire cut and tight in the chest. maybe the xs i tried in the store was just st
other This dress is beautiful and unique. an eye-catching piece with a bohemian flare. you will not be disappointed. tts.
other Height: 5'2"weight: 118-120 lbsbust: 34b or 32cwaist: 27"-28"hips: 37"-38"i like this dress a lot, but it would have required tailoring the skirt. i'm petite, but for whatever reason most regular sized clothing fit me well, and petites clothes are usually too short in the arms or legs for me. the midi length is better suited to taller women. in the photo it looks like it hits just below the model's knee, but on me it hit below the fullest part of my calf.i ordered the 0 and the 2
other I had been eying this dress online for a while and when it finally came into stores i was so excited! this dress is so gorgeous and very flattering on my body. i love the bottom of it, it is more of a u cut in the front and square in the back. add an ada wrap belt and perfection!
other Very cute top, just as pictured, nice soft material, color is bright and true to size. wore it to work today on casual friday and received many compliments. highly recommend!
other Although true to size, i sized up to improve pocket placement and for a longer and slouchier fit like on the model. the pockets in my regular size were almost too high up and made my midsection look bunchy.
other These are very cute but very, very stiff. have washed 3x and still not relaxing. not a bad thing but they are a little uncomfortable the first hour of wear. my waist is smaller and generally, have gap in waist to get fit right in hips. super cute with sandals, mules, duck boots.
other Nice shirt that's a little different from the typical. flirty sleeves that move in the wind which is a great look :)
other I love this top. the design is beautiful and the fit is flattering. it's so pretty. the top has great movement and pairs well with so many things. the top hits somewhere around my waist but wasn't too short. i highly recommend this top.
other This is such a cute top. perfect for fall layered with a sweater!
other I tried this on in the store and thought the flowy fit and asymmetrical hem were great. the fabric is thin, which is nice for summer, but lined at the top half so it's not transparent except below the knee. the waist is quite high and has flexible elastic for an easy fit. i liked the skirt a lot and came online to find it in petite. sadly, it is sold out of most sizes in the petite length. i wish antrho would order more of the petite sizes because they seem to sell out fast!
other I bought two of these in xs. i am 5'1other and 150lbs. i started with the size small but that was to big, so down to a size xs and that was perfect. the color ivory/white is really nice, is not see through (i wear nude bras) and it goes with everything. i also didn't see any loose strings falling out of it like another reviewer said...quality material. the burnt orange is really nice too, perfect for fall. love the pockets. just make sure you size down one or two. i am usually a size medium to a lar
other I love charlie pants. i've bought a few in the past, and i've never been disappointed with quality, style, or fit. i love the side zip on these and the nice flat front as a result. i wish more pants were side zip- so much more flattering than having that part stick out under fitted shirts. i got these in a 4, my usual size, and while they fit a little more snugly than my other size other charlie pants, there is enough stretch that they don't look or feel too tight. i also got these in the regular, r
other This dress looks lovely on the model, but it looks just awful on me!i am 5'4" and curvy. the shoulders are cut w/ a weird shape. instead of a cap sleeve, it is like a pointy cap on the side and stuck out on my shoulders. it looks like i am ready to get beamed into space.the material is nice and the sequins are pretty, but the cut of the dress is unflattering.
3 I was excited to receive this top and wanted to love it; however, the side ruffles flared out more than i expected. it didn't look right on me so had to return it :(
other It's definitely not a $100  blouse, but i took advantage of the sale on sale and gotta say i love it! it's slightly sheer, but with a plain nude bra it's fine. beautiful details, very retro, light and breezy. wearing it to work and with jeans.
3 I agree the light colored portion of dress is not vanilla; it is more beige color. i liked the dress a lot, it had a flattering fit on me, extremely comfortable and then i noticed the black mesh portion at top of dress. it did not lay flat at the outer sides between the mesh and floral fabrics like the picture. it poked out on both sides at least 1" which suddenly made the dress look cheap and ill fitting. i can guess either the mesh pattern piece was not cut correctly or it was not sewn correct
other This top is lovely! exquisite embroidery in a silvery-beige color compliments the deep plum. the fit is close to highlight your curves, while being just a touch comfy. very chic for a jazzed up outfit for a night out with jeans or black pants and your best booties. i wear a size 8 normally and the medium fits me perfectly. my body type is curvy and athletic.
other Love this shirt, but beware that it shrinks if you place it in the dryer. the good news is my teen daughter loves it, too, and benefited from my mistake. i usually wear a s or size 6 and bought this in a medium the second time around to allow for dryer.
other Love this skirt!  i purchased the chino skirt during the summer and wore it weekly.  this skirt is the fall equivalent!  flattering and true to size!  there is some stretch to it so it's very comfortable.  highly recommend!
other I got the ivory. it's very cute under the split back cloth & stone button down denim in slightly oversized top (i wear sm but bought the med in the denim button down). this top in ivory runs true to size but the dark colors in sm fit like a medium. the top snags easily. it 's pricey but i love it.
other I have been eyeing these jeans the last few times i have been in retailer shopping but did not really need another expensive pair of jeans. today i finally gave in and tried them on. i fell in love and bought them. i sized down one size. they are so darn cute!! i ended up also buying the pilcro em jeans too. loving pilcro' new cuts and styles lately. the embroidery on these jeans is unique and they are really flattering. already planning to wear them out to lunch with friends tomorrow. highly reco
other I fell in love with this top online and was even more pleased when it arrived. it's pure romance in a top. i went to the store and they didn't have it in yet, so i ordered it at the store. free shipping if ordered from store. i was extremely thrilled with everything about this purchase.
other I was hesitant to purchase this coat because of the price, and when i received it i have to admit i was a little disappointed with the quality of the coat. the sleeves are made out of a soft felted material but i can see this pilling easily. other than that, the silhouette of the coat is perfect...not too boxy! it's also not too heavy so that you can wear it through fall and into the first months of winter. i love it!
3 I was very excited to try out this dress. i've been looking for a velvet dress for a couple of years now, and.. i'm not digging this one. the fabric itself was a let down right off the bat. it's cheap looking to me. i've seen nice velvet and this is very shiny, thin, and slightly sheer! the dress cut itself is what i was expecting, a loose baby doll type dress. the length hit above my knees. the overall effect made me feel very "gypsy-ish"...my husband gave a firm no! when he saw me walk out of
other Fun and elegant!this cape is my favorite purchase in a long time! the juxtaposition of the black and red body against the grey faux fur collar is stunning! it has brass detail snaps up and down both sides as well as at the generous pockets at natural length on both sides. it is very well made of good quality materials, as all tracey reese pieces have been in my experience.it does run true to size as it is an oversized piece, which adds to its classy dramatic flare! it is comfortable to wear
other I bought both the small and the medium and seem to be right in between. the small is a tad tight through the shoulders and arms, but the medium feels a bit baggy. it is soft and hangs nicely - i just need to figure out if i will wear it enough to justify the price.
3 I didn't fall in love with this jacket but it was comfortable and seems like it has potential to be flattering on many body types. for reference i tried on a medium and my measurements are 38-30-40.
other Seeking the perfect "go-to" dress? this one will work for day or night, and it's an ideal match for transition seasons. the best part? the cut. swing dresses and shifts can "tent" my slightly "top-heavy" frame. this dress brags a side-zipper and slight tapering through waist to create an a-line. the small petite fits tts for me at 5'other size other to 4. the fabric is a high-quality, textured fabric - wrinkle free, and a great pick for travel. best investment i've made this spring.
other Absolutely stunning. the color, the pattern, the quality. i love everything about this top.
3 This runs a bit on the large side. i ordered my usual m and had room to spare. the green color was lovely, but between the fit and the scratchy fabric, this is headed back. too bad!
other Great tee! the color online is lighter and nicer in my opinion than in reality. it's much darker in real life, but otherwise it's a super soft tee with gently fluttered sleeves and side slits. i bought it in a s and it's roomy without being oversized. great for fall....
3 I liked that this was a unique take on a sweatshirt. pretty seam down the back and weight of material. i'm going to return it because i wish it was a little more of a loose/baggy fit and under-pattern is darker than i thought.
other I usually wear a medium in jackets, took a chance with the small in this coat. it fits well, the arms are a bit snug but not too snug. beautiful design though. biggest disappointment was quality. i thought the jacket would be thick and warm. it's pretty thin, will test out warmth soon. overall decent purchase, would buy again.
other My local retailer had one of these skirts in store, presumably a return. i was so excited when i found out that it was in my size! i'm 5'7 and usually a other or other at retailer and bought the other for reference. the skirt is made of a heavy fabric and the pockets are lined with paisley fabric! the seams look really sturdy and the skirt moves well. it's very cute and super easy to wear. i styled it with brown boots, an retailer belt and a white button down. great for spring/summer xx
other This color is perfect: deep and rich. it is exactly as it looks on-line. the velvet is super-soft on the outside, while the inside is more of a woven finish. it makes it a little less cozy, but the drape is great. the fit is slim across the shoulders and chest, and full everywhere else. the waist is lower in the back than the front, so it sits lower on the hip. i'm 5'4, 140, 34b, and i got a small petite, because i liked where it hit my waist better. this means i won't be wearing it without tigh
other This top is cute, light and summery. ordered a small...is a little short/boxy but otherwise fits true to size. great summer/warm weather top!
other I absolutely love this top. i am short (5'2") but curvy on the bottom with a 36dd bust. i ordered the xl, only because of my upper body. it fits great, as i don't like anything to hug my body. but it doesn't look like a tent. has a little a-line shape to it. another reason i go for the larger size is i like to dry all my clothes. ordered the grey and will order in the black, also.
other This tunic only barely resembles the photo in person.first, the color is much less saturated and more orangey than it appears in the photossecond, it's huge. i'm 5'4" and typically wear other or 4p in retailerpolgies' shirts/dresses. i ordered the sp and the dress was at least 1.other times wider than it needed to be. it hung off me completely boxy and shapeless; and the style doesn't really lend itself to use with a belt.
other Gorgeous dress and very flattering but it does run quite small in the bust (i'm 3other dd) and even the shoulder area (i rarely have problems there). i also find the side zipper a pain. sized up from a 2p to a 4p. the lace detail is especially beautiful and the color is more peachy than pink, the print quite saturated and not too pastel for early fall. i can see wearing it for 3 seasons, at least in ca.
other I expected this dress to be pretty, but was happily surprised at the level of beautiful detail. it's hard to tell in the pictures, but the dress has a black background with tan embroidery all over, and white embroidered eyelets. the full lining is bright blue and it peeks through the eyelets, with the slit on the back and the inside of the neckline lined in bright orange. the slit on the back has two buttons closing it - a really cute detail. it fit me comfortably (i am 5'7" and 130 - got the si
other I loved the print on this top in navy from the picture, and loved it even more in person. it is gorgeous, and the top feels high quality. that said, as usual with maeve clothing it fit me strangely. i am curvy with a small upper body (3other d) but larger bust, and maeve tops are almost always too tight in the bust and too flowy around the middle , which creates a pregnant look on me at least. i feel their fit model must be small busted, so for small busted ladies this top would be lovely. i always
other Beautiful skirt but does run small. i wear a small and am able to keep the skirt but have to be very careful about under garments since it is so tight. looks great though.
other If you have an hourglass figure this dress accentuates your curves. i do need to wear a tank underneath as dress is low cut.
other Great jacket for night time in the south this time of year ... very nice fabric, great classic style with a little twist... love retailerplogy ... being an older female, sometimes things can look boring ....i love to dress in fun clothes ... finding something that will work for all ages and that is a "little out side the lines " is very nice!!!!
other I love this coat. it was a great purchase and i would reccomend it to others. it looks great with layers and is comfortable for 30-50 degree temps. definitely size down when buying.
other I loved this dress before putting it on, but it was just not the right cut or style for my body type. it is very roomy and full and looked like a maternity dress which was not a look i was going for. sadly this will be going back. i loved the print and the feel of the material. just not a flattering cut for me.
other I like the retro look but these seem to run large to me.  i get they are ruched on the sides.  yet, the bottom has a saggy look.  i got the large but i feel like i should have gotten the medium to fill out the bottom. i already took the strip out and washed so i'm keeping them.  very cute with a bikini top.  maybe i just need a bigger butt.
other This dress was returned to my store and i was immediately drawn to it. i love absolutely anything with a full shape, and this dress has it! its cut like a circle...so ladies this dress has a lot of fabric. i'm 5'8 and wouldn't be able to wear it as a dress, but it made for an adorable tunic with leggings. the arms are a tad more fitted (though i have larger arms) which helped make the dress feel super cool and feminine. if you love a cool quirky piece, this one is a winner!
other I love maeve dresses and have always gotten a lot of wear out of them while still looking great. this dress does not meet those standards. on the 2nd wear of this dress the zipper completely broke. i had to take it to a dry cleaner to get replaced at a pricey cost for a pricey dress, i'm dissapointed.
other As soon as i saw this blouse in the store, i fell in love with it. i thought it was a little too expensive for what it was, but, hey, that's antho for you. i luckily had a gift card and a 15% off bday promo, so i got it at a good discount. i love the fit of it. sometimes button-down tops like this are too tight in the arms or pulls too much around the chest, and this one doesn't. when i do wear it, i have to be conscious of the buttons because it can be a little gappy in between the buttons when
other I love this cozy and comfy top. it is oversized as the name says and implies - but i normally wear an xs in most retailer tops and i chose to get a small - and i'm glad i did. it is boxy and oversized - but also short. the small is perfect for me and it really feels so cozy as is - and big enough to wear a tee or tank under it and not fee clingy.
other I love this shirt and although it is see through a tank works great under it to wear to work. the buttons on the back are sewn on really well and it comes down far enough/ is not too short. i am about 5'4" and 100 pounds. the 00 was tight on my neck so i kept a 0. otherwise the 00 would have fit fine since its a blousy shirt and would not have been too tight in the shoulders or armpits.
3 Great looking shirt that i bought for my wife, but poor quality. the fit is great but the buttons literally keep falling off. first time my wife wore it two buttons just fell off. when she was sewing them back on she showed me and another button just came off with the slightest tug. its really too bad because it looks great otherwise.
other I read the reviews prior to purchasing but loved the pattern so much i had to have it. i was not disappointed however, had i not read the reviews i would have been. it is true the top of the dress is flat and does not have the detail as shown on the model. it also appears to be disproportionate. i am 5'other and curvy the bottom fits well but the top is large however rectified by wearing a padded bra. since i ordered the petite i was surprised the dress was above the ankle (usually their items are l
3 This top looks much nicer on the model than in-person. i tried it on, it didn't look flattering and was shorter than i like. in the picture i really like the top with the design and frills on the side, gives the model a waist. in-person the design doesn't stand out much and the frills look wrinkled.it is also sweatshirt material and a tad stiff. i am sending it back. it just didn't look as flattering. also, it seemed more fitted at the top than bottom.
other This dress is just lovely--i love the pattern and the cut, and it's very comfortable to wear. i like it because i can wear it just about anywhere, and it's appropriate. you can dress it up or down. i get lots of compliments when i wear it!
other The blouse is beautiful. the quality and design are spot on. but it runs quite large. i normally wear a small or an extra small depending on the cut. i ordered this in a small based on the way it seemed to fit the model. it's huge. i'm going to have to reorder in a smaller size, but i'm not sure if the xs or xxs will fit better. i'll probably drive to my retailer store and try it on in person. for comparison, i am 116 pounds, 36-26-36.,
other Tried these on out of sheer curiosity -- i've got a long torso & was pleasantly surprised how flattering they are! they manage to look flowing & sleek without shortening the legs. took a size 6 with my 27" waist, 37" hips. it's a bit of a generous fit, especially around the waist, but they're extremely comfortable & have room to tuck tops into. i have the cowled sweater tank in gray & it looks fantastic over these! couldn't resist getting both the rust and black. perfect for a dressy casual look
other Very pretty dress! wearing it for a family beach portrait. it may run a little big but not terribly. it is also not super long as pictured. i'm 5'6 and it's perfect with a flat.
other I decided to give these trousers a try, despite my reservations about the appropriateness of the flowered embroidery on the fabric, given my age. girls and younger women can wear these types of pattern in public, but not me. for me, it seems too much like pajama wear, so wearing them as house clothing also didn't appeal to me. i'll be returning them.the length is why i took off one star. how many petites have a 31" inseam? i would need to have them hemmed. if you're looking for loose fitting,
other I grabbed this dress in green when i saw it on sale (plus there was an additional percentage off that day online) and they had my size. while it's slightly loose in the body of the dress, that will probably tighten up after the first wash since it's rayon - then it should fit like a glove. i didn't experience the zipper issue - there is a hook & eye at the top to keep the fabric together, and the zipper was stiff so it won't unzip of its own volition. it is a tad bulky at the top of the zipper w
other I bought this online to wear in my engagement photos, and its absolutely perfect! i typically wear a size l or xl and could have easily worn the l in this top, runs a tad big. keep in mind it is on the shorter side. i will be purchasing a white tank to wear underneath it.
other This dress is very comfortable, lovely, and versatile. i know i will wear this often throughout the spring and summer months because of it's elegant ease. i purchased a small and am a 34c and 28 waist; fits perfectly.
other These tanks are very soft. i have two black and one coral. i had to return the white as it was see through. they do shrink in the wash even without drying all the way and on low heat so maybe size up if you're in between sizes. i recommend these tanks for sure
other I was lucky enough to get a hold of this intarsia sweater dress after the sale and i wish i had purchased this the first time round. it is absolutely stunning, flattering, comfortable and unique! i am 5'3" and the regular hem fit me just fine at the ankles. i think this dress runs both tts to a bit large so i would size down if your small framed and stay your usual if your busty or broad shouldered. perfectly complements my taupe booties that i already owned and a my taupe maxi sweater that has
other I love the colors. however, $200 is a lot to pay for a small piece of fabric , no lining what so ever. the fabric is very thin. you will need a slip. looks just like a cover-up. going back.
other I agree a few others, it may be a little bit boxy but i don't even care because it's so beautiful! definitely a top i'm going to love long after this floral craze the fashion world is in begins to fade.
other This top is beautifully made and designed.material is soft and comfortable however it's very boxy. the details on the side stick out.i just found it not very flattering for me.
3 The sleeves are a bit too voluminous and the solid color collar stands out a bit too much.  but it's a cute pattern and style.  very comfortable.
other You have to give this dress a try - yes, it runs small - i'm usually a other in retailer dresses. / 32dd 5'5" 130lb - i couldn't button the top button with my bra on but i could without it on - it fit perfect every where else. it is very flattering in every way. it's 100% cotton, lightweight, and soft. the flare does not have too much fabric and is actually slimming unlike other fit and flare dresses. the sz 6 fit more comfortable and i could wear my bra which looked better and gave my breasts a lift
3 Why does the lining stop at mid thigh when the skirt is long? makes product look cheap while wearing. love the color, the fabric, and the fit, but cant get past this less than quality feature - will be returning.
other This dress looked great on the hanger, but once on, it did absolutely nothing for me.navy is one of my most flattering colors, but the navy in the dress did not make up for the yucky second color that was so blah it just reminded me of dirt. that second color made me look drab.i am 5'8" with a long torso and wear a size 1other in tts tops and dresses, but the waist on this dress hit at an uncomfortable spot between by waist and ribs. i really needed the waist to be dropped further. or higher
other Really cute stress! i love the pattern and feel that this dress you can easily dress up or dress down. the neckline is the main reason why i bought the dress. it is a dress that hits above my knees so i like how modest it is. the slightly open back is also a nice touch. it's a dress that can easily be dressed up or dressed down. perfect spring dress!
other I bought these in the mustard color and the salmon color.  i didn't have a problem with general fading, but used natural, mild stain remover (biokleen) and the pants were ruined. one faded where i sprayed and the other has a permanent water mark.  cold wash and line dried. such a bummer that these pants aren't every day wearable and washable!
other This cream sweater is a great addition to your wardrobe. the length hits below the waist and the zipper adds an updated touch to the look. is a bit itchy but there's room for a light layer underneath.
other True to size for petite person; bought in blue - subtle shading, looks great; paired with your blue straight leg blue "jeans"; perfect outfit for almost all occasions.
other I love this unique piece. it is slightly over sized which is intended - cinches allow you to tighten the waist area/providing more definition. will look great with booties in the fall.. great boho dress.. the included slip runs small and short. however, if it's a piece you love, you could easily wear a different slip if you wanted something a little longer.
3 I wanted to love this dress because the fit is so flattering and the color is so great however i could not get the button along my bust to lay flat. normally this can happen if the fit is too tight around the bust but i promise there was still plenty of room. the fabric just bent in a way that left a gaping hole at my bust. unfortunately it's going to have to go back.
3 I really liked this tshirt but unfortunately the v-neck is just too low for my taste. it fits really loose and even buying the xxs i just felt it would stretch out and be even bigger. really cute style just not sure it's worth the price. great colors though.
other I ordered this dress online and didn't really know what to expect. but to my surprise, it's exactly what i had hoped it would be. the dress is a fantastic fit and has a modern, interesting print. the fabric does seem thin for the price. but i am not returning it. it's a casual summer dress that kicks up my look a notch on weekends. i wear it with beige sandals, and the gray and beige look good together too.
other I ordered the orange version in size xl. it fits true to size. the fit on me matches the online photos. it's so comfortable to wear. i love the unique details of it. i've washed & air-dried it too. it retained its size. the color is outstanding. it's such a pretty shade that looks more red online than it does in person. there's more of a darker orange tint to it. i've gotten a lot of use out of this tee. hopefully it'll come back in the fall in more colors.
3 I agree with the first reviewer. this dress is just ok; nothing to write home about. if you need a throw on dress in a pinch, it's nice to have on hand, but there are probably a lot of other retailer dresses that fit the bill that are better quality than this one. it is also very body conscious in the back. the material is a thin, ribbed rayon - on the cheap side. overall, it's a comfortable piece, but it's more like a thin, long-sleeve t-shirt, rather than a quality dress. it would have been a gr
other It's amazing!i did size down on this one, but i didn't have to. that depends on the kind of fit you are looking for. sizing down did make the shirt more form fitting in my chest area, but also did make the garment somewhat less comfortable in the armpit area for being tighter (but not too tight). my normal size would have alleviated this problem, but also would have left the shirt with not a whole lot of shape. i opted to have a little shape and deal with the fabric slightly digging into my
other I bought this sweater for my future daughter-in-law for her birthday in coral. she lover it! the contrast of color in the yarn is hard to see in the photos. grey and bright coral, just beautiful!
other This is a wonderful top! the fabric is soft and comfortable, with a beautiful drape. the pattern is very pretty, the curved hems are very flattering, and the top is versatile. it can be worn with shorts, as shown, or a skirt with a belt or pants. i have pilcro wide leg pants in orange, yellow and green, and this top looked amazing with all of them. a great little find!
other I love the way this dress moves on you and the high low. a medium fit me perfectly. i am 5'8" and the long part in the back barely touches the floor in flat shoes. the colors are sort of fall, but the top is like a sun dress. i think you could wear this any time of year with the appropriate accessories. i wore it with a 3/other length sleeved cardigan and sandals in oct. and it was perfect. the fabric feels nice, great quality. it's on sale so you have nothing to loose!
3 I did like this dress. it has a good simple shape, and is very comfortable. however, it's plain, and for the price and it being dry clean only, i'll wait to see if it'll go on sale. it's also worth noting that i'm 5'2" and was uncomfortable with the length of the petite, but the regular size was a good length (right at the knees).
3 Cute shirt but not worth the price. i did purchase it at 20% off but would have waited for a better sale. the yellow is a nice fall color
other This is such a great work wear piece for me. it's form flattering, well constructed, comfortable and truly elegant. this is probably my 5th or 6th dress from the moulinette soeurs line and i am consistently impressed with the quality and wearability of these clothes.5'7" 127lbs 34b wearing a size 4
other This looks sooooo much better on, than on the hanger/in the picture. i bought the grey, and it is the most comfortable tunic i've ever worn. it is light, airy, and so easy to wear. i wish it came in more prints/colors, cause i'd buy another one, in a skinny minute! if you don't try this on, you're missing out on a surprisingly awesome wardrobe piece. you can wear it year-round with jeans, pants, a vest, wrap, scarves, leggings, boots, sandals or anything else, and it looks chic and whimsical. go
other I took these out of the package and wanted them to fit so badly, but i could tell before i put them on that they wouldn't. these are for an hour-glass figure. i am more straight up and down. the waist was way too small for my body shape and even if i sized up, i could tell they would still be tight in the waist and too roomy in the hips - for me. that said, they are really nice. sturdy, linen-like fabric, pretty color, well made. i hope they make someone very happy!
other The fit and style of this dress are beautiful. it's a bouncy fabric that is light and comfortable. i really wanted to love it, but the color just didn't work for me. the pictures make it look like it's a nice cream color, but it's very tan and i can't pull it off with my coloring.
other These are the same in sizing as the hyphen chinos, but these are far more versatile. i love the boyfriend look of the hyphens, but the stet chino can be dressed up or down. they are so comfortable and the fit is wonderful. i'm 5'8" 138 lbs, and i took my usual size 28 in these. i have full thighs, and i didn't find these to be too tight in the legs at all, but i only tried on the black/charcoal.
other I have bought several tees by t.la and this one is really cute. i bought it in the blue stripe size xs. it runs slightly larger than most in that size, but it will probably shrink a little. it's not overly baggy, just comfy fit. i like the colors in this top and will wear it often with shorts or jeans. the fabric is thin so i'm not sure how long it will last, but until then it will be a keeper in my closet!
other This dress is to die for. it's exactly as pictured, beautiful quality and extremely flattering. all the lace and lining make it a slightly heavier dress - i can imagine it getting really warm after a while in the summer sun. but it would absolutely be worth the bit of sweat to wear this gorgeous dress.
other I tried this tunic at a store and loved it. i had to buy a much bigger size because the sleeves are so narrow.the 1other fit ok but the sleeves are so tight it hurt. i have normal arms and i am so glad i was at a store to try a bigger size.
other Comfortable and warm. i will wear this a lot this winter.
other Great quality, flattering cut- could even be used as a little day dress for warm weather! love the detail of the buttons on the back and the delicacy of the straps.
other I've been shopping with retailer over 10 years and this is my first review. i almost didn't order after reading negative reviews from petite ladies. i'm 5' 2" and these jeans are perfection! they look amazing with a 2-3 inch heel. i don't think they are meant to wear with flats since petite people look ridiculous in flats with boot cut or wide leg anyway. love these!
other Beautiful medium weight duster; it looks just like on line photos!my store did not have this duster so i ordered on line. i usually wear a medium top, but sometimes a large.i'm 5'7", 140 lbs, and i don't like my tops tight.i ordered this duster in xl because i like room in my cardigans; i could have gone with a large.i have to roll up the cuffs of the sleeves, but i like to do that anyway.this sweater duster is soooo soft and warm! so comfy! very stretchy with no closures on the front.
other I had really high hopes for this shirt after reading the reviews. first off it runs really small. i usually wear a small or medium ( other or 6) i couldn't even get the 6 on. i probably could have even done a 10. the fabric was extremely flimsy. i was almost afraid i was going to rip it taking it off. other than the sizing and the fabric, it just wasn't flattering on me.
other I love this dress. i think it will be awesome to wear this summer but also a great transition piece into fall. very boho!
3 This sweater has potential, but it wasn't right for me. the collar isn't flattering on me...too thick, and my shoulders are already broad. my waist is high, so i need a longer look. the color is true to size, but it's s little see through...dark bra shows through.
other I have four kids and a post baby bump that wants to live on forever, so i'm a huge fan of flowy tops--this one looked cute online, but i wasn't sold on it and passed. then i went to the store the next day and saw it, and the colors were more vibrant, so i thought, why not try it on, though i wasn't that excited about it. i tried it on and it was like the shirt was having her cinderalla moment--totally transformed how it looked on me and in person. i love it! it was one of those instant "i'm buyi
other Layered this with a chunky sweater and a pair of kicks. it can be low key or dressed up with a pair of heels, multi-functionality not just occasional. it&#39;s feminine, funky, and fabulous!! i bought the last one in the store!
other Love this jacket. it's soft and a beautiful shade of ivory. perfect for casual wear with a pair of black jeans, while still maintaining an elegant look.
other I have been staring at these shorts since they first appeared and finally decided to treat myself to them for my birthday. when they came in the mail i was so excited and they in person are even more beautiful and well made then in the picture. but be warned these shorts are rather short so if you don't mind showing a bit of leg these will be right up your alley.
other I'm 5'4, 11other and the xs swallowed me like a snuggie. i suppose the tons of fabric might drape nicely if you're 5'8 and above? it drooped and hung comically large from every angle under arm, body and skirt. a belt was no match for that much fabric. the colors are gorgeous and it appeared well made, but the design was awful.
other I couldn't wait to get this dress! i bought it and was instantly disappointed when i took it out of the bag. while the fabric was beautiful, the sizing was way off. this dress claims to be 35" long, and i could tell instantly it wasn't. it barely covered my rear. i also know it's supposed to be flowy, but it was really, really wide. i can see this working for someone around other feet tall who is wider.
other I love this tank top...the fringe on the bottom is fun, and i've gotten many compliments on it already...i think it runs true to size :-)
other I love these, but i should have ordered the size 2other instead of my usual 26. i can wear them higher with a tight belt, but they are still too long. too cute to return though.
other I loved the design and light weight quality. reference i'm 5'4, 125..i ordered a small, it's a tad big but i can handle it. because of the neck line, you must wear a strapless bra.
3 This immediately caught my eye in the neutral pattern, and the fabric is actually quite nice. the fit is at least a size or two too large though, with the bust being way too large for me even sizing down. my normal other was big everywhere, and the other was still big in the chest, but fit everywhere else. the belt is handy for cinching in some of the loose areas, but the top section just didn't work for me. maybe better for someone better endowed?
other I bought this top in both colors. the fit is perfect, the styling is very cute and it also is very comfortable!!the only bad thing is that it snags on my jewelry !! :(. if it weren't for that i would rate it a 5!!
other This dress is very comfortable and casual, but in a high quality fabric that makes it great for a summer dinner with dressy sandals. i don't think a bra can be worn with it which i don't mind at all but might be a problem for others.
other Love this jacket. it fits very well and is super comfortable. you can wear it to work or on the weekends. super versatile!
other I am in love with this top! i saw it online, and i was a bit nervous to order it because it's a little pricy for a tank top, and i was worried it was going to be too short on me. i was so wrong! the detail on the top is so beautiful, and looks even better in person! it hit me right at mid hip, and looks so cute with jeans and sandals. i sometimes get frustrated with the cut of the arms with retailer clothes because they are cut so low that you see your bra when you lift your arms, but this top is
other I was considering this online for days before a ladies lunch date meandered into a brick & mortar location. i had been thinking of sizing up, if i ordered online, just to be sure it wouldn't be too tight or awkward, and when i had looked for it in stores nearby, it was out of stock, but i hadn't thought to look for my tts, which happened to be available in the store where i went. i tried it on, because i was so curious, and it worked!! i love it. it is so easy-breezy. it will be perfect to layer
other Beautiful pink top.  comfortable, love the color and print , style and sleeves.  good quality.  didn't have the issues with the placement of the bees over my breasts that other reviewers did. the bees were at the sides of my breasts. covered my butt for the most part in jeans. flattering cut.  i got an xs (5'2", 34b, 115#).
other I get so many compliments when i wear this... colors are great and print is unique. perfect for fall.
other This dress is beautiful. it has lovely colors that should compliment many skin types. i bought the dress for my daughter as a graduation gift. i have not given it to her yet so i don't know if it fits or how it fits.
other This dress looks like it could be cute on but when you put it on its just blah. i saw someone else trying it on in the fitting room and she felt the same. not cute, not flattering, the model photo is deceiving. would not recommend, although it looks airy and comfy.
other Unusual design and striking color make this the perfect dress this winter season. the fit is flattering and the design makes it perfect for work or play.
other This top is gorgeous dress it up for work or wear with jeans for a more casual look. the top fits true to size and the lace is not overdone . i would recommend this and can't wait to wear it.
other Loved this cute dress. so easy and simple to wear. i wore it with tan/nude sandals to keep it casual for the race track in saratoga. so comfortable. for this price it is a must have.
other Beautiful colors. lovely style. feminine and has a nice flow. fiattering fit in back also. nice holiday blouse. really very pretty.
other This dress fits perfectly. the cut is so flattering. i am tall but the length is great. not too short.
other I disagree with a previous review saying that this top is unflattering and boxy. i bought this top and it actually looks just like the image in the photo online. i received a lot of compliments when i wore it. i wore it with black skinny jeans, black tall boots and a short sleeve cardigan which i used as a jacket, and did not keep on the entire night. i think the shirt even looks good without being tucked in. :) i really love it. maybe just wish i could button the top from time to time to change
other I like this shirt and think its very feminine.
other Bought this as "transitional" wear post baby #other & i love them! will probably end up wearing them all winter long! i love that i'm 6 foot & they still are scrunchy at the bottom which i honestly wasn't expecting.
other I purchased this shirt in white and black. the white is more ivory-isn, and is a bit thin/see through. the shirts can be worn with jeans, or dressed up with a skirt. i just wish it was a little more form fitting. i do like the hint of stretch in the fabric! very comfortable as well!
other Like the look of this tank, ran a bit larger than expected at the neck but overall happy with the purchase
other I'm 5'3" about 130lbs and ordered a size 6. the print on the fabric is as expected but the shape of the dress and fit were not good at all. i probably would wear a other instead of the 6, but could tell that even if i had the 4, the cut of it still wouldn't be flattering on me at all. it was baggy in odd places and had no shape. the outer fabric is very sheer and see through and the lining is nice, with a fitted slip design.
other I love this dress. even more beautiful in person ??
other I ordered these culottes because they looked comfortable yet elegant. they are indeed both!
other Love love love this jumpsuit. i can't wait to wear it in the tx summer. it is super fun and elegant. you can dress it up or keep it casual. i am 5'9 15other and wear a 10. it laying quite nicely and doesn't require you to wear heels with it.
other I love the print of this dress; the deep blue really is striking. i agree with the other reviewers that it has no lining and therefore, it's hard to justify the price. i can't seem to part with it yet due to the lovely print and the off the shoulder style is romantic and flattering. still on the fence. . . it would be better as a sale piece.
other Based on the reviews of others, i ordered this dress a size larger than i usually wear and it fits perfect. i am an 8, so i got this in a 10. this is the perfect casual dress for pretty much anytime of the year -can be worn with sandals in the spring and summer, or boots in the winter.
other This is a great dress for all body types. the fabric is substantial and soft.  i sized down for a closer fit, but i could have also bought my usual medium and had the extra space to belt it and wear a looser fit. i busted out the boots, a little early, and the outfit was done.  super easy to wear, dressed up or dressed down.  totally worth the price, i'm glad i didn't wait until it went on sale for fear of selling out.
other These are my new favorite leggings. they have everything i need - soft waist band that doesn't squeeze me at all, not overly long, subtle ribbed texture (black pair) that make them feel just a little nicer, and most importantly they are not see thru at all. so soft on the inside too. and this price is nuts too, i'm so happy with these!
other I'm glad i bought this dress with a discount. it's a comfortable staple, but not a showstopper. i love the plush fabric, which has great weight, and the skirt. the top is cut to be a little revealing, which worked well with my full bust but wouldn't be work appropriate. the keyhole at the back is large, but did not reveal my bra.
other This sweater is the kind of find i hope for when i browse the retailer website or walk into the store. i tried two sizes -- i sometimes wear an s and sometimes an xs these days -- and after trying them both i felt that with this sweater it was better to err on the side of snugness. the hooks and eyes pull a bit, but i won't be fastening this all the way to the top. the smaller size works better to hug my waist before the peplum flares out. the color is a dreamy pinky nude (more pink than nude), an
other I really love this rose-pink color. the pants fit like a glove. the cuff is not sewn up, so you can lower the cuff to where you like it.
other This is one great button up shirt ! the fringe hem is a fun little detail that gives this shirt some serious versatility. it looks great layered under jackets and sweaters, with a came underneath, or all on its own. the fabric could be a bit thicker. i am between a small and a medium ( a 6 or an 8), and bought this in a small.
other This is a great fall shirt. great for dressing up casual wear!!!
other This dress is even more amazing in person. the beading and embroidery are quite intricate and add a touch of elegance. the kimono like sleeves have the same details - especially nice for toasting!be aware that the dress is not mid calf but just below the knee- a surprise but still quite lovely. the lines of the dress and exceptional detailing should make this dress a timeless classic. i look forward to wearing it to many occasions when a lbd would be just too expected!
3 I liked the colors and the design but it's kind of an odd fabric, no give at all and no drape. stiff and kind of structured feeling for a casual cardigan. the sleeves are extremely narrow and tight. i ordered a medium and it felt like a ace bandage squeezing my arms. my arms are normal sized. if you have exceptionally narrow arms, might work for you. sending it back.
other I think these look great. i found them on the sale rack and at $50 w/ 40% off, it's a pretty great deal. i plan on wearing with low heels. hope they work out. i will show to boyfriend, get his feedback too.
3 Gorgeous design, but it was just so heavy. i felt overwhelmed by the amount of fabric, although this is my fault for thinking i could get by in regular sizing as petite was sold out. will be returning
other This is the perfect jacket to throw on for errands around town. picture doesn't do it justice...very unique and stylish. love the three-quarter sleeves for this time of year.
other Love this top so much. it's very unique and one of those tops that's "effortless" to wear. i was expecting it to be boxy because of what other reviewers had written, but i find it to be flattering and comfortable. i'm glad i ordered the small because i do think the medium (my usual size) would have been too big.
3 The snake and the studs, they make the dress. sadly, the snake is hard to find, as mentioned in another review. this dress also runs large, i'm usually a 1other and went down to 10. the images are misleading too. two pics show a small, fitted look, and the other two show a full, swing look. i'm trying to make this work but it may have to go.
other Luckily i bought this on sale... i now see the instructions online say to hand wash, but i bought mine in the store. the instructions on the tag said to wash delicate in cold water and tumble dry. i washed it in cold water and it shrunk to doll size.
other The melon color is soft and flattering. it is a little on the long side in the back, but i paired it with a lightweight, flowy sweater, and received compliments.
other Very soft, comfy, lightweight sweater. perfect for layering as the weather gets cooler. looks great with jeans or jean shorts.
other Everyone should have this blouse, amazing! simply love it! it does run large, so purchase down 1-other sizes.
other I love this shirt! it fits great and looks awesome with shorts or skinny jeans. i love the beads on the shoulders. i liked it so much that i ordered it in other colors.
other I got the small petite and this fits beautifully, as on the model (i am 5'2"). i do think that it flatters a flat belly more than it would flatter a fatter one! it would certainly hide any belly, but the drape works best if you're streamlined, i imagine. if you've got a tapering torso, go for it! depending on your bust, you may want to pin the overlapped fabric just to be sure of hiding the bottom of your bra. not that i've found it a problem.
other I really like this skirt - so colorful! the interesting pattern and multiple colors will make this a great fall skirt. i can wear it with pink, burgundy, gray, white, black, and probably many more. can't wait for the temps to drop!
other I love this top. i got a medium in black on sale. i am 5'8'' and 135lbs. the medium fits great. the medium is slightly loose on me through the tummy, which is nice - in my experience, it is not too constraining, contrary to other reviews. however, i think it depends on your body shape; i am a coke-bottle. this will be a wardrobe staple for day to day and going out; note, it is too low-cut for work wear. very happy with my purchase.
other Love this - bought in camel and cream in xs. runs large. cute with jeans & thigh high boots, leather skirt and booties or just casual. so many compliments... great for wearing a sweater but showing off arms....
other I loved the idea of these pants as i've been looking for an updated pair of tuxedo pants. i wear 26 in most of my jeans. i'm not super skinny & consider my legs medium (not too skinny & not too athletic). i tried these on in xs (36 european as marked on them) & they were big around the waist & hip area. there was so much gap in the back which made them look frumpy! i did however liked the length. the fabric is nice & heavy which i also loved. sadly, these didn't work for me though. really wish t
other Saw this top online and hoped for the best. my hopes were rewarded! lovely lightweight summery top but i think with a cardigan it could be worn in the fall also. i asked other friends if they liked it and they all agreed it was very flattering so i decided it was a keeper. have worn it three times since purchasing and have received lots of compliments.
other Soft and unique. love the sleeves. my usual size medium fits perfectly. per the other reviewer, i guess my bust is large enough for the flowers to be on the side and not directly on breasts! my only wish is that it has some embroidery on it....love!!
other I love this shirt. i have it in red. i found the fit tts and looks great casually with a scarf or dressed up with a nice necklace. you can't go wrong with a cute shirt that is soft. i like the length goes just past my bottom in the back but not overwhelming.
other Even more beautiful in person. runs large as i'm usually a medium and bought a small. great for summer/fall transition.
3 Runs a size big unless you want it really boxy. felt the matl was flimsy and would prob pill soon. turquoise was a pretty color but returning this one.
other The design is so cute (people in different yoga poses, small and subtle prints) and a must for a yogini. i love the colors, it's colorful but not too bright and it's beautiful against the white background. i ordered xs (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips) and it fit perfectly (it has a fitted look but not tight because it has some stretch from the soft cotton material). i like the fact that there's no stretchy spandex feel, just pure soft cotton feel. it's great for gals who are conscious about the arms
other Lovely crochet lace tunic. also very comfortable. doesn't wrinkle and the cotton has a lovely feel.
other I wish this shirt would not have had so much material. it would make a great maternity top! if you are really thin, it might work for you too.
other I bought the tangerine version of this dress for my brother's summer wedding in the south, and i can't wait to wear it. cotton material has a touch almost like linen, but not rough. nice and hearty fabric. tangerine color is beautiful, more salmon than coral. wearing it with a little shoulder shrug and the laika inca shoes?the shoes aren't on the retailer site anymore, but i found them at my local store. just perfect.
other I adore this dress. it has a fairly thick material, which helps the skirt stay full and is very flattering if, like me, your thighs or tummy can be a problem area in dresses! the only downside for me is the fact that i have fairly narrow shoulders, so the seam for the sleeves tends to stick out a bit! i get lots of compliments on this one!
other I am petite, 5'2, and i ordered the xxsp, i think it is so adorable on and looks great with skinny/slim pants or leggings. i do not think it runs that large, it is suppose to be loose and flowy and it looks on me exactly how it looks on the model. i got the gray print and it is quite pretty.
3 I was really excited to see what this looked like in person. when i unpacked this shirt i was shocked to see what how short it looked. the colors are very close to what you see online but the shirt is super boxy. i have a smaller torso and it barely came to below my waist. you can't tell by the picture but this shirt can fit at least other people in the width. when i tried it on, it didn't look as boxy but still a really weird cut! it was disappointing because it looks so cute online! i will be retu
other I love these. i like that they're fancier than your basic summer shorts but they still look casual and effortless. unlike the other reviews i found that they run large. i'm usually a 4, maybe a 6, and the other is roomy.  still looks good though just rides a bit lower on my hips.
other These pants are gorgeous when you first see them. they fit beautifully when you first put them on. and then you wear them for one day. and they snag. on everything. and little strings start to come out of the pants. and the hem begins to unravel. and the pants which were once beautiful light summer pants appropriate for work or brunch are now frumpy, worn out pants with a million snags and strings hanging off of them .... after one day. i can't begin to tell you how annoyed i am that i spent
other I passed this sweater a few times during a recent visit to retailer. after striking out on several items i thought would work, i grabbed this sweater in the cream color. i loved it as soon as i put it on! it is meant to be oversized, which i love. the neck is chunky and looks good open or buttoned all the way to make a loose turtleneck. looks great with skinny jeans and booties. i went with my usual xs. great purchase!
other I love this and instantly felt sexier when i put it on, yet with the longer sleeves and looseness felt i could wear it casually. i will say that i have to often keep adjusting/pulling the top neckline down. it seems to want to revert to above-the-shoulders position. the fabric and quality feels nice and it was a great purchase for me!
other Another lovely, billowy top. i tried on the xsp and the bottom was just huge. and i have a huge bottom - haha! it flowed out so far in the back that it looked silly. it's too bad, because from the waist up, it looks great!
other Love this top...bought in other colors...white and the orange. fun change to regular t-shirts....sized down because its flowy.
other Purchased the xs blue. love the fit and light material. perfect casual tee for warm weather. no shrinkage after washing in cold water and minimal wrinkles when hung immediately.
other I ordered a size smaller prr other reviewers but that still didn't prepare me for the sweater's issues. it looks really cute but the quality is pretty horrendous. i wore it for the first time today and already the sweater is pilling a lot on my back. seriously heartbroken.
other Size down! i love this item. it goes perfect with leggings but if you are typically a small you would need to order an extra small and so forth. hopefully once i wash this it will shrink some.
other Love this top, just received it today.it is a very artistic interpretation for a casual top.the blue is gorgeous!the unique style of the peplm and the details on the front set this apart!runs a little shorter, but i feel the length enhances it;s beauty, and is appropriate for the overall design.love !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ordered my usual size and it fits perfectly.
other Wonderfully soft fabric and gorgeous pattern. the background color is a more standard gray than shows in the on-line photo (which looks more pinkish gray on my screen), but it's just lovely -- looks perfect with jeans or a skirt. i will be wearing this a lot this fall, and will keep a lookout for additional patterns!
other I love this jumpsuit.i would like to first say that, while a gorgeous model, i actually think this piece looks even better on different body shapes! sizing i love the shape, the style, and the comfort. i tried it on in a dressing room where it turns out another woman was trying it as well. i am 5'5" and usually wear a other or 6 and got the small. she was a bit shorter and pettte and it looked fabulous on her! it is loose all over, and so flow and fabulous. it hits me where it hits the mod
other I love wide-leg pants and i'm so glad they're back. i bought this pair in the navy and cream colors as soon as i saw them online. i bought my usual size 28 in retailer and they fit just fine. the navy color is more like a dark blue but still perfect for spring/summer. comfortable material and overall good quality. i just wish they came in more colors.
3 I only gave this three stars due more to personal preference than to any real flaws with the product. it is very comfortable and for a jersey-style shirt quite warm. but that is one of my issues with the shirt. i wanted to wear it well into spring and i think it'll be just too warm. (i live in the northeast) i also felt that while it fit tts it had a more generous fit than what i expected, which was another negative for me. i wanted it to be more fitted to my body. however, i did keep it because
other All the positive reviews are right - the shirt is great! something not entirely obvious from the online photos is that there is a slit on both sides of the shirt. makes it even more comfortable and flattering. i wasn't sure how i was going to style this for the winter before i received it but as soon as i put it on i had plenty of ideas. it looks particularly great with a chunky scarf, leggings, and boots. it looked great with a close fitting turtleneck underneath. it really can be dressed up or
other I absolutely love mother jeans, but i unfortunately had to return these ones. this particular style seemed to run pretty small. too, i always size up in white jeans, and even the size up that i had ordered were just too tight. i typically wear a 28 in mother, and ordered a 29 in these.
other I have worn this dress with a jean jacket, birkenstocks or a dressier wedged sandal. it washes beautifully and is super soft. would buy in different colors if there were more options. looks better in person.
other Beautiful sweater. i first bought it in black and loved it so much i bought it in burgundy. the burgundy one is longer and slightly bigger than the black one and they are both smalls. nice thing is i can wear the burgundy one with leggings. love the lace on the sleeves and the sweater is a nice weight.
3 This runs really big. i usually wear s or m so i got a small but i need the xs in this top and it is sold out. i don't have a store close by (about an hour away) and i hate paying shipping for returns! i will either have to plan a trip to the store or try to exchange for size over the phone. i debated keeping the small but it is really too big .... i love the style though!
other Beautiful tee and cut with a classic, simple silhouette. nice weight and true to size. i'm 5'7", 132# and the small fits me like i like. not tight at all, with room to allow for shrinkage. i really appreciate the higher cut of the neck as most tees i have purchased last several years i love for the overall fit and material but am a little self-conscious in due to the low cut neck. maybe if i weren't as small chested this wouldn't be an issue for me. i definitely recommend this tee.
other Very comfortable,  looks great on. like the color & fabric. something you can throw on & go
3 While the styling is cute, the fit was poor under the arms and there was quite a gap. i returned this.
other Great swimsuit, love the fabric and pattern. the top lacks support.
other I wanted to love this dress, it looks beautiful on the model but it isn't the flattering, even on sale i am not sure if it would be worth it, it it runs pretty big.
other This top is so much prettier on. you can dress it up or down. it does run a tad large. i'm 5'7" and 14other lbs. i am usually in between a small and medium but usually a medium. i went for the small on this and i loved the fit of it. still pretty flowy and the medium would have been just too big. it is a tunic so it runs kind of long. a tiny bit too long for me but i will still wear it a lot.
other Very pretty dress, the blue is a little lighter than navy but is still really nice. the embroidered flowers are lovely as well. the a-line cut is very flattering on. i can't wait to wear this dress this spring!
3 I love the look of this sweater and was so happy with how it looked and felt when i first tried it on, but within a day of wear, i noticed significant pilling, which made it appear much older / worn.
other Beautiful top!  had trouble with the buttons but i just slipped it over my head to avoid trying to get the buttons loose.  it will look great with dark jeans and mules!
other The skirt is comfortable and as pictured. it also ran tts. i'm 5'5" tall and weigh 140 lbs. i had the medium and didn't need to size up to a large. when you put the skirt on a normal body, it looks like you are wearing an easter egg... and not in a good way.
other This top is perfectly feminine. the fabric is light and the bow adds that perfect touch of distinction.
3 I'm a size 28 jeans 5'9 with a bubble bottom. these were falling off of me around the hips. these are warm. i was expecting them to not be sheer since they are fleece lined but when i sat down i was shocked to notice it. it doesn't matter functionality wise because i never felt a "draft." they look good and are well made but i will be returning due to the lack of fit.
other Byron lars knows how to make you look like a woman with his magical dresses!  i decided to get the navy (i also own the sold-out marguerite aka carissima in bronze) instead of the black or white since everyone and their mother owns it already.  the lace of the top is different--more delicate but less intricate.  it's still very beautiful.    my body type is inverted and the dress is hourglass, so the size 8p fits great on top but loose on my hips and rear.  i'm going to keep this dress and do mo
other Blue jeans that fit like a dream & they were on sale.
other This jacket is just too small for me anyway and i am no way big. i am tall and athletic and this thing looked like it had shrunk in the wash. there are so many better fitting other types out there, this went back
other This is a great sweater. soft and beautiful. it's my new go to sweater??
other I got this in the brown and absolutely love it. this is perfect for cool weather. i'm super particular about fabric quality and this cardigan does not disappoint
other I absolutely adore this top! it is so versatile and looks equally beautiful with jeans as with dressier, skinny pants. i bought this to wear for our holiday photos and have gotten so much use out of it. worth every penny. i have just ordered the blue version and cannot wait to get it.
other I found this top to be very beautiful and well made.the fabric is on the lighter side, however for me that is a double plus.it is great for layering with a cami underneath and/or a heavier sweater on top.and going towards spring it extends wearing time.the lace on the sleeves is beautiful and a pretty peek a boo effect if layered under another sweater.it 's a subtle sexy top with endless possibilities.i found it runs very true to size.i purchased the aqua and after receiving it i rushed t
other I just purchased this blouse in store! the fabric has a nice weight and drape, feels nice to the touch and is opaque. i'll be wearing this one as a dress and a top. i'm 5'2" and this fell a couple inches above my knee. i typically wear an xs at retailer and opted to go with a small for the extra length and because i hate when off the shoulder silhouettes pop up and become not so off the shoulder. i laid the xs and small out to compare sizing and didn't notice a major  difference width wise. i typi
other I got this shirt in light blue. i absolutely love it. i just bought it for the summer and i wore it on a day where it was 8other and it was just perfect. it is a very light material and it's very flowy so it breathes very well. i got an xs. i am 5'6 and it fits just perfectly. highly recommend!
other I ordered this in the neutral motif and the colors and design are more beautiful in person. unfortunately, there were no "petites" available when i ordered so i will have to have the length and slit tailored.
other Love this skirt! i enjoy being trendy, but i love the retro vibe. can be dressed up, or worn to work.
other The dress didn't meet my expectations, specifically the color, the texture, and the cut of the dress. although the dress was very well made, it just wasn't right for me.
3 So comfortable and soft but starting pilling after one wear! sending back.
other Liked everything about these but they should say in the description that they're ribbed.
other I think i've made a hobby out of trying on jumpsuits & rompers this season. i now own three (including this one in my usual size small: 32d-31-38). i passed right by this on-line but it drew my attention in the store. i didn't realize it was chocolate brown and ivory (i'm a sucker for brown). i tried it on on a whim and it looked great. i am tall--almost 5' 9" and it looked great. i will say it shows off my bottom (for better or worse) more than other jumpsuits. it doesn't give me a wedgie but a
other I love this dress but the zipper is definitely defective.its a flatering style and i love the fabric and fit. im normally a 10 but the 8 fit perfectly. i'm nervous to wear it because of the zipper. i would return it but dont have the receipt.
other I love the asymmetrical style of this dress - so unique. also the cotton blend is appreciated in a sea of polyester. the body of the dress hangs nicely and is flattering to the figure. but it didn't quite work for me due to the sleeves- they are narrow and not stretchy enough to be comfortable. sizing up may have helped, but because i am also short (5'1"), the sleeves were also too long for me. i wish it came in petite length. if so, i could probably just go up a size to make the sleeves more co
other I'm not sure why they call this "black" because what you see in this pictures depicted is pretty much the shade in person. the fabric itself is lovely. it made my wider hips look smaller! :)___________pros:- drapes beautifully on the body, especially for curvier gals.- not black but a deep navy/velvet look and feel.- very forgiving and stretchy.- perfect length in front and back.- hides imperfections wonderfully.- soft, flows well, and unique!cons:- material is thin, not for winter a
other I was looking for a dress that would make me feel as special as i would feel when i attend my daughter's baby shower. this design, featuring a variety of spring influenced flower motifs embossed upon an eyelet fabric, was exactly what my mind's eye envisioned! the use of the solid colored shirtdress button line and cuffs softly pulled all the elements of this unique work beautifully together. i found the fit to be almost costumed made for my figure. the number of compliments i received on the da
other Love this top! with swing/loose tops, i always size down. i'm 5'1", 115, 34b, and took a 0. it fit very well, i tried a other on as well and i could see what the other reviewers were saying about the top part not laying flat. so size down if you can! i got white so i use a nude bandeau bra with it, works well!
other I think these are a cute pant. they run large in the waist/seat area but not in the length. i'm 5'other and this gathered at my ankle. i like them even though i have to keep hoisting them up. keep in mind the tie to tighten the waist does not stay
other These are such under-rated pants! i love the fit, style, fabric & everything about them. they are the perfect weight & can be worn with boots, sandals, flats, etc. they run tts - i got my usual 26. get yourself a pair while they last. you won't regret it.
other I love these jeans. the wash is nice enough for work. they fit well around the waist and have just the right mid-rise height, to make them stylish- not mom jeans at all. i am a pilcro convert. very comfortable too.
other The only critique i have of this is that the zipper gets stuck at the waistband every time i try to zip it up (even when it's not on me - just trying to hang it up) the fabric is strange but really cool, and the fit is nice, although a little tiny bit big on me. i am 5'5" with a 27" waist and i got a size 2. the pockets are awesome!
other I am other 6' and 130 pounds and ordered this in an xs. the sweater is enormous. the material is also scratchy and not soft at all. i'm disappointed with retailer's sizing this year. i've had to return a # of xs items because they are huge. really disappointing.
other This is a very sexy skirt. very slimming...a great basic long skirt to have in your wardrobe. dress it up or down.the slits are high, so you are exposed like a short shirt.
other Cute embroidered mixed textiled shirt. super comfy maybe runs a little small across chest but has a nice stretch so it accommodates well. a great transition piece.
3 I really wanted to love this everything about this piece. especially after reading all of the great review i was so excited and looking forward to getting this dress. unfortunately it just did not work out. i ordered a large and it fit fine but the dress did not give me the faltering shape i had read about and was hoping for. it literally just hung on me and made me look wider. sadly i had to return this.
other Im normally an xs and i bought size other and it fit great. very slimming and looks great with white capris.
other Just bought this in the store a couple days ago and wore it for the first time today. love the embroidery detail and i feel that the colors are more vibrant in person. i typically wear a other in most retailer tops but i got a 0 in this and it is great - seems to be a generous fit. the slits on the sides do come up a bit high, but i wore a cami underneath since it is sheer and the slits were not an issue with it. looks great with jeans. it is a great transitional piece for the fall as i'm sure i will
other So gorgeous! the details make this tank so special! the subtle sequin around the neckline are just enough to make this a dress-up or dress-down top. perfect with skinny jeans for an evening date night or a black cardigan for the office. the fabric is soft -- almost like a very light weight knit sweater, but so light that you can wear it for summer.
other This dress is just what i was looking for. i ordered it in late summer. it was back ordered and i ended up wearing it on thanksgiving day! it's so comfortable, and just the right length. i wore it with leggings and boots, but it will be just as great with sandals in the spring.
other I absolutely loved the patterns and colors of this skirt, if only the cut wasn't so odd. the sides of the skirt "wing out" for a very distracting and unflattering look. the stiff, felt-like quality of the material only makes matters worse. in that respect, the model photos are not at all accurate. it also runs large. i had to go down one full size.
other Love it to layer. it is not heavy the perfect weight & soft material. my daughters all want to steal it!
other This skirt fits amazing. i run between a s and m in bottoms and went with the s. there is a little give in the fabric which is always a plus. this will surely become a staple in my wardrobe.
3 Really wanted to love dress but something was off with fit. fabric is lovely and zipper detail nice unfortunately style was not for me.
other I really love this addition to my wardrobe. the colors are great and it is very comfortable. my only complaint is that it runs large. it would be nice if they had more than two sizes.
other This is the most flattering dress i have bought in years. the fact that it's machine washable was a huge plus. fabric is so comfortable and the length is perfect! i wear either m or l and went with the large for a little extra room, but either would have fit well.
3 Cute dress- flattering and seems to be well made. however, when i received it it seemed that it had been worn. the bottom was all dirty and it had a white mark at the top. called and rep said they would send new dress if i send first back, so hopefully that gets here quickly and in good shape. the other dress i place with my order hasn't even shipped and the rep couldn't tell me when/if it would.
other I sized down to an xs based on reviews and the fit was perfect. i am 3other b and usually take a small. i like the classic lines with the sexy edge. this is a heavier sweater but perfect for our houston fall and winter. if you size down the sweater has a much nicer fit to it and is not at all loose fitting. it just skims your curves.
other This top arrived today, and after trying it on, i wanted to leave a review to say that the shirt is 100% without a doubt pinned back on the model in the product picture. the fit is designed to be loose, so i don't think anyone could possibly get the same look as the model even if they sized down. i've included a picture of how it fits naturally, and a picture of how it fits the model as i hold the fabric back. it's still a cute shirt, just not the flattering top i was expecting. i'm debating on
3 5'7", 34c, 28 jeans, other dress. ordered a small and a medium. never tried on the medium. the small was a little big in the waist, but what threw me for a loop was the chest. huge! could work if it's meant to be blousey, but the armholes were massive. if an xs is returned, i might give it a shot. but i can't imagine what women who are smaller than me are going to do in this jumpsuit. great color, transitions into fall easily. cannot be belted or wear a camisole due to the opening at the stomach. sh
other Very comfortable and super cute. the top sold out, which i'm bummed about, but matched it with a funky black top.
other I hesitated purchasing this because of the high price, so kept waiting and then the petite sizes ran out so i figured i missed it. then miraculously the petite in the green was available so i went for it. this sweater is yummy and cozy. drapes beautifully. i am 5'1" , short waisted, and wear size other in most clothes. the petite s fits perfectly. with a pair of black leggings and high boots, this is a winner outfit for fall and winter. very comfy. the sweater has a bit of an open-weave, so keep tha
other Got this dress in the mail today, and i am blown away. the fit is amazing! normally i would get an 8 in dresses, sometimes a 6, i got a 6 in this one and it's perfect. hugs in all the right places. everyone needs this dress! i feel like with the style and fit of this dress, it should be a little more snug so i recommend sizing down. cannot wait to wear this one!
other I am absolutely addicted to tunics. so, when i saw this on sale, with an extra 30% off, i went for it. i'm glad i did! it's absolutely beautiful. i love the opposing stripe patterns, the hi-lo feature (very subtle), and the tie back. so cute!if you're petite like me, though, you may want to wear something underneath--it does cut a bit low in the chest area.
other Love this jacket. you will definitely want to size down though. i am usually a medium/large, but i was swimming in that size. i opted for the xs/s, and it is perfect.
other I'm wearing this shirt right now. i'm usually a large in tops. i bought a medium and i'm kinda wishing i got a small instead. it's very swingy. its super cute but size down at least one size maybe two
other Just a little scallop makes this top special. if your on the edge of a 10 i suggest sizing up. fabric crisp-well made and worth full price
other Despite the mixed reviews, i went ahead and bought this in my normal size. i am small-chested (34b) and found this to fit perfectly, so i understand why those with large chests were finding this impossible to fit at the top. the fabric and detail are stunning on this. there is not a lot of give to the fabric, but if you are smaller in the bust. buy it!
other I absolutely love this top, especially for fl weather.it's soft and falls just a tad longer in the back and is a little fitted in the bust area with a very feline look.i had the tank as well and just love the satin trim!i will say it runs a little smaller than the tank bc i have xs in the tank and needed a small in this!love it!
other It is a beautiful dress,but didn't fit me.this is better for someone tall and thin.
other This tee is so cute and well constructed. it's not a fabric that's going to wrinkle and pill eventually which i love. it runs tts and i like that it's thin but not to sheer that i need a camisole - just a nude bra!
other I like it a lot - very soft, just enough detail to keep it interesting, but still a classic look. i got this in a small and it's a little short on me compared to the model. i'm 5'6", long-waisted, 34b (small side), 145lbs (carry bulk of my weight in legs.so trim on top). i will keep the small but also get a medium; the small ties a little high and i also want a sweater that can cover my shirt tails when i don't tuck them in.. i got it in black, so can't comment on the orange or red.
other Remember those cable-knot cotton sweaters that were popular in the eighties?! that's exactly what this sweater is. everywhere your body bends like elbows is emphasized by the fact that cotton does not bounce back like other finer fabrics like wool and cashmere. i'll pass on this!
other Love! boys and arrows make amazing suits! i wear a 25/26 in jeans and a size small in this bikini bottom - it actually fits true to size, which seems impossible in swimwear! cheeky for sure, but so cute! fabric is super, super soft. i want to wear these all day long.
3 I wanted to love this but if you carry your weight in your hips, butt or thighs this is not the dress for you. runs tts. i'm 5'5, 13other lb and the small fit but made my lower half look even wider than what it it. also felt like it was a bit too long in length.
other Like some other reviewers, i, too, have to comment on the dress's fit. the dress doesn't fit right around the bust or the waist. as a seamstress myself, i know that the problem is that it doesn't have any darts in the bust, and thus the bust and the waist are just about the same size. this dress really just needed a few of these extra hidden details to fit right. while a belt helps, i don't think it helps enough to justify the price. it's too bad--i think the concept of it is cool, and i was rea
other This is a great little top. a wonderful basic, but the crochet/lace detail adds the perfect amount of uniqueness. it's a soft jersey material that doesn't cling. falls very nicely over the body, flow-y without being too flow-y. i ordered my usual small, and it fits tts. for reference i'm 5'1, 12other lbs, and 34d bust. i did not order the petite since i have a longer torso, very happy i orderer a regular small. will be a great spring and summer top.
other This dress is gorgeous. more ivory in person. the crochet is amazing. i sized up from my normal s to a m, only bc i wanted a loose fit. and after reading reviews that it fit a little bit like a shift, i wanted a bigger size. but a small would have prob worked as well. depends on how you want this to fit. i love it. i wear mine now w a cropped jean jacket and leggings, soon w just sandals. great transition piece bc it's a slightly heavy dress but not enough to be overwhelming or hot for the summe
other This ia a great casual top...the design flaws mentioned in previous reviews are what gives it a trendier look...the length is perfect but i needed to size down from a large to medium because the fit was a bit loose on the body and arm...would like to add that while it is good quality it's still somewhat overpriced for a t -shirt material top, lace accent..
other Nice top. you can dress it up or down. runs very large, i had to exchange sizes twice. my regular top size is 10 but end up buying size 6.
other I really liked this top-- the red gingham is adorable, and it looked great tucked into the pencil skirt i was also trying on. sadly, it had two things going against it:- when i didn't tuck it in, it looked like i was hiding an early pregnancy (it just hangs from the chest, and my bust is relatively large-- 34dd)- the material is awfully thin, and i don't know how it would hold up (that's a concern when you're spending $90 on a "casual" top)i would certainly consider purchasing this on sale
other Fits loose good material. will buy in other colors.
other I bought this shirt after reading so many positive reviews. it looks much thinner and cheaper than the photo depicts.  like many reviewers have said, it does hit just above midriff but the fringe covers your belly.  it didn&#39;t hang right on me and i felt like i was wearing a rug.
3 This was so ridiculous on me. i'm 5'8" 120 usually a 2/xs. so i ordered the xs. the inseam of the shorts are so short they barely cover my bum. and i mean barely. the romper itself was so wide that two of me could have fit in it.  love the colors, fabric, and the non-elasticized waist. if you are under 5'5" this might work for you in non-petite sizing.
other Like the color and the dotted fabric. the length is good. the fabric on the back is a nice touch. fits well and hangs well.
other I have been watching this skirt and only scooped it up on sale plus promo. it runs small and the size 10 fits like a size 8 would fit . 14other lbs and curvy figure, flat tummy but have hips and tush. the quality is just ok and not worth the full price but on sale it was doable. i love a-line styles and this skirt is different with the fabric stitching at diagonal pieces. it is light weight so i can really see this being worn more in spring and summer and a go to skirt that looks sharp . website pho
other This is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer, but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear. this brand makes some of the softest, cutest tees, but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry. not worth the cost.
other I feel in love with this piece. the color are gorgeous and i received so many compliments. it lifted my mood just wearing it! sadly, ut the end of the first wear i had a run up the front and by the middle of the second wear the light fabric got caught on something and a hole developed. upon further inspection i found another hole at the top where the price tag must have been attached. i also noticed all over pilling after the first wear! so sad! they should recreate this in a heavy fabric.
other I've been looking for the right swing dress for a long time and this one is perfect. one of my favorite features is the design at the hem of the dress (it looks even better in person!). the material is a thicker, almost canvas-y type of fabric, which i love because it makes the dress feel higher quality to me. i love how comfortable the dress is and it's so easy to throw it on and look amazing. i tried on two sizes at two different stores and received compliments from staff and customers both ti
other I bought this dress with my birthday coupon, i love the design of the fabric, and i think the length is great. it's a lightweight dress, which makes it a nice for more seasons. sandals in the summer, light sweater in the spring/fall, and tights, slip, and heavy sweater in the winter. the underarms wrinkled a lot the first time i wore it, which makes sense because i was wearing a sweater. the rest of the dress did not wrinkle at all. very satisfied!
other This shirt is so soft and very flattering. i ordered the navy in a medium (5' 10" 150 lbs). love how it scoops in the back.
other Like my title suggests this is lovely and perfect for summer. the lining however is not silk it's rayon and sat weird on me. it offered no coverage on my top and actually is quite useless (i do have a large bust). i have a free people slip that will work and because of that will i'm keeping the dress. the outer shell is silk and really lovely and the colours are true to the picture.
other I just received my duster . i love it! the coat is as pictured. the fabric is medium weight denim with some stretch. it feels like a denim coat that you have worn for years. i'm 5'8" and the duster hits mid-calf. i'm a curvy size 14-16 and the xl fits perfectly. the only issue that might arise is that the sleeves are long; they fit me perfectly but i have long arms. this will be my new go to coat for fall.
other These joggers are super cute and comfortable in addition to being stylish.  they have beautiful colors and design. if these were presented in other colors, i would buy those as well. 5,other 135. small fit perfectly.
other I love his cardigan! i knew the small would be a little big since i am normally an xs or xxs. i decided to give it a try anyway. it's definitely a little big - i would have liked an xs to be an option (5'3" and 110lbs, for reference). i'm keeping it because it still looks cute, just a little loose through the body.
other I'm happy with this sweater! a few things that may help others: 1) the detail on the yoke is made from a silky taupe-colored fiber, 2) it is ivory, not white and 3) although the fit is true to size, the sweater runs short, so if you prefer a longer fit you may want to size up.
other I am not a fan of sweater dresses and did not pay attention to this one when looking at it on-line. however, it immediately caught my attention in a store, i decided to put it on and the dress looked amazing. soft, warm, skin hugging material, long skinny sleeves and more importantly, i looked amazing in this dress.i think colors are more vibrant, design is more lively in person than in picture. i am 5'10'' 145lb, so i loved that intricate dress pattern, broken lines in front made me not look li
other I have to agree with previous reviewers in that it is a bit short on the top but i kind of like that as i am petite and most tops come way too long on me; however go up a size if you have any breasts at all. likely they will not fit in you standard size. however i just love this shirt. soooo adorable. the color is a bit more olive than brown to me though than what is in the pic :)
other I'm typically a 27. this 27 seems snug but there isn't a 28 in petite so i'm keeping these 27 petites. i ordered 27 regular also and they are too long. i'm 5'4" 128lbs. they are very comfortable. hope they stretch just a tad.
other Beautiful top... the print is really unique and already received compliments on it when running my daughter in for school. it's a little fuller on the bottom and flows out so i think i may pin it but it's beautiful. definitely worth getting!
other I think i own nearly every maeve skirt retailer has sold over the last five years, and this might be my new favorite. one major improvement over years past is the fit...it really is true to size, rather than running large as has been the case in the past. the material is a substantial, stretchy jersey with a nice texture. the weight of the fabric combined with the jersey slip means it's not sheer at all, and it also a nice smooth fit, skimming over less-than-perfect areas. i also really appreciate
other These are great quality and hang very nice. tts. i'm 5'6" and about 130lbs and the other fit and hit just above the ankle.
other This top runs large... an entire size. i am on the fence about it.. it is quite *stylish* and well made. it is fairly heavy and seems like it would be very warm. the burgundy color is nice. the issue i am having with it is the way the lower black arms are sewn in the upper arms. it just seems somewhat *odd*. overall though, it is very *forgiving*,especially with the black border around the entire bottom. it is the perfect top to showcase a great long necklace and it would be great with leggings
other For me, the tag sale is an opportunity to take a second look at items that i may have overlooked earlier, to pick up something fun at a good price. i found this dress in two colors in my size in the store! i took my usual xxsp at 32-24.5-32. length is perfect - just above the knee and the top is flattering with not too much fabric in the skirt. overall, this is a really cute staple dress. looking forward to wearing it in the spring. larger busted ladies size up. it is meant to be fitted in the t
other These have a very interesting cut. it seems like they were made for someone extremely tall. i'm about 5'5" and the size other fit in the waist, but fell way below where they do on the model on the picture. it's hard to imagine who they would look good on, they're also very poofy right below the waist.
other I have to be honest, i wear this away from the pool more than to the pool. it is extremely lightweight and comfortable, making it the perfect loungewear to tackle this california heat, and the style is fabulous- love the hassles and beads on the ties.
other This dress is as stunning in person as it is in these pictures! i'm petite, and so it's longer on me than it is on the model. i got a 4p and the waist was perfect! i thought it might look matronly as it was longer, but it looks classic. i feel like i could dress it down just a bit with flats and a cardi, or wear it to an event with heals and a wrap. it's so comfortable and forgiving in the waist and belly area, which is icing on the cake! i had absolutely no reason to buy it, but once i tried it
3 While this top has a lovely design, neckline and color the metalic threads made it too shimmery for me. i actually think it looks better in pictures than in person because of the metallic threads.
other Love this shirt. it's perfect. it's so perfect that i bought two. it is boxy but it has a lovely drape. please note, the heart is navy blue and not so black as shown. it's a thin shirt and i know it won't last a super long time, hence the back up.
other Love everything about this beautiful coat except the way it fits on me.  it is just perfect in the shoulders but once it flares out at the bottom, i look like a clown costume.  if i size down it will not fit in my shoulders.  perhaps a tailor can install buckles that match the neckline buckle to the sides of the coat to fold in the flare.  on another note the buckle at the neckline feels very hard and fake, not sure if it's real leather.
other The dress is very comfortable but runs a little big. i normally wear a 4/s and the small fits but doesn't have great shape. i'll keep it and wear with flip flops casually but was hoping it could transition out too. it's just not as fitted as it would need to be
other I ordered this online, having never seen it in person. i loved it as soon as i touched the soft material. it fits me perfectly...i almost invariably wear a size 6 in retailer dresses and tops, which gave me the confidence to order online, and this dress is true to size. the detailing at the bosom is so flattering. the fabric is supple and hangs gracefully without clinging to my not-so-perfect waistline. i have worn this twice already, having received it only a week ago. the blue/black combi
other Loved how this top looked online and couldn't wait to get it. i ordered the xs and it was huge and also very short in length compared to the picture online. i love the fabric and design but the fit was totally off. this is going back!
other This jacket is cute and comfy!
3 1. i'm 5'5" tall, 140 lbs and 38 (36d) - 32- 40. i'm normally a size 10 in most brands, and in maeve in the past. this dress was too tight across my waist and hips in a size 12, so it runs very slim.2. this dress is very long waisted, so the top bunched up funny.3. the horizontal bar in the back is in the wrong place, and will not hide your bra strap.4. there are bra strap keep loops in the shoulders, but this is an off the shoulder top.5. the underarms bunched funny.6. the dress has h
other Awesome shirt...great transition into fall. somewhat sheer. extremely comfortable!
other Lovely statement shift. sweet and sophisticated at the same time. the lightweight knit drapes nicely over one's figure. my store showed it paired with a collared cream-white blouse for alternative styling. i know i'll be experimenting with solid tees.
other This dress is stunning.  it may be my new favorite thing!  i'm not sure where you are to wear this as it is really fancy but i will wear it to work and church anyways--even if it is a bit on the dressed up side.  the fit it true to size.  i am 5'8 and the length is similar to that on the model in the photo. zipper troubles!  i can zip it off of my body--but when one when it comes to the thicker part where the zipper is i cannot zip it--decided could zip halfway and still shimmy in.
other I am 5'6" and run between a size 9-10 pant. i ordered the size 10 skirt and the waist fit perfectly and so did the back of the skirt, which i was afraid might be loose (i don't really have a butt but it fits nicely). looks like the picture so the skirt goes straight down, it does not taper to smaller width like some regular pencil skirts might so the bottom part will not be fitted, for your reference. the denim actually has quite a lot of stretch so it's very comfortable as well as the waistband
other I tried the other dresses by this brand and they were short and didn't fit well. but this dress fit better,i bought the orange size 8 and it fit good with a swing to the bottom. for reference i am 5''9 , 34dd and thin and this fit well with some room. this time they got the slip right and its not tight and the length hits right above the knee which give an overall better look plus the long sleeve balances out the dress. i'm going to wear mine with tall brown boots.
other The material is adorable and if it was available in a blouse with sleeves, i would buy in a minute. we have a pool and i thought it would be cute to wear while entertaining. now the cons, i am long waisted and this strange tie knotted high under the bustline giving an odd lumpy look. it runs short and i can't imagine who thought this design was a good idea. there were no reviews when i ordered. i am learning to try it on in the store and/or read the reviews before investing. i would say go up a
other This skirt is stretchy and really comfortable. i love the color. the only complain is it gives a little magnification to the low belly- on me at least. very flattering for the behind though.
3 I purchased this sweater because of the cute unique diagonal design. however, i was largely disappointed by the fiber of the sweater, it is rather coarse to the touch and a bad fit. on the model it looks nice, but it was large around the torso, yet short at the same time creating an awkward and unflattering fit. i shall be returning it.
3 As other reviewers have noted, the fit of this tee is very boxy.  it looks okay tucked-in to high waisted jeans, but otherwise is unflattering.  also, the color is described as black, but mine looks like a navy blue in person.  i kept the shirt because i live overseas and returning it would have been difficult, but if able to, i would have returned it.
other I've wondered abt this swtr but hesitated to order being it has dolman sleeves. decided to wait for it to come in at the local store. yesterday i spotted it in the store & tried on the orange, labeled 'red' online. i was really looking for the 'cream' but the store did not have it. well, the orange is really much prettier in person. fit is perfect in my usual size s. overall body fit & length is generous, sleeves are wrist length & i'm only 5'3". most likely the sleeves will be shorter on taller
other Love this top, very flattering. love it so much, i actually wish it was a dress...a knit summer dress with a tie at the waist would be perfect. seems to run a little big, so if you're deciding between sizes, size down.
other I actually found this blouse to be quite nice. i'm not sure that i'd wear it as a tunic, though. it looks great tucked in and the print is fun but nothing exhilarating. for the price, i expected more.
other I love this top. the picture does not show all the beautiful detail. i was so happy when it came in the mail and i unwrapped it. stunning!!
other I absolutely adore this shirt!!! the pinkish rosey color is beautiful and ended up being better than i had imagined. i will say that the shirt is a bit more casual than i thought it was going to be, the way it hangs or something..not really sure. nonetheless, it is perfect. can be dressed up or down, which is the best quality to have in any piece of clothing! i can tell i'm going to get a lot of wear out of it.
other I bought this top in black, and it fits my body type really well. it is probably one of my favorite purchases from retailer recently. the black top is really slimming and is a great cut. i usually have trouble finding tops that are long enough for me, but this top is definitely a great length.
other This is a great pull over dress that can easily be dressed to wear to work, to a bbq, or to happy hour. i have a large chest which sometimes makes this fit look like a tent but this fabric drapes nicely. the only thing i would note is the neckline was slightly higher on me than for the model.
other Love this hoodie. i bought a large to fit bigger on me and it works well. love the color and embroidery.
other I tried this product in store in red and fell in love with the fit, it fits in the most beautiful flattering way, red looked gorgeous - rich glossy fabric, this could easily be one of those effortless summer transition pieces that can go from a day dress into incredible sexy night outfit. the fabric was very lush and had this rich gloss to it, i have never seen a fabric like that, it almost looked coated. red being such a statement piece was a bit too much for me, so i decided to order the produ
other Flattering, flirty, bright, beautiful romper. i wish it come in other colors because i want more!!!!
other I purchased this dress for my bridal shower and it was perfect! the details on it are amazing-delicate and lovely! i am 5'11'' and it hit just above my ankles which i loved because i could show off my shoes!
other I love floreat and was excited to find this top on sale. i received multiple compliments the first day i wore it. it is true that it might be better with a bit less fabric but it wasn't a deal breaker for me. the flowy shape it ideal for summer.
other Was scared at first to order this product, when i tried it on i was amazed on how good it looks. fits just like the model picture, and the material is awesome.
other I am 5'0", 109lbs, 32d, and the 0 petite fit tts. the fabric is comfortable and the dress well made. my only complaint would be that the picture of the model and the dress i have in my possession do not have the same coloured slip. my dress arrived with a nude slip. i was a little confused at first but when i tried on the dress i realized it was not a bad thing. the lace actually stands out. all in all, a greal buy. discounts make it worth it too.
3 This design looks really sharp on the image, but in reality this jacket felt more like a jacket you would get at forever xxi.  the fabric had that polyester/shiny quality to it that made it look cheap.  since the fabric was pretty soft, with a gray jersey lining, it felt more like a padded jacket than a constructed blazer.  i also thought the cut was small if you have a bust larger than a b, i felt like i was busting out of a size 8, and i am a 34d.
other The color of this top is amazing--much more vibrant than in the photo and the fit is perfect. it is very flirty and pretty and the detailing around the top is gorgeous. it's pricey but i splurged and am glad i did. it looks adorable with a corduroy skirt and boots for the fall.
other Again, maeve knocks it out of the park with this skirt! great quality, style and comfort! i love that it's machine washable. so great and versatile for work or a night out! this is not a "con" but might be a bit long for short ladies. i'm 5'6" and it's below the knee.
other I tried the size 2, regular in store. they were a bit roomy and since i am 5'3", i was glad that they were offered in petite. they did not carry petites in the store so they ordered a petite 0 for me. i tried them on when i received them and they fit like they had been tailor made for me. the rise was a bit short but not a deal breaker, however, they were very long and i hoped that i had shoes that were high enough. i often hem pants but figure when i buy petites there is no need. also, the hem
other As soon as my eyes touched these pants i knew my body had to. not only doo they look great, they feel great. the material is very soft with just enough stretch. they've quickly become my favorites. i loved the first pair so much i immediately bought the other color.
3 I really like the idea behind this top, but at least for me, the execution wasn't quite there. i was hoping it would be something i could wear to work, but the sheerness of the sides makes it in appropriate for my workplace (when it gaps/you move, you can see a lot). if you don't move, the front panel is pretty opaque, which is good. i think it would look odd with a cami underneath and i don't feel comfortable with the sheerness, so i returned it. i also thought the finish on the sleeves looked
other I picked these off of the rack at retailer, mainly because i loved the navy, black and brown combo of the squares. i tried on the medium, because they looked on the small side, even though i usually wear a size 4, or small in pants. good thing too, these fit really well,so they do run small, albeit a bit long in the regular medium on my 5'3" frame. i could have used a petite for length if they had been there, but they didn't. that's ok, i don't mind rolling them up, it makes a statement i like. ye
other I was so disappointed in this top. the fabric blend was too thick for summer. the cut was wide across the shoulders, and very narrow and short through the waist. add in the odd splashes in the print, and it spelled disaster.size: i tend to run between small and xs. i ordered xs. i'm 5'5" tall, 13other lbs, 34d, 35-29-37, narrow across shoulders, with short arms and long torso.fit: the cut was so wide across my narrow shoulders that it looked baggy and felt odd. however, the sleeves didn't sl
other I got m in black with white. it's ok. material is soft and nice. classy. plan to return it since color is not flattering, makes me look old.
other I bought this jacket in the gray and couldn't be happier with it. it is loose fitting but not oversized. it will look great over a dress with boots, or with jeans. very versatile piece.
other Such a great purchase! it can be dressed up or down and seems to go with everything! great for summer!
other I get the great reviews. these do for me what no jogger could. i have hips. i never thought these would work. they do and they look just as cool on me as the model. i am a 10-12. i could only find a 1other but i think a 10 would be perfect. they are effortlessly cool and casual...for all body types. i'm so excited i tried these on.
other Holy cow! i just got a new bathing suit so i cannot splurge again, but this is flattering!!!! i like the more tame colors which doesn't scream "look at me" (let's be honest, there are certain times of the month where we'd rather crawl in a ball and hide). the design along the sides is absolutely flattering and slimming on anyone. i also like the skin-tone/coral detailing around the top of the breast that extends all the way around the back. retailer is really winning with their swimwear thi
other I wanted this top so bad i ordered one size up (only size left in navy) and it is a little big but i still love it. so fun, love the color.
other I tried this on in the store and almost considered buying it until i looked at the price tag. i think it's unique and interesting. i just don't think it's worth the $$$. the fabric is nothing special and the construction is not complicated enough to warrant the cost. i would consider it on sale. retailer has more interesting sweaters made with softer blends for a similar price - all things considered i don't think it's a smart purchase.
other I love how pretty and soft this shirt is. it falls well. i want to wear it everyday.
3 I think i received a mislabeled vest?? when i opened the package, i thought it was some sort of joke!  i was expecting what the stock photos show, a longer length flowy sweater vest.... mine was literally child sized. i'm not a big person at all.. i'm 5'6", 13other lbs, and wear a 6/8. i ordered this in a m/l, thinking i would like it loose. i tried it on thinking, maybe it will look longer once on.. no.. not even. i looked ridiculous. the front hit above the waist of my jeans and the back hit middl
other I can't get enough of maxi dresses and i can't resist tracy reese. this stunning dress caught my eye immediately, but i was worried that the back cut out at the waist would make my backside look flatter. i'm so glad i took the plunge to buy before it sold out. this dress fits perfectly, it's flattering to my figure, the print is beautiful, the fabric and drape do not cling to my figure flaws and i'm just so happy! for sizing reference here are my stats: 5'3" 140# 36dd and i purchased the medium
other The design is graceful and both my kids said it was a keeper "pretty," even the boy child.somehow i feel it makes my tummy look bigger than it is, maybe with the belt on my jeans.
other This is the perfect dress to wear casual or dress up a bit - perfect for fall and super comfy!
other Love this dress! i agree with some of the other reviewers, the arm holes are a little low but not a deal breaker. i'm 5'8" 120lbs. and ordered the xs and it fits perfect. would definitely recommend!
other This is a lovely dress with a soft fabric that drapes over the body. the pattern is soft and feminine, very much like the picture. my only issue, which is why i didn't give it other stars for my overall rating, is it's a bit snug around the bodice. this could be because i'm a lifelong swimmer however, my bra size is 3other b or c depending, so this shouldn't be an issue for this dress.other stats: 5'7" 117 lbs and i got this in an extra small per recommendations of other reviewers. the small would b
other Great sweater vest. its not too thin or too thick, just right for fall or winter when its time to start layering. the material is a nice soft knit and the zipper on the back is a great addition. its easy to put on and i don't worry about the zipper snagging the material and causing any damage. i plan on pairing it with a polka dot long sleeve shirt that i have and it looks great. i am looking forward to wearing this when the weather becomes cooler. highly recommend. i am a 36b and usually wear a
3 Cute, but didnt realize it was sweatshirt material. due to that, returning.
other Just bought this today and i love it. so simple, and at the same time it's not. the fabric makes it casual to dress up or down, but the shape of it is incredible and what takes it above simple. the straps felt a little long, so i will likely get it altered to be shortened in the straps. got the red and it's gorgeous.
other These run very small!! they are also short, almost like a crop pant. the fit was so weird that i won't even exchange for a bigger size.
other Very cheap looking material. looks cheap to cost $158.
3 This blouse ran so short in the body it has to go back. it would not cover my stomach untucked or tucked in. it's unfortunate i think it would be very beautiful and flowey.
3 I loved the shape of this sweater. the way it draped from the waist was flattering and different. the sleeves were a strange length, however, between long and 3/other length which made it look like they the sweater was just too short for me. the color looked peachy or pink in the photo, but in reality, it was almost skin tone, which was not flattering with my olive coloring. paler women might find it attractive. the real downside for me was the fabric which was thin with the flowers mainly printed o
other This dress had so much potential. looked cute when i received it. put it on & couldn't wait to take it off. it's shapeless, top heavy & just overall unflattering. the material could be cute....on a totally different dress. don't waste your money.
other I loved this purchase. the dress is beautiful. it?s classy, very feminine and rich-looking. the colors and fabric are exactly as shown on a picture. it is tailored and non-stretch, so size has to be right. i am between 6 and 8 and my size m dress fits well. had to spend time shopping for a belt as the dress definitely needs one. gorgeous dress!
other I loved this when i saw it online. tried it on in the store, and though it is beautiful, it's a lot of sweater. its a a bit heavy in weight, the buttons on the collar give you the option to wear it up or open as shown in the picture. the problem was that when it was open the big button loop hung down right in front. that was probably the determining factor against purchasing it. if it goes on sale i may reconsider.
other This top reminds me of something out of the 40's. it is super comfortable and just makes a very clean look
other Very soft and comfy tee. like the interesting neckline. wish the petite neckline was slightly higher, but sleeves are right length and have great cuffs.
other I am not a bright clothing person but adore this top. if this is the right red for you i highly recommend.! it is a beautiful bright red no orange tones so really works with my skin tones. it is a very comfy shirt and although it is a stretchy fabric it did not show any lumps or bumps in the upper back. has a beautiful flow to it and looks not only great with jeans but really cute with a patterned sweater pencil skirt i bought at retailer a couple years ago and always with a good old black pencil
other Beautiful color,, great quality, and great fit if you size up! i learned my lesson with previous purchases and sized up when i read it runs small. i usually wear a 0/other and i took a risk and went for the 4. it fits perfectly. i have a 2other in waist.
other So soft, high quality, perfect poncho sweater that will go with every pair of jeans you have. love!
other Love this shirt it has a femine look with a casual style.
other This is a cute top that can transition easily from summer to fall. it fits well, nice print and it's comfortable. i tried this on in the store, but did not purchase it because the color washed me out. this is not the best color for a blonde. would look much better on a brunette. if this was in a different color i most likely would have purchased it.
other Perfect for summer nights. makes any outfit that much special!
other This top is absolutely stunning. i purchased the white one. just received and it fits nicely-a little on the big side but i believe it looks better that way. this will look great with everything. it is well constructed and looks very unique. love it!
other Looks great on the picture but when it arrived it was a great disappointment, both the colors and style. the material seems great quality but it's stiff and scratchy, the style is very boxy, and as another reviewer said, just hung. i'm a brunette and the colors looked terrible on me. back it goes.
other I received my coat today. in love! it is so flattering in so many ways. it may not be form fitting, but i love all the details and i'm a sucker for hoods. this is a great fall/winter coat especially if you live in the south. it will probably only work as a late spring/early fall coat for you northern ladies. my only compliant is that the arms are too long, but i'm only 5', so it'll possibly be the perfect fit for someone else.
other This dress does indeed run large like the other reviewers mentioned, but it also runs small in the shoulders. i'm 5'3" and usually a size 6. the xs fit perfectly in the body, but was a little too small in the shoulders. i liked the dress enough to size up to a small to fit the shoulders, and then just had the sides taken in slightly. i did purchase this dress during the 20% off sale, so that helped justify the cost of alterations.
other I love love love this swimsuit! yes it's a bit pricey for a bathing suit, but i love the design and colors and the back detailing is sexy yet not all that revealing. i can't wait to wear it in hawaii next month! the only part to be careful about is not to stretch it too much when putting it on and taking it off, i can see the diamond cutouts stretching or even ripping if pulled too hard by accident. overall a great swimsuit for the summer!
other Awesome light shrug. goes with so many out fits, over tees and dresses. tts. get one! orange color is a pretty neutral.
3 I only tried on the ivory one, but it was so see-through, there was just no way. i can't speak for the other colors. seemed true to size, maybe a little large, but that's the style. very cute design, loved the back. too bad.
other I love the weight of this shirt and the open scoop neck. really flattering ...i wear tanks under my shirts anyway but it is see through. the weight is nice even in heat, and i expect it to be so nice layering in the winter. the cut at the hem is great..... very flattering and does not seem to cling.i bought a white one, now i have repurchased another white (xs) and a black one. while i was vacillating, theblack xs sold out so i got a small and will cross my fingers that its not too big.
other This dress is soft and hits all the right spots. the neckline makes it a little alternative which i like.
other This cardigan is lovely, casual layering piece. it's a very thin lightweight knit and pairs well with a tee or tank under it. i really like the color and the style. the longer front can drape or tie for multiple looks
other This shirt is structured enough to wear to work and flirty enough to wear out on the town. the details around the neck and the bottom make it very unique. i paired it with a chunky necklace and got tons of compliments. however, i could imagine this shirt may not work for those with a bigger bust line as there isn't much give in that area.
other This bra runs very small, and is hard to get on and off. i think if i went a size up i would be happier.
other These are the second pair of paige jeans i have purchased, and i have not been disappointed! jeans are great for casual dress or a night out on the town. fit stays true even after first wash. wish i had a pair of these in every color.
other Didn't like at all. itchy fabric, looked good on model but on on busty girl.
other Beautiful shirt, hits me a little higher. i'm not sure i'm going to keep it just because i have something similar but its a beautiful top. i'm 5'6" and carrying a little extra baby weight right now so i'm an 8-10 instead of my usual 6-8. i ordered an 8 and it fit well.
other I found this jumpsuit at my local retailer it must have been a web order return i love it the fit is true size the colors are perfect it's very comfortable and gorgeous on and at the sale price i could not pass it up
other This looks so cute...but don't be fooled. it is so poofy. it does not look in real life like it does on the model. it poofs way out on the sides and looks ridiculous. i was so disappointed.
other I put on this t-shirt and my husband said it makes you look old. he was right. i'm not sure if it's the cut or the pattern but i found it completely unflattering on my petite frame and it looked cheap too. perhaps on someone else it would look different. the pattern is overwhelming and the sleeps are a bit too look and ruched for my liking. it may look better on someone taller.
other I ordered this dress in the green ,and i love it. it does run a little large so i went down one size, which was ok by me!! it is super cute!!
other It's the inverted invert ... not so obvious at first but then it shrunk and was harder to ingnore.
other The prints are very cute and flattering and the material is thick. i'm 5'other 107lb and 32c and got the xsp, my usual size. the shoulders and sleeves fit perfectly, the neckline is a little low (questionable for work). the fit however is off on the waist -- which is not as pictured. it is more of an empire waist ad barely even clears my boobs, so i doubt even a regular xs will change this much. it isnt a flattering look on my frame altho the prints hide it somewhat, except from the side view. also,
other I purchased in white. the material is a little thinner than i like, but the material is soft. runs tts over all. the arms are long-but i like this in a t-shirt. i will probably pick up another color in this shirt.
3 I ordered a small and i'm usually always a small. i could not zip it up. i'm am returning it for a large, and this is concerning because what if it is big in a weird way because i'm usually a large?
3 I just got this in the mail and was so excited to try this cute top.....but it's completely see-through! unlike the photo shows, the lining is not included. quite a disappointment top is well made though no give in the fabric.
other I agree with the previous review, i too would not have purchased it if i had not tried it in the store (which is other hrs from my house!). the colors are much more saturated but not gaudy. the caveat, it is quite short. i am 5'10", 13other lbs. i purchased a medium as it gave me the length i needed.
other I definitely trend towards preferring my clothes looser as a style but the fit on this dress felt a bit too boxy, i typically run between and x-small and small, should have gone with the x-small. i loved the print and quality of the dress though and would recommend it!
other I've been looking for a navy shirt for some time and this is it. it's soft, drapes nicely but it's not as dressy as silk shirt would be. the navy is really blue, not a black-navy like so many. i've washed and dried it in the machines and it came out well. shrank just a little, but that made it perfect. for me it was true to size because i liked the slightly over-sized boyfriend fit, yet it still has shape. if you want a fitted shirt, go down a size or look for something else.
other The label says 100% linen, but it's so silky and drapey that it feels like silk and linen. it's not a scratchy linen at all. it's a very very fine knit, but the top is not sheer. i do not think you need a cami under it. i bought the xl and the fit is just as shown. it has a slight drape, but it's not really baggy at all. i bought the grey and it looks lighter on-line that it really is. it's a bit darker and has a silver essence also. i liked this so much, i just bought another one in mauve.
other I bought my usual size medium and it's huge on me. if i sized down, my chubneck wouldn't be comfortable. the buttons are frustrating. the color, the pattten, the style are 100% gorgeous! i think i will belt mine
other Finally, a white top that does not show every nook and cranny. this is a great fabric. many times white shirts are see thru and i won't buy them. this top is lightweight but has enough substance to cover everything. the online picture does not do it justice.it can be worn with anything and is made very well. this one's a keeper for your closet and will be worn over and over all summer long.
other The most important thing to note about this skirt is that it is a true blue color- not black! it's also perfect for spring , summer and early fall. super comfy, casual yet elegant. size runs a tiny bit small as the waist is not elasticized. a staple of a cozy chic wardrobe.
other This dress is so flattering and just beautiful in person. love it!
other I love tunics, i love sweaters, i love turquoise. i ordered this in large, and it fits well, but the arms are very long. i don't like constantly pushing sleeves up so i wear it with the cuffs turned back. a previous reviewer commented on the length and another about the bagginess. i didn't have issues with either. it hits just above my knee (5'5") and it is appropriately proportioned around the the body of the sweater. so what's my reservation? how the sweater is more delicate than it seems. the
other I'm an hourglass shape and on me this dress didn't give me any shape at all. and i felt the bell sleeves were a little much. the lining though is really soft and excellent for colder weather. and the print is very pretty, just as pictured.
other Beautiful dress! the pics online do not do any justice! i got compliments all day!
other This top is really a great, and it's very affordable. the fabric is light weight, but opaque enough that you don't need a cami. even though this has long sleeves, i can imagine wearing this well into the summer (and i live in south florida). it's comfortable, and the band at the bottom is not tight. the color is slightly ivory and the floral print is clear and bright. the neck tie is really nice and adds a '70's vibe without being overdone or overly dramatic. definite keeper.
other Gorgeous, color, fabric, and cut. i ordered the blue in a 14. i always wear a 14p or large petite in retailer. i purchased a regular 14. it's a full size too small in the ribcage. cannot zip it up.. i'll be exchanging mine for next size up. even though i'm 4'11", the length is fine. if you're tall, it might be pretty short for you.
other Beautiful material, great design. get a bigger size.
other I love sundry clothing. this lightweight fleece is the perfect weight. it keeps you warm enough when it's cold, but not hot when it is milder. it's super soft with nice embroidery. size other is a great fit for my 5'1" frame. wear it to hang at home or to go out.
other This is a perfect change of seasons into cooler (colder!) months piece. colors the colors are muted, the pattern is modern and stylish, the cut flattering. sizingthe sizing is generous, and fit is easy. love length, which is true to the product photo- fitting at about the bottom of my fingertips. i love the coverage without looking too covered.quality it's soft, a great weight ---and the quality seems good. i have already worn it a few times and it is not one of those sweaters
other I found that this dress ran very small. i am true 8, ordered a 10 and it was snug
other Love this shirt! looks perfect with a pair of jeans! makes the outfit with out any effort!!!!
other I am not usually a khaki type of pant person but these are really cute and have interesting details such as the buttons at the ankles. they are also quite flattering and do not "bag" out after a day of wearing. i am 5'6" and about 130lbs. the size 2s fit great. i purchased the "green" color and it goes well with a number of tops. these can be dressed up with heels and great to run around on the weekend. the material is soft which is always a plus for me. overall a great purchase.
other I wore this for the first time this weekend and loved it. it is long and lean but not baggy or tent like. i'm 6'0" so i appreciate the length and fit. will get a lot of use out of this. good w/ skinny jeans and i can't seem to have enough black tops.
other Loved everything about this sweater but the short length.  didn't notice in the pictures but the last one of the back of the model shows the length. it barely reached the very top of my jeans so would have to wear something under or i'd be flashing my stomach all the time.  worked a bit better with skirts, but still too cropped for my frame. wish it was 1-2" longer in length and would have been a new fall favorite. really great color and design besides that. just make sure you are wanting the sh
other This is a beautiful summer dress. i especially love the exposed back which is the perfect cut to not show your bra and feels professional enough for work. plus it's comfortable, drapes nicely, and is machine wash and dry.
other This dress is exactly what i needed.  it's so easily dressed up or down.  heels and jewelry for cocktail this time.
other I was skeptical about the contrasting color details on this blazer, and it turns out i was right to be. this blazer just looks like part of a prep school uniform, both in the colors and the fit, which is very boxy. maybe this is someone's style, but i just don't think it looks good.
3 I originally bought this shirt in the blood orange color, which is lovely and vibrant. the shirt is extremely comfortable and very flattering. however, it is also very, very cheap. after about five washes, it has pilled and worn, the color has faded a bit, and i doubt it will make it through the spring. for perspective, i wash all my clothes on cold and use the "air dry" setting on my dryer.nonetheless, even having experienced the wear and tear, i went back and bought this shirt in every other
other Last minute i needed a family-friendly top for a chilly night, so i tried on a couple of flowy sweaters at retailer and this was the keeper. while i found other styles a bit too boxy or bulky for my short torso, this has a nice a-line shape that gave me a slim profile while still being forgiving, plus the detail up top is feminine and i liked not having fabric piled up around my neck. i am usually a small but wanted this to fit like the model so i sized up to a medium and voila, i am a model. just
other This top is really cute for the right body shape.it is tight around the bust area if you select your size and sizing - you lose the shape.
other The is a cute dress with a great pattern and nice material. it would look great on the right kind of figure. i'm 5'7" and slim, but at thirteen weeks pregnant and not showing, the skirt made me look about thirty weeks pregnant, but the top fit just fine.
other Hi there, if you are looking for a shirt you can wear all summer long; this is it! soft, a little darker than shown in the picture (which i like better), and super comfortable. it also keeps me cool in these hot june temperatures. a great blouse to throw on with shorts or white jeans, and it can easily be dressed up for casual fridays at work. it is definitely oversized, but no more so than all clothes these days. i stuck with a size small and usually wear a size 4/6 in tops. so, if you are ti
3 This skirt was cute on, but not particularly flattering. i thought the denim was a little too stiff. typically, a-lines are flattering on my figure, but this was a miss.
3 These are the very stretchy, almost spongy, type fabric.  i ordered my usual size and they fit me like a sausage skin.  crazy small!!!
other I tried this on in white and my usual size small. it is such a beautiful top and the detailing, lace trim is so pretty. my only complaint is that it lays funny on my cleavage, and i don't have much. it just gathered there and appeared clingy in that area. it's also one of those...am i hiding a pregnancy tops. i like it, but i think i'll wait to see if it goes on sale.
other I really love this sweater. beautiful color and nice texture. i can't wait to wear it.
other I'm a little on the fence about this dress. it doesn't do much for my fairly straight/petite body type; i.e. it's not fitted at the waist which i think would help even though i don't have much of a waist to begin with. but the low v-neck is flattering and the flared skirt is too. it's just that it probably looks better on an hourglass shape... i was fine with the fabric type, i'd describe it as a mid-weight ribbed knit blend. i'd say it's true to size, i got my usual xspetite and i'm 34aa, 26",
3 Another shirt i really wanted to love. i adore green but so few tops are made in this color. (please make more!!) however, this shirt didn't work for me. i think it's a matter of where your curves live. the shirt was true to size, but my boobs meant i was showing more cleavage than the model, and the top part felt more like a bib than embroidery. sad coz it is lovely and feels lovely on. probably a great shirt for different body types. would love to see more green clothing....
other Love the suit! i ordered two sizes, and this 6 ended up being too small. i'm 35x27x36 and 34d, and there wasn't enough support in the bust. read a lot of mixed reviews regarding sizing on the seafolly suits, so i'm glad i got two. suit is flattering and i love the coverage in the bottom. some boyshort suits are "cheeky," but these are not like that. only complaint is that while there is a pocket for the cups, they are sewn on top.
other I really love the pattern and the look on the model, and i thought i would love it. i ordered online, so i did not try on in store. when i tried it on, it has way too much fabric around the waist and skirt. it is thick fabric as well, and has a lining, and the waist has extra fabric for the design, and it has pockets, so it all adds up to be way too bulky. it is not flattering at all and made me look 10 pounds heavier. i am returning this dress. sad, because it looks so lovely on the model. i am
other I bought this to celebrate my birthday! i get a new "suit" every year. it was a milestone birthday and this dress did not disappoint.
other This jumpsuit is absolutely fabulous. i normally don't wear jumpsuit but i like this one very much. it can be dresse down or dressied up. i really recommend this to everyone any shape who have. very relaxing and beautiful.
other I have these tops in white and blue. very comfotable to wear. the back part swings with movements and is flattering. good price so i got one for my daughter!
3 Wish someone warned of the navy one being not as pictured!! i ordered the navy because the crocheted part appeared to be more intricate than the ivory. in reality the navy knit is just like the ivory. it seems well made but very delicate. i'm not a fan of tops (especially pricey ones) that require a camisole but this top is a very "retailer" piece so most likely i will keep it, just a bit disappointed.
other Hands down most comfortable bra ever!
other This shirt is perfect. hangs nicely, and i love the little longer sleeves.beautiful color too!
other This looked fabulous on the model, of course, and i love sweater dresses. but even in an xs, i was drowning in fabric and looked ludicrous. concept is good but execution went terribly wrong somewhere. a definite return.
other This top is really nice and the fabric is more substantial than it looks in the photo. it has a great shape and is nicely made. i ordered an xs, which i nesrly always wear, but i measure 35" in the bust and it fits well, but no extra room. i'm petite and it is not too oversized. really cute top and a great value.
other Ag jeans have been a main stay for me. they are the most comfortable and best looking jeans on my body. however this pair was too tight and shorter then i liked. the fabric and color is beautiful. i wear the same size for ag no matter the design. but this one ran too small. i have to return it. i will try the next size up if they still have them.
other I saw this in the store and wanted to try it on, but ran out of time (a week or so ago). i thought i would need petite, but surprise, it does not come in petite...so i started obsxessing that i had to try it on, whcich i did yesterday. mistake, because i love it, and even if it is not peite, it workedc (with heels), and online it already says only a few left, so my size will not make it to sale... so i bought it full price.cut is very flattering, and colors are great. also can be worn any seas
other I am very pleased with the quality and fit of this dress.the reader outfits next to the listing were darling. i do not care for the model shot. i think the dress is true to size and well constructed.
other This is so beautiful and looks hand made but in a really good professional way. this will be a perfect fall wardrobe addition and i can't wait to wear it with a long sleeve top and jeans and boots. it's not too long and it is very flattering and soft and drapes well. love it.
3 I was so excited to receive this sweater in the mail since my local store didn't carry it. it is a very cute design if you have a smaller frame but i'm curly up top and it didn't lay they way it did on the model. there's plenty of stretch. unfortunately the fabric sheds and itches terribly. you could wear a shirt underneath but i'd have to wear a turtleneck so it'll be going back.
other Just what i was looking for. soft, cozy and warm.
3 Saw this tunic on line and when it was immediately sold out i thought it had to be a winner. after several days of trolling on line the 2p was finally back in stock. now comes the disappointment. yes, the material is sheer but would be a nice weight for humid summer days. the front looked exactly like the model. cut with high side slits that truly made this a tunic. the back of this tunic is some sort of origami design. the fabric bunches out at the butt area. it's bad when you're standing and i
other Saw this in the store and loved it! the photos on line do not do this justice. material is soft and substantial. if you love the look of raw edge you'll love this piece. as usual i wish it were a bit shorter even in petites as i am only 5' but kept it and love it.
other I ordered this dress in the green color. the dress did not look like the picture. i returned the dress since it looked like something to wear to a farm barnyard dance. i returned the dress.
other This is such a beautiful dress. fell in love with it at first sight. it is very pretty. can be dressed up or down .. comes with an attached slip that is a tad longer than the dress and it shows on the bottom.. darling dress that will get lots of use this summer.
other Love this sweater. it fits true to size. fun and different. purchased 30% off but i don't think the price it terrible depending on your clothing budget.
other I really like this skirt. it is soft and the length is just right. i hate skirts that go below the knee. the only thing i don't care for is that there seems to be extra fabric in the back... maybe i should had ordered a size down. and the skirt does wrinkle easily. still, not enough reasons to send back. i have had many compliments at work.
other If you are looking for a nice vest, this vest is nice enough, comfortable, and soft. the cut is also flattering, but i just didn't think it was as special as i wanted. it looks like many other options out there, so i decided to pass.xs fit me at 11other lbs.
other I feel like an indian goddess in this dress! lots of swing to it!
3 Loved this dress until i tried it on! it was too big in the body and tight on top in the arm area. from the reviews already posted stating the guy was great, i'm wondering if i just received a defective dress? i also wish the dress were a truer orange/mango color instead of a burnt orange since this dress is for spring/summer.
other Looked good in pictures. i even ordered an xxs petite and it was huge! although the sweater has interesting textures and is very beautiful, it is very awkward and poor fit. will be sending back.
other Love the fit of this dress! i'm 5'2" 120 and the petite extra small fits perfectly. the waist is slimming and the cut is not too low. also great pattern.
3 This is super cute and the colors are so vibrant and its thin enough to wear with tanks for the summer but it already had a hole forming in the upper back shoulder.  i guess the material was a little too thin....$98 is a little too much money for something that gets holes so easily!
other I have a love and hate with fit and fashion. i love super beautiful clothes that are comfortable to wear. normally i am the one everyone keeps asking where did you buy that and i inwardly roll my eyes because my rule of thumb is dress with the most comfortable thing i can. now i'm also a full figured mama. these outfit made me look chic parisian and made my derriere look like it was very attractive. i have a long torso and a long neck and long legs and it hid my flaws. so if you want to look lik
other This is an adorable dress. medium weight. i highly recommend.
3 I really wanted to love this t and was excited to receive it in the mail. i thought i was being realistic in assuming that is would be somewhat sheer given that there doesn't seem to be a woman's white t on the planet that isn't these days, however it was really sheer. the fit was also short and boxy (this coming from a 5'3 woman who is short-waisted) on the plus size the material is extremely soft and the design is cute. maybe if you are younger and don't mind the sheerness it's worth the gambl
other Fantastic price right now and very flattering!! cute and sexy dress that hugs but its forgiving!
other The print is beautiful and the detail on the chest is so pretty. th fabric is a soft t-shirt martial. i ordered a medium and it fits like a large. it is supposed to be flowy and loose though. overall i feel beautiful in it. great for our hot humid charleston summers!
other I chose the petite small for the shorter length & fits perfectly. it falls abt 3" below my knees. normally i am a small in tops. waiting for some cooler weather to wear with some of my swing style turtlenecks i have & jeans. 5'3", 115#, 3c. looks pretty much on me as in the pic.
3 This vest is very nice and fashionable, very stylish. i like it a lot. however, it is too itchy. the opening in the front didn't allow me to close as many buttons as i like but i would totally wear this stylish vest even though it is not as functional when it is cold. however, the itchiness is too much. i don't wear wool unless it is ultra soft or mixed with cashmere, so i could not imaging wearing this vest, it is too itchy. why ruin such a good thing?
other Absolutely love this dress. maeve dresses have always been constructed with great care and quality. i am and always have been a size med in maeve dresses. the dress is soft and flowing. the fabric is very forgiving and moves with you. i recommend trying on a dress by this maker . . . their cuts are consistent, so i feel extremely confident in buying their clothes online. this is a keeper and can be worn year round.
other Love this shirt...got it in the "blue" but i will say the print is a very dark navy, almost black. i'm 130 lbs, 34d and the size 6 fit me fine. so i would disagree with other reviews that says it runs large. this is perfect to hide muffin tops with the slight swing style that has a little flair!
other Other reviewers have pointed out that these tops (i have both colors now, spoilers!) run long- and i am happy to agree. basically, there's a lot to work with here. i'm always looking for longer tops to traverse a larger bust, and this is a great hip-hitting length for me. plus, the neckline can be style multiple ways. all in all, a flattering better-than-basic sweater.
3 Such a cute dress it was just way too big in the back of the dress, too much fabric, it just hung withno form around waist. it appeared more fitted on the model than the one i received. dress was quitea bit longer in the back so i felt like the front was riding up just in the minutes of trying it on. sadly i have to return it. it did come with an underneath slip which was necessary as the fabric was verythin.recommend with caution to sizing.
3 This top runs small across the top. i was amazed at the material--polyester, i am sure--because the price was so high. it has a sheer layer underneath, which i think would make it hot in the summer. i love this kind of tank but it just did not look as good as it does online.
other Love this dress!  it has a nice stretchy weight to it and is texturally interesting. it's the first retailer piece that i ever bought my teenage daughter and she looks so sophisticated in it, like a young lady. it's both classy and youthful!  for reference, she's 5'other 100# and is wearing a 00.
other This tunic is wonderful, wash & wear - comfortable and classic - love the trim. many compliments on this top.
other This dress will be very useful. it fits loose, but it is suppose to. i plan to wear this to casual parties, out to dinner, and possibly a wedding at a winery. i weigh am 5' 6", weigh 14other lbs, and ordered a medium.
3 I'm 5'7, 125lbs, and the small fits perfectly. the sleeves are the right length (i have long arms and legs), and the body fits loosely, without looking sloppy. at my height, the small is not long enough to wear as a tunic, which is fine.unfortunately, the shirt arrived with makeup stains around the laces and the inside of the shirt, so i had to wash it before wearing it.i only purchased this shirt because it was on sale.
other This dress has a really lovely design and is very, very comfortable. it is not quite as flattering as i had hoped, and doesn't have quite as defined a shape as i expected. still, it's cute and i'm happy to have it!
other I adore this top! it's comfortable and cute. the sleeve length is great for wearing bracelets. it's well-made. just perfect.
other Wore this & got many compliments. true to size, elegant.
other They fit perfectly and the stretch makes them very comfortable.
other I love this sweater. it is classic but has details that make it fresh and different. the tie in the back offers very interesting detail.
other I didn't realize the patterned material was tee shirt material. i got lots of compliments on it though. i'ts blowsey from the bust down (i got the short sleeved red one) but it's comfortable without looking sloppy. if you can pull off the tucked in look, it's super cute.
other This is a great layering piece. got in orange color and it is really a beautiful shade. i am 5'3" 36dd and went with a m. very flowy, nice length (more on the short side), and not see through. i am able to wear without a bra, where the ruffles cover any possible chance of seeing anything ;). i have a black came from another brand and have literally worn it to pieces. goes well under a jacket for work, a kimono, wrap, denim jacket, just anything! i was a bit disappointed it is "dry clean only", h
other The pictures do not do this blouse justice. the pleat in the front is so flattering that i did a double take (this detail doesn't come through the images, which is a shame as it is the most beautiful element of this blouse). the collar that stands up just enough is something unexpected, and the sleeve length is fun yet sophisticated. i am madly in love with this blouse and highly recommend it to anyone. it is extremely see-through...so unless you want to show off your nips, you should expect
other Great green color. drapes well. nice gray detailing adds dimension to an already pretty sweater.
other I am 5'3" and the arms of this sweater run at least other inches past my finger tips. if the arms were not quite so rediculously long then i would definitely keep it but unless you are tall, it just doesn't work. also, i felt the length of the waste was a little shorter than what is pictured online. sigh.
other I really liked these cords. i ordered both colors. they are very lush corduroy material and the color is very rich. since i am short, i wear them as ankle length (i am 5'1"). my only issue is that they run very large. i am normally a 25-26 and the 2other was still a bit large. unfortunately, they are all sold out of size 2other :(
3 I love the shape at the neck but the lack of shape really distracted me from loving this top. the fabric is nice but the big, boxy shape on the bottom doesn't do much for you. i agree with the other reviewers tha this top would be great as a maternity top because it really is cute if you have a baby bump. returning the top.
other The minute i put this sweater on, i couldn't wait to take it off. it was way too scratchy for me. so, for those with any type of sensitivity to wool, this is not the sweater for you. otherwise, i thought the design was quite cute.
other The first time i wore it, felt wonderful. had it cleaned and then the back end stated pilling. very disappointed with the price and quality. wish i could return for my money back. sad
other I love this top! it flows nicely and fits perfectly. i'm 5' other 1/2", 12other lbs. and ordered the small. i love the little bit of sparkle in the blouse, too.
other Swingy and just the right weight for the office. the cream is ever so slightly sheer but looks really good with a darker bra, even for the office because you can't really see through it. i'm wearing this all the time this fall and winter with skirts, black pants, and skinny jeans
3 I have mixed feelings on these. i ordered the honey which is a mustard color as shown in the picture. they are true to size, cute, and comfortable. i washed them the first time with a load of darks and the color ran onto other clothes. plus the pants looked a little streaked in some areas. i'm not sure if this was a bad lot, but back to the store they went.
other This is a beautifully made jacket. i ended up buying the cream color as the yellow had sold out. the cream goes with everything, so that was probably the right decision. the inside of the jacket has a silk lining with a scotty dog pattern. the jacket fabric has just the right weight to hang properly, without being too heavy.
other This is an awesome go to for dressy or casual! wore it with booties for a dinner and flats for temple and was perfect for both! lace is a little delicate but worth the extra care!
other This shirt is beautiful and well-made. the lace is soft - not scratchy at all. looks great with a cream or gray cami underneath.
other I tried on the xs in store (would need xxs i think, it is short enough to not need petite). anyway, the neck part was really bunching up on me (between neck and girls), it wasn't flattering. the rest of the tank is really pretty and flattering though, but the bunching was enough for me to leave it behind. the fabric is soft, and the color is nice warm neutral. i love the lace back with the subtle layer of satiny looking fabric. overall goo, perhaps i don't have the right shoulder shape fr this.
3 I feel the same way about this shirt as i do about the sungarden tee. it's a lovely pattern and i like the fit (it's not clingy), but it's a bit see-though. it's not as bad as the other tee, but no contrasting or patterned bras can be worn with this shirt (unless that's your thing). that said, i'm happy with it because it's a soft and pretty shirt that will get a lot of wear in warm weather. i am very glad i got it on sale though. i wouldn't have paid full price for it.
other I decided on these last minute for a date last night and let me say...i looked hot. :) they are super cute and flattering (im slender, but hey, im also 53) and could be dressed up or down easily. the but is because when i got home i realized that i had ruined my new gel manicure from the black die! it comes off so easily that you should be cautious of your car seats, sofa, etc. i made the mistake of not washing first, but do! hopefully thats enough to help because these are great leggings.
other The blue color is sublime - the material velvet iridescent cool - the fit is loose and not something to wear to show off your figure but it is has a cool swingy boho vibe that was what i was expecting ... add a cool shirt jacket to elevate it and give it more structure
other This was not what i was expecting. at all. i am a medium in just about everything but ordered a large to possibly wear this as a dress instead of a tunic since i am around 5' 4". the large fit like a small on me, and not like a typical oversized sweater type small, but a normal fitted top small. a previous reviewer said it is long and straight, and i think that is a good description for it. i think the models wearing this in the pictures are all wearing an extra-large #or a different cut of the
other The quality of this jacket is outstanding. color combination is very chic and sophisticated. jacket is warm but not bulky.
other Love this tee. it has a drapery cut which i love. the only thing i found was that it ran a bit smaller.
other I received this today and will have to send it back. it is super cute and the quality is great. however, you need to wear a bra or a halter bra due to the style which is not a proble, but my 32d chest looked huge in this top so it is going back.
other The fabric is too sheer, also looks like sleepwear. just not my thing.
3 Run large and leg is very wide. even sizing down, they seemed too floppy.
other Even at a very deep discount, this piece is definitely not worth the money. the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design (which would be cool)--which is largely what attracted me to it, but as i discovered when it arrived, that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo. so this image is rather misleading. the actual jacket is very thin--more like a shirt with an open front than a jacket. the pockets are just loosely tacked inside. for
other I am 5' and 3/4" tall. too "tall" for most petite pants and too short for regular pants. these ran a little big. i weigh @140 lbs. and have been wearing mostly 28s and 29s, which is what i ordered. the 29s were a tad too big around the waist. the 28 fit but were so long that they looked like clown pants on me. i am in the conundrum that i can never find cropped pants that fit because i am in between petite and regular height sizing. these were a perfect example. they both went back. loved the qu
other I have no where to wear this pretty spring time inspired dress.  fits just as pictured, except that i'm short.  i ordered the 10p so my 36dd chest and wide rib cage fit comfortably.  i'm saving this dress for easter or a fancy bridal shower.
3 This dress had so much promise from the picture. i loved the midi length, color, and fascinating waist detail. i ordered online, so there was no way to try on before purchasing. the fit was disappointing. it fell in an unflattering manner at every point; a tad too low at the waist; a tad too long at the shin. just kind of saggy all around. bummed, but this is not to say it wouldn't fit someone with a different body shape better. the quality of fabric is nice, and the color is lovely.
other Not sure why this is considered a top--it's an open front cardigan. also the the maker is monogram/hwr, not knitted & knotted. soft knit, inverted pleat at back yoke, slight flare after the armpits, slightly fitted at shoulders but not restrictive. pretty much looks like the picture! hand stitch elements seem to be the random embroidery sprinkled throughout the sweater. colors are dark blue-black, navy blue, gray, blush, ivory and turquoise. i am 5'3" 135# 36d 38/28/3other and i purchased size mp.
other Love this! perfect in the summer with bright, strappy heels or sandals or booties in the winter.
3 I was very excited when i saw this in a perk email and immediately went to order it. unfortunately, the stock image of this pullover is misleading. it's boxy (image makes it seem like it's form-fitting) and the weave/mesh is much thicker and open in person. as shown, you do need a cami underneath. i ordered this in a small and medium since it's an online exclusive and there were no other products by on the road to see reviews of to know how their tops fit. i wanted to love this. i didn't think i
other The knit collar and the color and the drape is what makes this lilitz cardigan so wonderful and an excellent addition to my signature retailer sweater collection. as previous reviewers stated, the color is not orange but more of a marled rose yarn. the body of the sweater is lightweight, draped, stretchy and warm and the knit collar is much heavier. because of my body type (36ddd, heavy upper back, rounded shoulders) this cardigan doesn't look great on me when left open as the collar doesn't fall
other I think these jeans are amazing. they are very flattering and most of all comfortable. i often will go up a size when buying white but i didn't have to with these. they also relax very nicely as you wear them. buying white jeans has always been a challenge, often they are to thin and not that flattering. i don't feel the same about these, they are the perfect summer white jean. i think i need another pair!
other These pants are a really pretty color and feel nice on. the fit was great and did not really shrink with washing. i received a lot of compliments the first time i wore them.
3 I loved this dress and ordered it online. i found the colors to be a bit more muted than i expected, and unfortunately the fabric quality seemed low considering the price point. ultimately i decided to return it as i couldn't justify spending $178 on a dress that didn't seem as well made as i would expect from retailer.
other I loved how soft this dress was, as well as versatile. however, i only got to wear it one time because after the first wash, a giant fabric tear happened on one of the seams. unfortunately, the fabric is so soft, but rather thin, and it didn't hold. the care instructions say machine washable but i wouldn't put it in the washing machine again. especially since i often have to wash clothes twice in the washer i use because it's so old and barely agitates. would love this if it was made a little be
other I bought this in a medium at the store (usually a size 8 -10) and bought one for my daughter who was with me ,in the coral color. (she's 7 months pregnant , and bought her a small. it fits fine below the belly. she loves how comfy it is.) my other daughter saw them and i had to buy her a pair as well. :>) so, we were hanging out at the hotel on a girls weekend and wore them at the pool and even to sleep in. i think you can actually dress it up and wear it out and about as well. i did see that a
other Beautiful, washes well in a garment bag on delicate. has little clips in the shoulders to hold bra straps which is crucial with the scoop back if you have sloped shoulders like mine. i normally go for a large, but was definitely a medium in this dress. 32" waist, 32f bra, only minor complaint is that the pattern (at least on the red, though probably also on the others) is just printed on the outside and the inside is faded almost white, so since the sides of the dress are slightly longer than
other Everything about this dress is beautiful except for the hemline. the color is beautiful; the old-fashioned, wispy femininity is beautiful. the dress probably could use something better at the waistline besides elastic, maybe ribbons to tie, but the hemline is what kills it. it is half a normal-length dress (in the front) and half maxi dress (in the back). the designer should have chosen one or the other, not both, and it would have been much better. for the category of aesthetic/design, i would
other This shirt dress will make a great piece for the summer to throw on. the length is perfect for either a dress or throw on some tights as a shirt. i bought the beige color one and it's a little see through. would def need to wear a slip on.i am 5'8 120 pounds and the xs fit perfectly.
other I am loving this shirt. i thought it would look ridiculously long on me but it does not. for me this is a great substitute for the cloth & stone fringed plaid buttondown dress. it's definitely not a dress but is long enough to pull off the layered look of wearing a t-shirt and this on top. it will be a great piece for the fall given how incredibly soft and light weight it is. highly recommend.
other I bought a size s in the navy, and m in the neutral, and both fit. i usually wear a small, but they only had the size m left in the neutral. the m is a little big, but the extra room fits the flowy, bohemian style of the blouse, so it works. i love this top and am glad i purchased it in both colors. definitely recommend it.
other I noticed this dress in the highlighted area and then read the reviews. i probably wouldn't have thought much about it just scrolling through the dress pages, and now i'm so glad i bought it. i have worn this dress several times and never fail to get compliments on it. i know i will wear it again come next fall. i am petite, but ordered the regular and find that length to be perfect. i'm a teacher and this dress helps me maintain a classy yet modern look. i purchased the small (usually wear size
other Really really like this dress. expected it to be shorter based on other reviews, but at 5'6 it it was a great length for me. it is true to size and while it was a little bit of a loose fit, it was just enough to hide trouble areas. sometimes i struggle with dresses such as this because they are too big on top and snug in the hip area, but this one was perfect for me. great find!
3 I bought the pink one. i like this salmon pink color! not too girly type of pink.the material is super soft and light. i have skinny torso, so it looks really nice on me not showing thin body...the only thing that disappointed me was it shrunk after the first wash... it shrunk one size! when i bought it (size s), it covered my flat hips, fits just like the picture, but now my hips are showing :(i recommend getting a size up if you are too lazy to wash cold & air dry.
3 This is a gorgeous dress. i got the red version. it's stunning...the zipper is trash however. i'm scared of getting stuck in it like another reviewer.
3 The quality of this shirt is great and the colors are pretty. it just made me look super wide. i feel like the waist is too high - not quite empire and not quite at the waist. it just wasn't going to work for my body. maybe a different size would work but i don't like it enough to try.
other I bought these pants to wear while riding on the back of my husbands motorcycle. i wanted something that was more chic than typical motorcycle women's clothing and these were perfect. they block the wind but are stretchy on the back side so they are super comfortable to wear all day. i also wear these to work on fridays! i bought a size 28 and they fit great. i usually wear a 6 in us sizing.
other Runs almost two sizes small. i plan to wear as a jacket over a sleeveless dress / skirt / trousers like a suit. the material is sturdy. i recommend for early autumn or spring weather. once again, a collector's item with unique colors and design of pattern.
other I loved this top online but it arrived very wrinkled which raised a red flag as to how it would look after wearing it. seemed high maintenance. also, didn't love the fit. color is vibrant but overall not a fan of this top.
other This is my first pair of mcguire jeans, and i like the fabric and fit.  thank goodness for petite sizing!  these 32p fit just right on my hips, with no gap between the waistband and my body.  fits through thigh and hips and pretty slim all the way down.  nice stretch.  of course, the proof will be after wearing a few times and washing.  i will update my review if i do not like them so much after that,
3 Ordered size 12, it fits but pulls a tiny bit in the midsection. also way too long, hits below my knees. the dress is beautiful: crisp black color, nice fabric, great neck. it's also the kind of dress that must fit well to look good. i had to return mine.
other I love this color blue. when this item went on sale i had to grab it and i'm glad i did. it feels medium weight to me so i could throw this on, on a cool summer night and also in the fall. there is some sparkle to the fabric which i think is really a nice added touch. feels comfortable on and looks adorable.
other Taking the sweater out of the package i was kind of skeptical because of the shape, but to my surprise it looks like as it does on the model. it does take a minute to figure out how to wear it. i ordered the medium (normally wear a size 8) and is a little long, but goes with my personal style. i love the idea of being able to wear it out without looking frumpy or comfy at home.
other After reading the reviews, these leggings seemed to be the best leggings ever. i'm usually not a leggings gal, but decided these might be the ones to take me through winter with long cozy sweaters. i read the profile of those who purchased and were happy with the fit before making my purchase. i'm 5'2", 134lbs and bought a medium. while they fit nicely through the waist and thighs, from the knees down they're baggy and really don't fit like a legging. in the photo you can see some slack around t
other Very comfortable, fit over my muscle-y and flabby arms! very pretty.
other This is a beautiful top but the xs was literally 4-6 inches too wide. very disappointing! i am thin and tall but this was a maternity top on me. i don't usually wear xxs. it is much more voluminous than it appears in the picture and it is definitely gray and blue not white.
other These jeans look amazing on. i'm 5'5" and an hourglass figure and these fit perfectly. if you like high waisted jeans, these are for you! a small heal does need to be worn but i wouldn't say they are excessively long.
other Such an adorable top. very flattering despite it's rather full style. just be sure you get the correct size since it does indeed run quite large. i normally wear a small, sometimes medium. i ordered both sizes to be sure but they were both too large! i sized down to xs and that fit perfectly.
other Great fabric, great fit, great shirt. just found my new favorite for this summer!!
other I tried on this top and it looked fine until i tried to move. you can't lift your arms. i tried on a larger size but still felt like the movement was limited in the back and arm areas.
other I seldom take anything but a size m in retailer tops. this m top fits ok but it is a bit sloppy overall. one reviewer says it is 'body skimming' but not on me. i am a true m yet a m seems to fit in the shoulders but overall just too big. i love the fabric and print however i will exchange for a size s if it is available. it does hide the tummy area but ends up looking like a pajama top on me.
other I am just over 5'8"and i found that these pants hit me in a weird spot on my torso, almost creating a muffin top that i don't normally have. in addition, they were too short on me to give the chic and modern look of cropped ankle pants. on my frame, they fit more like capris from the late 1990s. both the construction and execution of the pants are otherwise fantastic.
other I love this top. i purchased it in an xs and feels it is tts. it can be dressed up or down. i recently paired this with the cloth and stone chambray drawstring shorts and it was the perfect summer outfit. the button details in the back are such a nice touch. i got many compliments on this top.
other This is a great dress that can be dressed up or worn with flip flops. i also love that it has pockets :)
3 I tried this sweater on in the store. i wanted to love it so badly as it is soft and feminine, and would be a great causal layering piece. however, there are pockets in the sweater that are right on seam, and they actually bubble out from the natural drape of the sweater. not to mention, unless you're built very narrow, the pockets will fall at, and accentuate hips, and not in a flattering way. the nice details are the feel of the knit, the layered style, with a cottony lined hood and "faux" lay
other I had been on a white jeans hunt for some time. pilcro is one of my favorite brands, and i can buy online with confidence knowing they will fit. if petite had been available, that would have been better in length, but it was not so i had them hemmed.
3 Ordered this in xs my normal size (5'5" 110 lbs) and it was huge! did not particularly care for the style either nothing special.
other This top is beautiful in design, but sadly, i will be returning. it is hand wash, and even after doing so, i had other unraveled threads resulting in large holes. unfortunate since it was so flattering before washing.
other These are adorable and very very comfortable. i'm loving the flattering mid rise.as stated before there is no flare as depicted in the photo but still super cute!nice with flats, easy to dress up with some sexy heels.
other Didn't work on this curvy gal.sizing up would have helped with the button gaps, but the flowy shape of the blouse would have looked too maternity on a larger size.major pass.
other I love this onesie! i get a lot of complements when i wear it. the only issue is that it's slightly too short in the mid section. it tends to give a tiny bit of a wedgie. but it's not nearly significant enough to give it a bad review or return it. overall it's comfortable. i did have to size up because of that issue but it still looks great.
other I'm an xl in retailer tops, and the xl fits nicely in this blouse. if you are athletic or slender or have a petite bust, you can probably size down..this is a nice lightweight sweater. i would not say that it is too thin or anything like that; its just lightweight for being categorized as a sweater. i absolutely love the pattern placement of this sweater, it makes the sweater so unique and figure flattering. honestly, i'm not crazy about kimono/bell sleeves because i feel they are at best impr
3 Cloth and stone has been getting a little shotty lately in terms of quality. they used to be a pretty consistently high-quality brand, but lately i've been left a little bummed. i got this in "yellow" which is really a muddy orangey color. i think i would have gotten over the less desirable color if the fabric were better, but it is actually two very thin layers of fabric that are stacked and snag easily (sort of like a soft cheesecloth). the shirt is definitely comfortable and cute, but the qua
other I liked this online but loved it when i received it in the mail. i normally wear a m/l and the medium fit perfect. it is gorgeous and flattering with a tie at the waist. the bottom is flowy. i knew it would be sheer from the reviews so that wasn't a surprise but i really wish it came lined. no one wants to wear a slip to the beach and i feel it's too nice for a cover up.
other I just got this shirt the other day, and already love it. it fits like a basic tee, but the details on the sleeves and back are really cute. the shape is loose at the bottom, which makes this really comfortable.my only complaint is it's a little tight across the back, but this does not hurt the overall fit and comfort of the top. this is a little thicker than a tee shirt too, so the quality feels nice.
other Perfect light weght sweater for the holidays. i love the detail in the back. the xs was a great fit for this 5'2", 11other lb body.
other Got these in my usual size and they are wonderful! the gray goes with everything, i'm hoping they come out with some greens or blues too!
other Super comfy, easy to put on, and super cute! you can dress it up and dress it down! i'm usually a size s and the small fits fine, but i think the xs would have fit better.
other The embroidery on this dress is beautiful in person. perfect dress for fall.
other I like this top. yes it is very cropped and fitted but that's the style as shown on the model in the picture. but its true this style may not fits everyone. it probably flatters those of athletic or petite figure more than a full figure. i am 5' 6" 110#. my usual size is xs. the top looks small to me at first so i tried both size xs and s. i took the xs cause i like it look fitted than loose. i wear this top with high waist fitted skirts or pants and it looks great. if this top can be an inch lo
other Really pretty blue top. great for wearing around the house if you want to be comfy and casual yet look good in case your neighbor shows up at your door, of if you have to run a quick errand! if your wear it with distressed jeans it will add to the casual vibe. the blue is vivid and perfect for any hair color. don't get me wrong. the top is casual and cute. it is not sloppy and has an international, worldly vibe. i recommend it.
other I was worried about ordering this top after the first review, but i was very pleasantly surprised. the sweater is a nice weight on the front panel, and a lighter weight knit on the back panel, which gives it a "flowy" quality. it looks slender and trim in front, with the unexpected surprise in back. the transition between the front and back panels is well done, which doesn't really show in the photos. i purchased the yellow sweater and had many compliments on it's uniqueness the first time i wor
other Really beautiful top. i agree with the others, a bit on the short side. it is cut a little wide but has a nice flow. the color is not pink. it is a blush type color that can be hard to wear for some skin tones, but i'm going to make it work because the top is too pretty to pass up.
other I'm 5'4" and weight 130 and i usually wear a small in dresses from retailer. although this fits everywhere, it's a tad shorter than i expected based on the fact i figured the model was at least 5/7" and this looks to be mid-thigh.. it's mid-thigh on me so i'll be wearing tights and boots- can't wear without tights...imho. otherwise, so comfortable and cute...
other I was so excited about this dress. but when i got it, there were several issues i had with it. the neck is just too high for me and the skirt is too pleated and makes my hips look wide. i was hoping for more of an a-line cut. gorgeous though! wish it worked.....
other This is a nice, heavy sweater for cold days and lounging in jeans. very comfortable and flattering.
other I tried this in the fish print and the pallas stripe. i did not like the fit of the fish print, but the stripe is perfect--so try more than one color if you are interested in this style. also try more than one size of course. i almost always order up in a swimsuit, and this time was no different. the medium fit great, although i am a xs-s according to the size guide. i am a 34b for reference, but i think my rib cage is somewhat wide. i do not like to feel constricted, but i still want the top to
other I ordered the red/orange but it was much brighter than i expected (felt almost neon). and the dress felt much more casual than i expected from the pictures online. that said, it's a great dress and i am keeping it - just adjusting my expectations/what i plan to wear it for.
other I ordered this on a whim during retailer days sale and i'm glad i did. it's now one of those shirts that calls my name every morning. i've worn it with denim skinnies and a knee length black knit pencil skirt. so soft and flattering. i got it in the red, but am tempted by the blue!
other I'm always searching for a "dressed up tees" and these were fabulous! true to size and great quality!
other I ordered down a size based on other reviews. i am 5' tall, 110 lbs and a size 26 is a great fit. i ordered both the navy and turquoise colors. my only complaint is the turquoise color is not the vibrant blue in the photo but more of a green tone.
other I was able to snatch this dress up just before it sold out (and i see it's now back in stock!). the quality of the fabrics is outstanding, not flimsy at all. the top is stretchy. normally i would wear a other at retailer, but the only choice i had was 0 and it fit. i am 5'5" tall, 12other lbs. everything about this dress makes me smile and i can't wait to wear it to my holiday party! don't hesitate if you are on the fence.
3 Just got this in - love the color and fabric, but it has no shape on me. i thought i'd wear a large because i have a 36ddd chest, but i should have gotten a medium, at the largest. also, even if it did fit, it came with a stain resembling toothpaste right in front. i'll be returning.
other This dress is amazing! love the fit, quality and design. so unique and is perfect for dressing up or down. wore it to a wedding and plan on wearing it to work. also, i'm a tall girl (5' 11") and this dress was such a good length for me. no one likes a dress that's too short. i ordered a size 8 and it fit perfectly around the waist and chest.
other I snapped this up under the 20% off top sale and free shipping because it looks so pretty. i ordered a large because i usually take a large or xl in tops. it is huge! i could have taken a medium if not for the lining -- which is tiny! the lining does not cover the chest and bra area and hits the belly button area while the orange part falls down to the hips. and it looks like a block and makes me look wide. who needs that? like i said, a medium would fit better and would not be so wide, but i fe
other The lace detail is very classy. a great go to white dress.
3 First, i absolutely love this dress, and i was super excited when it arrived today. i sized up as other reviewers recommended, and the dress fits perfectly. however, when i zipped the dress up, the zipper came apart in the center. going up another size would make the dress fit improperly, so i am hoping to exchange it for a new one and have better luck with the zipper.
3 I ordered this dress in coral. while i like it and the dress is nice, i have many other outfits that i like better so this will be going back to the store. i might have kept it in black or blue.
other I was so excited for this dress to arrive, but when it did, it was a major disappointment. there is no lining on the skirt portion of the dress leaving it sheer. also, the top part along the chest puckered in a weird unflattering way. the colors were beautiful, but not enough to to make up for the other design flaws. i am 5'6" 140lb and the small fit tts. will be sending it back
other This is my favorite top! it is gorgeous, soft, & oh so comfortable. it's not too tight & works with leggings, jeans, or as an over-shirt. love it!
other I don't know why i never reviewed this beauty. i love the colors and pleats and contrasting embroidery. i'm busty
other Can be dressed up or down. details are pretty without being gaudy. i got an 00p which fits well - i can wear it with a belt to give it some shape too. love it!
other These are the perfect wide legs.  they aren't overly wide (a common problem for petite women like myself, who cannot pull off the really wide styles), and they are nicely fitted in the top.  the fabric is a great weight, neither too heavy nor too light so they lay nicely. (the similar level 99 linen wide legs with the waist ties have a much lighter fabric that doesn't lay right, and i like these hei hei pants much better.). i said they run large because i tend the fluctuate between 00p and 0p, a
other This top fits exactly like the last photo, which was my hope. it is not as slim as the other images. it's a swing top and the arm holes are perfect size, and the mock turtleneck is not too high. the fabric is thick, so will be perfect transitioning from summer to fall.
other What a shame this dress is. i wear xl and am 5'2", but the dress in the store in the size xs(!!!!!) looked just the right size. yup! xs was just the right size. i can't imagine anyone who wears m or s finding this dress fit flattering. it would look like a sack. it is an inch or two too short in the front for me, so i'll be returning it.
other When i saw this sweater online i ordered literally immediately as i was afraid that is would sell withing an hour!i am shocked that it is not sold out!when i received it in the mail it is even prettier in person.the "pink" tulle peplum is actually more of a taupe giving the sweater a more sophisticated look.the sweater is soft and cozy and the peplum is such a beautiful and elegant touch.i wore with silver flats and jeans and wow, got so many compliments!runs spot on true to size and is a
other Love the fit of this sweater! it almost fits like a sweatshirt and definitely not as long as on the model. it hits me just below the hips( for ref. im 5-3"). im considering getting all the other colors because its so cute and comfortable. could be dressed up or down. runs true to size-im always a small and this fits perfectly roomy.
other The top is just as shown in the picture and it is tts. lots of detailing with beads and lace. i'm 5'1, 92lbs and purchased a petite 00. just as the other reviewers noted, the side slits do come high. high waisted jeans or leggings works perfectly.
other This dress looked gorgeous, light and lacy in the picture, but when it arrived, the "lace" that appeared gold and black in the photo was more a solid brown pattern against the black which was not attractive. the inner sheath was made of a heavy, sequined material. it was uncomfortable, scratchy and felt like i was searing chain mail. it also added bulk to the dress, so that i looked ten pounds heavier. i can't imagine why they would design this delicate dress with such a heavy inner slip. the si
other These pants are so warm and cozy and comfortable. they are like cashmere for your legs...so amazingly soft!! and for that price, it's definitely worth getting all the colors!!
other They ripped on the inside upper thighs of both legs less than two months after purchase. i've washed them once, and wear them a few times a week, so they're certainly not worn out. i've never had a pair give out even close to this early. i loved the cut of the jeans and the softness, and they hold their shape well after multiple wearings. the color is lighter than pictured. i paid full price (the most i've ever paid for jeans) because i'd heard good things about jean shop quality. even at sale p
other I love this tee. as others have noted, the "pink" is really more of a coral orange, which is what i was hoping for. i wish they had another good color for a redhead because i would buy it.
other I was returning something to the store. before i stepped out of the store when this skirt caught my eyes. it's such a nice skirt, with the gorgeous red color, beautiful buttons and material that is heavy and thick but soft. i paired it with a white shirt that is currently on sale and fell in love with both matching together. it is tts, i'm 5'other and 120lb and i usually get 0-other in size. size 0 was sold out in the store so i tried size other and it fits me very well. the length is great, it falls 2-3 in
other This top is very nice heavier weight linen. i normally wear a small or size 6 in retailer but this seemed a bit on the larger size than normal. it's still great quality and i'll probably keep it. a great item to wear for a long time!
other I agree that this blouse is boxy, but because it's not too long in length it evens it out. any longer or shorter would make it look too boxy. it's great for work to dinner during the week & goes great with jeans too.
3 After eyeing this product online for awhile, i was able to try it on in store. i'm so glad i did, because while this dress is lovely, it is clearly not designed for my body type. i have a small rib cage and a large bust (32h,) which is i think what caused the keyhole to be so gaping on me. additionally, the straps of the dress were up by my neckline instead of lying properly on my shoulders, which was unflattering and left my bra straps clearly visible. the fabric was gorgeous and soft, and the
other Very cute, but i would not call it pink. it's more of a melon color.
other I bought this blouse in the purple motif and love it for work. great design and print.based on the existing reviews, i sized down from my normal xs to an xxs and i actually wish that i would have stuck with the xs only because the blouse is tighter on my biceps than i would prefer, but i am keeping the blouse. i always appreciate this in other reviews, so hopefully it helps: i'm 5'2", 117 lbs, and a small 32b.
other Cloth & stone has to be one of the best brands at retailer! they consistently produce versatile, comfortable and quality pieces time and again. off the shoulder is back and here to stay, and without a doubt, this is one of the best i've tried on. the denim is a perfect, summery shade, but will transition well into fall with some darker denim or black jeans. i am 5'7, shoulders that are neither narrow nor broad, and a little busty - i got a size m and it fits great. i absolutely love my shir
3 This shirt has beautiful coloring but the material wasn't as soft as i thought it would be. i was hoping they would be the super soft material, maybe washing them would help, but i didn't want to chance it so i returned them.
other I bought this in the blue and really wanted to like it--i had plans to check sizing and then order it again in the red, as well! however, this skirt falls victim to the recent design trend of using a pattern for a structured skirt but substituting a softer fabric and (horrors!) an elastic waistband. this ended up just looking kind of cheap and sweatshirty as a result. back it went.
3 This dress is so pretty in the photos but in person it's huge. and not in a way i could adjust by sizing down. the shoulders and arms fit but the body of the dress is absolutely huge. i normally love a trapeze dress but i was swimming in this so it was quite unflattering. it was also much longer than it looks on the model. i'm not short - in fact dresses are normally a bit shorter on me than the average person but this was just frumpy.
other I saw both of these blouses several months earlier and anxiously waited for them to go on sale. definitely worth the wait. the quality and designs are superb true to size
other I saw this in-store, tried it on, and was sold. it is not just super soft but very flattering on. i am petite, 10other lbs and bought the xs in black- the sleeves are short enough that no petite size was needed. i will wear this a lot with both skirts and jeans.
other I love this top and find it flattering, but the black and white polka-dotted motif that i purchased definitely has navy blue in it -- not black. kind of disappointing that the color description was so inaccurate.
other Maybe i shouldn't have sized up to an xl but i'm not sure a smaller size would have solved the weird fit. the vee is quite low and i'm busty. it'll be really low if you're smaller on top. the fit from back to front where it ties looked horrible on me. not tight at all. it's almost balloon like around the hem and from the side view, i looked like a really wide green apple. i hate leaving a bad review because i know someone may love it but i wouldn't recommend it.
other These tanks are perfect for working out! they have big armholes so could work with a bralette but probably not a normal bra. the material is soft but they do shrink in th wash
other This top is as pictured. i'm other feet 120 pounds. the small petite was a great fit. the material is cozy, soft and somewhat thick. dress it casual with jeans or elevate it with slacks.
other Great job from the fabricators in creating such a gorgeous print on light-as-air silk! i'm so happy with the dress and can stare at it for hours, that's how pretty it is. the fit is perfect on me and disguised my figure flaws since it's an a-line skirt that doesn't cling. yes, the skirt is sheer and unlined and for the price a slip should have been included. fortunately i own a silky half slip that complements nicely. i'm a top heavy 36dd, large rib cage, 140# with a square waist and no hips and
3 I took this too to the register thinking it was marked down to same price as another tee by the same brand. it wasn't so i ended up paying way too much for a thin tee. will probably return.
other These jeans are great quality, but they just hit too low for me to be comfortable.
other I love this tee, i bought it in white and the bright salmon pink and wished i could have bought it in all the colors. the v-neck is low enough to show just a hint of cleavage without being too revealing. the rough edge of the hem is a nice touch. i like the double-v neck in the back as well as front; it adds a little interest to the back and is not too low. the label is sewn on with red thread which shows up on the white color in back but in a nice way. overall the length and cut are just ideal.
other These ultra-slimming jeans are so comfy. the rise is a little higher than i am used to but it covers those little muffin tops perfectly. the color is very dark - almost black which adds to the slimming effect. i have really long legs and these have a little extra at the bottom, which is great. you could wear with flats, booties, boots - just about any type of shoes. these are my new favorite jeans.
other The pattern is actually knitted into the fabric instead of just printed on like i've sometimes found; the embroidery mostly serves as a highlighting feature instead of a focus. the inside of the cardigan is another layer of fabric, sort of like a double knit? but with its own, simple striped pattern. the collar looks like it might be itchy, but it only is until it gets stretched out a bit and arranged properly.
other Super cute and more fitted than the baggy overalls of yesteryear. i love them.
other 1. i like a shorter jacket, but this one was poorly made and poorly fit.2. the sleeves were way too tight. i'm a size 10 or 12, and the large which would be a 1other had tight sleeves that wrinkled up my arms, and the hem of the sleeve turned inside out.3. i ordered both a medium (size 10) and a large (size 14) , and neither hung right. the m too tight, and the large too loose in the body and too tight in the sleeves.4. very polyester with lots of static.5. cute idea, but not very good in pe
other Buy this skit- it's everything that retailer used to be. great pice, work appopriate, and it fits great.
other I usually buy xs or s in retailer clothing and the pieces usually fit perfectly. this time i purchased my first petite item because i was worried the length of the pant leg would fall at an unusual spot if i didn't. i'm 5'other and i ordered a petite small. i was swimming in it. the elastic in the back was so loose you could see directly down my pants. i wanted to love this but unfortunately the size did not work for me.
other Nice flowing summer sun dress. i was looking for something very simple and put a colorful kimono over. it. i put a bando under it. i think this dress can be for all ages as my friend in her 20s bought and loves this dress as well.
other My only wish is that the front waistband were more high-waisted, but other than that, the pants are darling--flattering, vintage yet on-trend and made with high quality fabric and tailoring. i am 5'2" 12other pounds and i bought a size 4. they are a perfect fit.
3 The pink version of this top finally arrived -- nearly other months after ordering.  the expected delivery date kept slipping.  the color is not as shown online.  online it looks like a light pink.  the actual top was more of taupe color.  it's a basic tee with pretty ruffling at the bottom.  not enough to keep.
other I really wanted to love this dress, but i couldn't. it ran large and heavy. rather than a sleek cocktail dress, it felt more like a heavy sack once i put it on. there was one upside: the drape in the back did not appear to drop quite as low, so finding a bra to wear under the dress might be easier than if it draped as low as it appears in the picture.
3 Love the print, length, and cut. but the tie waist hangs in a weird way and seemed like it would stretch out and sag after a while. sad to return it.
other I have 9.5-10 size feet, and these are a bit small; the heel doesn't quite make it around my heel to where it's supposed to be. still, they're comfy and not too thick or too warm. i really like the stripes of different patterns. good trouser socks. i imagine if you're size 7 or 8 these will fit perfectly. i got the mint and the pink colors, and they're very true to how they appear on my computer screen.
other I don't usually go for swing style dresses as i am petite, but this one was totally cute. i like the color a lot, wasn't sure it would work as i am rather pale, but it is nice. the xs p was returned at my store, why i tried it on... winner. 11other lbs, 26.other in waist, 30dd chest. i can see myself wearing this in summer, spring or fall (with boots).
other I ordered the black other months ago, it was on back order, and i jsut received it finally. the fabric is super soft, itried on both xxs and xs and could keeo either one. the "v" in front where it crosses is low, so most people do need a cami underneath, but you could probably do without for ultra sexy look (not my style, but could be done). i plan on wearing this with skirts, deresses and slacks... i saw a commet on the lighter color, not sure, but love this one in black for sure@
other I was desperate to find a dress for an upcoming wedding. i basically tired on every dress in the store. this one was by far the best dress i tried on. the outer layer is delicate, and has great stitching and embroidery. the only problem is that the slip is skin tight and too small. this dress is so awesome i'm willing to overlook that and find my own slip. when i came out of the dressing room another couple stopped to tell me how amazing the dress looked. this dress is beautiful!
other I love this sweater dress! i was hesitant to order it after reading some of the reviews, but fear not, friends--this is a comfortable, flattering, warm dress with a unique twist. i love the cowl and the buttons down the back. the knit is fairly large so there's some give to it, which means pulling it on is a breeze, and the buttons don't slip out of their closures unexpectedly, which is an added bonus. i ordered both grey and navy. i stand at 5'6" and would describe myself as pear-shaped, typica
other Agree with other poster. this shirt runs very big. i'm all for a flowy, shirt that hides my belly but this is just a tent. i'll be retuning it.
other It is one of my favorites from retailer. i received so many compliments while wearing it! i usually wear a 6 but i sized down to a other and still had plenty of room.
other I fell in love with this top when i first saw it on the retailer website and was pleasantly surprised when it was every bit as beautiful in person as it was online (even more so). the bronze colored threads are to die for and the fit is perfect on my 5'4" (129 lb) 34c frame. if your on the fence on this one, get it. it's worth the purchase!
other I bought this jacket in green and it is beautiful. the green is a trueforest green. sizing is accurate. my only wish is that they offered more colors and the snaps were double faced so you could snap the collar back.
3 I have been looking for a quality pair of black skinny jeans for a while. after reading the reviews, i had such high hopes for these jeans. i bought it in my usual size 28 and while the top part fit perfectly, i found that the bottom was too tapered in and ultra skinny making it not look right. sadly, i had to return.
other If you're a girl with no junk in the trunk buy these pants! they make you look like you are working with something! i love them. i am 5'3" and always struggle to find pants that aren't too long and that will help me not look like an ironing board. these are great. not too long in regular and like another reviewer said, you'll have a booty. great lightweight pants.
other I absolutely love this dress. the quality is perfection. the design is adorable and it is comfortable! i paired it with leggings and short boots and worked 10 hours in it. and i worked a large event so i wansup moving things and active almost the entire time. it was the perfect combination of dressing up for work yet being fully functional! oh and the neck line ads that extra touch of style that makes it a great piece. love this! it is also true to size. i have a medium.
other I saw this top online and fell in love with the overall casual look.i ordered all 3 colors, and they just arrived........love love love !!!they are soft, comfortable and a have a very flattering casual fit.the understated ruffled details add the special "something" that is so retailer.they are sophisticated yet pretty.the orange is more vibrant in person and is a beautiful shade.the plum/purple is a rich, unique and pretty color.the navy is a perfect "denim" color.a fantastic basic
other I tried this dress on today and ended up buying it. its a thicker material and looks better in person. more red and white striped with an uneven hem. the back of the dress is a bit more like a swim suit. i probably is best for smaller chests. i'm guessing it runs a little bit big - as the medium fit nicely on me and lately i'm a large medium/small large.
other These pants are so comfortable, it's ridiculous. they are lightweight and perfect for spring/summer at the office or an evening out. i am 5'9" and the pants fit as pictured. i paired with a sweater and kitten heels. they do run a little large so consider going down a size.
other I love this tunic. purchased the dark orange in medium (i am 5'9 and 140 lbs). tried the small and almost kept it but i felt seams around my arm pits a tad, so went with the medium and glad i did - this top should be comfortable. feels very fall and perfect for casual get-togethers and running around town. only comment is that it is rayon... and for me anyway rayon doesn't wash too well - so we shall see how this one fairs.
other This cape/poncho item is totally amazing. from the moment it whispered over my head as it slipped past my hair, i knew i had to have it. this piece is magical. it feels like you're wearing a blanket (the warmth factor), but the length is so perfect that it doesn't overwhelm you, nor does it make you look like a tank. the colors are amazingly saturated and the quality is so worth the price. the model is wearing it with light brown, but i tried it on over black leggings in the store and it works w
3 As other reviewers have noted, this is a pretty top. i really love the design. alas, however, it is too big for my frame. for reference i am barely 5'1" and about 10other lbs. i ordered my usual xxsp and the fit is just not flattering on me. it is looser than on the model and the flounce does not hit me in the proper place. the top is also too wide so that it has these odd gaps near the armpits. i highly recommend this top unless you are an xxsp. i am going to have to part with it, sadly.
other This will be my third pair of hei hei shorts.  i was very pleased with the previous two shorts, sand city short and dobby beach comber.  all shorts have nice materials and not too tight, perfect for the summer.  i typically wear s or m depending with the material and design.  i bought size s and it fits nicely.
other You will love this cardigan. very well made with beautiful details. the sleeves have the same detail as the collar and the back. has darker flecks that will go well with dark pants or cords or jeans. you will love this cardi! wish it came in more springy colors. i only gave it a lower rating for quality because the first one i tried on had a sleeve that was much tighter than the other sleeve. the replacement was fine!!
other The mara hoffman cross-front one-piece is worth every. single. penny. the colors are vibrant--a perfect compliment for my fair complexion. the cut of the suit is immensely flattering, particularly the definition created at the natural waist. the quality of the suit is impeccable, and i have never felt so confident in such a little number! and guys, it's reversible (inside is a gorgeous royal blue).
other Love this sweater! warm, cozy and and not ordinary!!! fits great too! no surprises!
3 As another reviewer mentioned, maeve really needs to get their sizing under control and more consistent. i ordered a 4, and while it fits, i think a 6 would be more comfortable in the arms and shoulders (and i'm a thin build). the length on this was also a little weird to me...a little swingy/flared, but also short, making me feel like i'd always be playing with it while wearing. the orange print is absolutely adorable, i just wish the cut were more similar to past buttondowns that maeve has don
other I really love the fit of this dress. i said it runs true to size, and it really does--even with the stretch fabric around the back and adjustable straps, i would not recommend sizing down as i normally do at retailer--there is no stretch to the actual fabric on the dress. i'd never bought anything by this brand before, and i would say that the fabric is quite thin for the price of the dress, and it is not lined (i'm still hoping it's not see through). however, for me, the style makes up for
other It's thin knit with a unique and pretty neckline, but unfortunately it's scratchy will not last. i just received it and it looks like it would fall apart after a few wears. it's a nice shade of offwhite at least. for me it's a no that will get sent back straight away.
other This top also caught my eye in my local store, and being a devoted deletta lover, i had to buy. it is a straight, slim fit, so i bought a medium, instead of my usual small, to glide over my curvy lower half. it's thin, finely woven knit, with two cute little buttons at the top of the side slit; the cut and longer length in the back is very flattering. i bought the heathered black and have worn with my black pilcro leggings; it's a great top to wear over leggings or skinny jeans; no belts with th
other I initially tried this on in store and fell in love with the beautiful cut out details and fit. the star design is really cute and unique and the blue color is not see-through at all. i eventually had to buy the blouse online because i could not stop thinking about it. also machine washable is a major plus.
other I'd give this dress 6 stars if i could, it's possibly the best dress i've bought at retailer in 1other years of shopping there.  the fit is fantastic with the ruching around the waist adding camouflage  for anyone with a bit of a tummy. the cross back stamps hide a bra effortlessly (even those wide supportive bra straps that larger cupped women need to wear), the mature rial is soft and silky to the touch, the fit is true to size, the pattern is bohemian and elegant -- not hippy dippy at all. i'm 5'6"
other I am a lover of jackets and coats; this is my new fave! great color, versatile (i.e. work, weekend). fun accent piece to shield yourself from a brisk wind, while maintaining full fashion status. my first day wearing and i've rec'd many compliments. love the combo of trench coat and poncho. my one issue...i wish the sleeve strap actually buckled, it keeps slipping out of the faux buckle and i'm afraid i'm going to lose it. i usually wear a medium/size 10, but medium was sold out, so i ordered
other These shorts are super comfy and the color is awesome!
other This is nicer than the first reviewer states. the fabric feels very soft and the tunic does not look cheap.the top of the tunic was a little more fitted so it was a little tight for me since i have wide shoulders. i will have to get a larger size.
other I keep trying to find a peplum that works for me, but so far i have been unsuccessful. i just do not think that my shape and the peplum shape play well together?aside from the peplum issue, this shirt had a massive amount of material and runs large. the material alone is thick, making it a bulkier shirt, then add the volume of the peplum and i looked (and felt) huge. needless to say, this one was returned, sale or no sale.
other Received this yesterday, wearing it today and am happy.  it&#39;s warm and cozy - perfect blend of sweatshirt and sweater for when you want to be comfortable, yet still look like you tried. i&#39;m 5&#39;4.5&quot; and 130 lbs. i ordered an xs and it&#39;s still pretty roomy which is how i think it&#39;s supposed to fit. i would prefer it to be a little more form fitting, but not enough to send back.  great with skinny jeans and boots.
other I saw these on the freshly cut + promo discount & decided to order my usual size 28 reg in pilcro. a great fit & appreciate the midrise. not too snug or baggy. look pretty much on me as in the model pic except they fall abt 1" below my ankles. i am only 5'3" so not a surprise they are a little longer on me but it's really ok. fyi - the front button & back pocket tacks are gold which gives a classy look to these jeans. just love.. & love the price too! 5'3", 117#
other Love this kimono. design is bohemian and it will be a great layering piece. can be belted over simple black dress or layered with jeans and boots. almost didn't purchase because of the reviews concerned with fragile material but i didn't find that to be an issue once i felt the garment. great piece for fall.
other At 5'3" and 15other pounds with a short waist, it's hard to find attractive jeans. hit the jackpot with these. they're comfortable, very slimming with a perfect rise and length. i ordered size 3other so i did go up a size. love the button closure instead of a zipper. these are much better than my citizen boyfriends that cost twice as much. try these, you won't be disappointed!
other Very comfortable sweater. the material is very soft and not itchy at all. i had the hardest time deciding between sizes. the medium was slightly longer and loose through the arms. a bit of a boxy shape. the small was slightly more fitted through the arms and instead of hanging straight had a slight fit and flare look to it but still loose. ended up going with a small since it was less boxy. it's a sweater that can look more put together or more laid back just depending on sizing but overall love
other Oh yes. another sequin top to add to my collection. it is sparkly without being glittery- if you know what i mean. can definitely dress down as it is tee shirt- like. lots of options for this one. tts.  much better in person than the online pics.
other Adorable sweater with a loose knit that helps slim down my man-back appearance. cut is tapered to the body but with a soft flare at the bottom hem. not clingy, very soft fabric doesn't accentuate bulges so i am happy about it's forgiving silhouette.
other This one didn't work for me. there is no zipper, you climb into it from the very large neck hole. it was very low cut and the shoulders kept sliding off but the bottom half fit snug. the tie and waist seam didn't hit at my waist but the largest part of my middle. i tried other belts and it wasn't much better. the fabric and print were great. i love jumpers but this one went back.
other If you look closely at the photos, the buttons are only shown as applied halfway down the placket but the buttons run the entire length of this fabulous sweater by moth. the sweater fits tts; i am 5'5" 14other lbs and the m is just perfect with room to wear more than an average tight fitting tee underneath. it is a mid-weight nylon-viscose-cashmere knit with understated black cotton 'rope' snails on the pockets. there's nothing boring about it as is often the case with long-sleeved, navy blue cardig
other I couldn't wait to try this dress on when i first saw it featured. it is stunning! i love the red lace over-layed with a blue slip. it adds a fun color contrast to the piece. i am usually a size 6 in retailer clothing and found this one comfortably true to size. this dress has a very renaissance chic quality which is very feminine, flirty and unique. a great find for fall/winter parties. i can't wait to wear it!if i had to find a fault with this dress, it's the lack of pockets. retailer d
other Great shirt that runs true to size. i got the turqouise color which is very pretty. it cuts lower, but doesn't show much cleavage.
3 The outer layer runs large up top; also, the orange stitching (the flowers) on the outer layer are extremely bright orange rather then a fall brownish orange that would match the layer underneath. i'm returning it because for the price i don't love it.
other The fabric and its texture didn't meet my expectations unfortunately. there were too much fray and cast-off of edge yarns of a fabric... however this will fit if you wear over the swimming wears.
other Love this medium weight wool cape. it is so much prettier in person. the photos look a bit boring but this cape is very versatile and simple to wear. some capes hang oddly on me but this one was flattering without the bulk. not itchy either. the photos don't really show the sleeves clearly but there is a sleeve built into the cape. the taupe color is a rich neutral that can be paired with thin or thicker turtlenecks or shirts. the sleeves are bracelet length so full length sweaters will show und
other Love this skirt - it looks precisely as the photo depicts. the metallic stitching may be a little bothersome for some in terms of itching/scratching. i&#39;m 5&#39;8&quot; 135# and the 6 fit perfectly (pear/hourglass).
other I wish i had read the reviews prior to purchasing. this skirt looks amazing in photos and lace appears black. the lace on mine is actually purple - at first i thought it was just purple due to lighting with red underneath - but nope - pull the netting away and it is purple. lace netting hikes up on the right due to poor craftsmanship. i ordered a medium and felt it was a bit large. will return.
3 This dress was so lovely in person, but when i put it on...ooh la la! it is short! i am 5' 3" and i would not walk outside in this dress without something underneath. it just needed one more tier and i would have kept it for sure. too bad!
3 This is a cute dress, but just not a keeper for me. the top portion of the dress is fairly snug. i am normally a small in retailer sizes, but i would have sized up the keep the dress from pulling so much across the bust. otherwise, it was cute and simple, and the tulle was quite soft.i think that i would have gone with a medium, but i am wearing a small in the photo. for reference, i am 5'5", ~13other lbs, 34c, and 27" waist.
other I adore this top. it is super soft, drapes nicely, and looks great with a ton of different bottoms. i am 5'4", 10other lbs., and ordered this in both xs (my usual size), and s. i ended up keeping the s (most cloth & stone xs tops swim on me, so i was a little surprised), but glad i tried both. my only concern is how it will hold up after washing it. it is a gauze-like material, and i just hope i can get a long life out if this top.
other This is a beautiful blouse. very pretty and looks well made. unfortunately i had to send it back. i'm looking for a more classic cut. it has an a line/tent shape. when i put it on and put my arms above my head, the bottom of the blouse was up to my bra!i would order from this brand again.
other I want to live in this sweatshirt. it's so comfy, but also well-cut and lays nicely, not boxy at all. i'm typically a 10-1other or l in tops and the 3 is roomy without looking sloppy.
other Love these lightweight pants... they're beyond comfortable and the print is darling! hope this designer has additional pieces next season!
3 Got this on sale in black and red, and have only worn the black. quality is poor, seems to stretch out over the course of the day and loses its shape somewhat. a smaller size may keep its shape better so you may want to size down. not worth full price.
other Did want to love this jacket because i have so much black and white, but i saw it on my daughter and had to have it. i usually take a large, but i needed an extra large, and the fit is great. the material is not too heavy, so i know it can wear it year round by adjusting the weight of tee underneath.
other Beautiful sweater!! i love the color and the fit. the cowl neck isn't too tight and the sweater hangs away from the body without being boxy. it comes down to the low hip on me. very soft and cozy. i purchased the aqua in xs. fits perfectly and i'm 5" 5' 127lbs.
other When i saw that these were on sale, i was actually going to order another pair as i have really been enjoying them and wear them quite a bit. unfortunately, the large that i take is sold out otherwise i would own two pairs. although these are called lounge pants, i put them together with white or black accessories and have worn them everywhere. since my legs are not long, i did have to shorten and they are still a bit longer on me than the model. however, it was well worth it.
3 This model looks like a bauble head. she is absolutely too thin and sends the wrong message out to retailer shoppers. this last catalog's models are anorexic and unhealthy looking.i ordered this shirt hoping it would fit, but it's too small for 34dd. i am tall athletic and have breasts. i think of my shape as average - and the top didn't fit. it's cut narrow and small.
3 This runs small, i got the size 3 which fits like a medium, not a large. its a bit of an aline shaped knit in a beautiful saturated navy. i loved the elbow length sleeves. i have a large 34g bust and although this fit, it came to the top of my waist and i'm short-waisted. it's a great basic for someone less busty or who likes a shorter length.
3 I wanted to love this set, but sadly it just didn't fit as i had hoped. the small was bigger than expected and looked frumpy and not sexy. returned.
other This came in the mail today. i wasn't sure of my size, so i ordered a s & m. i tried on the small first and it fit perfect. i never tried on the medium. fyi, i'm 5'5", 12other lbs., & 34a in the chest. this jacket is a keeper.it is so soft & comfortable on; i love olive as it goes with everything; it can be super casual or dressier depending upon what you're wearing. i also like that it is collarless as that better allows for a wrapped scarf. i will use this jacket a lot.
other As always, these ag stevies are perfect. i was worried they would run small, but they are true to size on me. i'm about 5'2" and ordered the petite length and the length looks like the model on me. just above the ankles.
other The fabric quality and style are amazing. the fabric is very high quality and so soft and the style is nice for an adult. i generally don't wear shorts because of length, style and other problems but i can wear these without feeling like a high schooler. i usually wear a 24/00 in pants, i ordered the 0 and was worried that it would be too loose and look sloppy on me but it fits amazingly. one of my favorite purchases ever!!!
3 Thought i'd love this top; i'm a sucker for lace anything from retailer.  but i found the lace, while pretty, to be quite rough, which to me indicates a lower quality. and i guess i should've known that it would be very swingy (photos show that) but it really overwhelmed me.  for reference, 5'5", 12other lbs, 34d. sad, but this went back.
other This is the second sweater i've purchased recently that i overlooked online, but fell in love with once i tried it on. it is extremely flattering and the length is perfect. i will be wearing this a lot! i am 5'-7", 138 lbs. and the medium fit perfectly.
3 This piece is lovely if you do not plan to use your arms, or if you are a t-rex. if you are not a mannequin or a dinosaur and actually plan to use your arms, this top may not be for you.
other I love the quality of this little gem. it's going to be used as an under a sweater top and also to fill a v-neck line dress up that's too low for me. it's made very well in my opinion but it runs a bit too full so if you are between sizes you could easily go down a size.
other This dress is really cute, it's not a complete bag on you. i read that other reviewers complained about the fact that it is see-through. and that is the case, but i own multiple pairs of skin-toned underwear and did not find this to be a problem. the fabric is lightweight, but perfect for the summer. it does wrinkle, but a steamer is your best friend.
other Great print and material, but this top runs large. i'm 36c and usually wear l in most lines retailer carries, but this was just big. i reordered in a medium.
other Around other years ago, i bought other pairs of "daughters of the liberation" brand (very similar style) shorts at retailer, and have been repairing any and all frayed fabric in the first two pair, in a lighter material than the second two pair, ever since, in order to preserve my #other favorite shorts. thank goodness pilcro - another longtime fave brand of pants available at retailer - came through this year with these very similar, but perhaps even nicer, shorts. i bought the yellow striped pai
other I love these pants. they are a beautiful color and very well made. i like the fit and the style very much.
other I am almost always an xs in bottoms (sz 0-2) but literally couldn't get the stretchy waistband (no zip or fastening) in xs up my hips. in addition, the "brocade" is a very lightweight polyestery, tinselly weave--does not suggest quality. as others have noted, it also runs short; i'm 5'3'' and this was a little below knee length on me, not ankle-length. i've had luck with retailer's sale section in the past, including some items that didn't always start off with the best reviews, but have no regret
other This is a gorgeous sweater! i purchased it in black and purple.
3 I like this shirt, as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts. however, after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans. so: good if you don't like long t-shirts, bad if you are tall, like me (5'8") and don't want to wear a crop top.
other I am waist-challenged. i like a narrowly cut structured sheath dress, sort of like the 60s styles. this is a great dress either belted or loose with great accessories and lovely shoes. it has so many colors in the pattern, you can wear this with anything, and the fabric is so high-end and quality that you can definitely wear this to work with a jacket and then change into a denim or leather jacket and tough high boots and go out for the evening in the fall-winter. it arrived in the mail and righ
3 This is a beautiful and well-made top; sadly it just didn't work for me. i'm 5'other with a pretty short waist and even on me it was too short. the shortness might've worked if it wasn't as baggy as it was. i don't mind baggy, loose-fitting tops, but this was so much so that it was just unflattering; it looked a bit boxy as well.
other While i love this top ( beautiful color and pattern) i found it to be a bit short.  if it were a few inches longer i would be thrilled.  i'm 5'8 ,  curvy, and have a long torso-- so that may be the problem. i will say that within other hours of wearing this, i had other strangers stop me and comment re: how pretty it is. i am keeping it :)
other I could live in these jeans, they are so comfortable. they are have the perfect amount of stretch and the fabric is so soft. i was skeptical because that usually means they lose their shape and i'm yanking on them all day, however, i have worn them 3 days now and on the third day they may have stretched a little in the waist. i am normally a 28, but can get away with 27 sometimes; i chose the 28 and felt the fit was perfect. by the way, i'm wearing the jeans with the cubanas ciara glitter boots,
other I had this in my cart for a while online and ended up finding it in store. the medium fit good and looked great. i can't wait to wear it with a great pair of leggings. i did have to buy some static spray as it was sticking to my leggings i had on that day buying it.
other I bought the multi-color stripe and it is adorable! i am 5'9", 13other lbs and purchased a size small. it is a perfect length and drapes well...not too tight at all. i received a ton of compliments the first time i wore it. highly recommend!
other I loved this on the mannequin and assumed it would look terrible on me. i tried it on anyway and was delightfully surprised. i tried a small and it was too roomy in the top so i opted for the extra small. i'm 5'6" and 130 lbs, (27 in jeans, 34a). my booty definitely fills it out but the rest of the fit is similar to the model. it is hard to get on and off but if you tie a looser bow before slipping it over your head it's much easier to get back on and you can tighten it up again fairly easily. f
other Loved the colors but the fit was less to be desired. very wide under arms & too much material. looks more like a maternity dress. i ordered a small petite & would have needed the xs but now it is no longer available. oh well. returning this.
other Pilcros always fit perfectly and these jeans are no different. the style is great and a little different with the slits on the side. i bought the gold color which is a little brighter than pictured. for that reason, i'm on the fence about keeping them. i wish there were other bold colors to choose from since most of the other choices seem washed out.
other I originally got this for myself but it was just a little bit more snug than i liked. i ended up giving it to my daughter. it fits her nicely and she wore it to her holiday party at work and it was a hit!!
other This dress is gorgeous in person and very flattering, but i was surprised at the weight and i found the armholes, especially with the picot edge detail, too tight and a bit irritating. i do have a 3other dd bust, so i'm not sure if that was the problem, but i've never had that problem in any of the retailer dresses i've purchased in the last few years. (and there were a lot of them.) i tried on my regular petite small and that was the correct size.
other I ordered this online in red. i would definitely say this color is more of an orange-red. i like the weight and the cut. i keep wishing the material was a soft modal vs what it is. the ribbing up top does not bother me but it definitely does make it a casual dress. (which is what i wanted so i'm happy with it) it fits me nicely, the straps (for me) could be a hare shorter to fit perfectly. that being said, i'm 5'5" and have a thin build. small bust. i would say there is a some leeway for other s
3 I like how this jacket is very versatile. you can wear it to work, or play. it does have interesting detail on it, i kept it based on the price and those details. i have the olive color. the arms are a little tight.
other This a great skirt for someone with a straight or boyish figure. this skirt does not accommodate a curvy figure - small waist, feminine hips.
other I've been anticipating the arrival of these pants and was literally at the doorstep with ups. i have a birthday celebration visiting wineries and thought this would be the perfect outfit.it did not disappoint. fits like a glove....very flattering and comfy! i am 5"other and ordered a small petite. not too short, but still have the option of wearing sandals. i hesitated because of the price - but so worth it!!
other Fits great & super comfortable. i love this dress!
other Pretty color, but i was hoping for a thicker, higher quality material for the price. the material is lightweight and isn't tailored well. looks kind of sloppy.
other This dress is stretchy and soft, a great length, and an out of this world pattern. it will probably be flattering on every body, but it certain flattered mine.
other Great fit, very soft fabric, and the sleeves are long enough!! great length in the body too.
other This is an absolutely gorgeous dress. i have the arcata patchwork dress which fits beautifully without looking too full, but this one is just too voluminous. also, the bottom of the front yoke hits at a weird spot on my bust. this would be a great maternity dress or it would be perfect for a thin woman who can carry off the large amount of fabric. so disappointed, the fabric is beautiful and the colors are too. this can be worn year round, with sandals or boots.
other This top is soft feeling and i appreciate that it's lined. it's light weight and feminine, but no camisole is needed. when you take it off the shoulder area feels tight, so you need to be a little gentle but it's gorgeous and you should get it. i'm a 32c and i got a 2.
other I first bought the red & green at the store. when they went on sale bought the blue & ivory. love, love ,love these shirts! they go great with a skirt or jeans. so happy i got them. the fabric is stretchy, but still fits very nicely. what a great buy, hope to see more of this style again.
other This is awesome multi-season dress.
other I was a little bit afraid to purchase this because of the price, but i am so glad i did because this is a gorgeous swimsuit. the quality is amazing, and the colors are exactly as pictured. i have a small-ish frame with a big bust, and this style keeps my figure very flattering without making my chest look too big or heavy.
other I think this dress is my favorite purchase this whole year! it fits like a dream! i saw it in the store while it was full price and tried on an 8 (the only size they had left!). i typically wear a 6 or 8 in dresses, but the 8 was quite large, so i passed. after it went on sale, i ordered a 6 with my fingers crossed! glad i ordered when i did, as they sold out fast! fabric is a nice substantial weight, great for fall! the fit is great, not tight at all and more of an a-line on me, which is weird
other I love this vest! it's perfect for day and dress up for the evening. very comfy!
other I love this skirt! i feel in love with it in-store and when i couldn't stop thinking about it a few weeks later i knew i had to get it. beautifully made with high quality materials and so flattering! fits very well for my figure (big butt and hips w small waist, sits just below my belly button and accentuates my waist and slims my hips. must have!
other Great fun pattern. sexy styling. the other reviewers commented on how the trim is white and the body is ivory- i actually liked that. i am 5'4" and 120 lbs. i usually wear a other and ordered a medium in this suit. bottom was super small and is sold out in large so i had to return it
other I ordered this on a whim during the 40% discount upon sale price. i was a bit worried it looked like a burlap sack initially, but after trying it on with an under tank and leggings i decided it was a keeper. its quite soft and is flattering. i usually wear a medium, got the m/l and fits well.
other The color and pattern are so cute and fun. they are also very soft and comfortable. most important, these pants still keep everything covered when i bend into a forward fold.
other Love this sweatshirt! i'm 5'2" 110lbs and ordered the x-small. it's a little boxy but very comfy. it's definitely light peach in color and not pink, as shown. very happy with this purchase!
other Gorgeous dress. ordered the orange in an xs. i'm usually a small in retailer but the reviews accurately assessed this dress to run large. i'm 5'7" about 140lbs and this dress is just above my knee. very flattering and feminine. only issue is that the bottom is a thin material that can be see through in the right light...
other If you are shaped anything like me, you will have to size up quite a bit on this one. i tried it on in my normal size and probably needed to size up other or more sizes to get the proper fit. the fabric has no "give" and feels a little cheap in my opinion. for your reference, i am a curvy, athletic build with broad shoulders.
other I purchased all three colors! this sweater is gorgeous. i love it. it's made well, all three colors are beautiful and it fits great. it's definitely true to size. i'm thrilled with this sweater. adorable!
other This is the most perfect dress i've ever bought. i'm 5'8" and the length was perfect. the cut is flattering and very slimming. the fabric is gorgeous and the pattern is stunning. please offer more dresses in this cut!!
other The cream color in this dress is divine. such a stunning dress that can be worn with a vest, jacket or alone. it looks very luxe and expensive in the cream color. because it's a knit, can go smaller in size. i tried on both the x-small and small. opted to go with the x-small. found it fit better.
other The black band seemed to cut across the widest part of my hips, emphasizing them. the pants are sheer. the fabric was not comfortable against my skin. overall, the pants were a miss.
other I'm 5'5" 120 lbs and i bought these in a 0. they fit great. i wore them for upwards of 1other hours and i was very comfortable. i received compliments on the print and cut. very flattering.
other I am other feet and 120. i ordered a petite small in moss. i have posted a photo below. it's a pretty green. the lining is pretty. the reason i deducted a star is because the lining is very thin and "slips" a little when putting the jacket on. but it doesn't effect the way the jacket falls and i wear it comfortably. it's floppy, but not sloppy. i was surprised that each side the fabric is like a tulip. it was a nice surprise. i'm curvy and busty. i have zero problem with it being unflattering. the s
other This top wasn't an eye catcher off the bat but i love nothing more than a dressed up tee, so it's why it made it to the dressing room with me. it has elbow length sleeves, a slub texture, super soft, awesome texture and detail. the slight v-neck is perfect and the overall fit is great. i'm typically a lover of black but the wine color was gorgeous too so i took both into the fitting room with me (the other colors weren't available). surprisingly, the black was not even close to a favorite, but t
other Loved this dress. fit like a glove, so flattering, and perfect for a summer/fall wedding. material is substantial and dress is well made. i'm 5'4, large chest, and curvy, and a size 6 fit perfectly. longer than seen on the model for me, but i actually love it being tea-length. a strip of tulle attached to the lining underneath the skirt to help it "poof." i removed it, but looks good either way.
3 Wore this romper 1x and after washing, the hem on one of the shorts/legs completely unraveled. if i want to ever wear it again, i will have to bring it to a tailor to get fixed. unacceptable for a $200 product. cute design and good fit but questionable quality.
3 I ordered this top online in two colors, and kept the berry color. i liked it while trying it on. when i wore it an entire day, the top just didn't look that good. it wasn't flattering, and it focused on the bad areas despite being loose fitting. it didn't seem very flattering. i wore it for one day and am not happy with my purchase. i wish i could send it back but i already wore it. the fit just isn't very flattering. it is loose but focuses on the curves not in a good way if you are curvy.
other The inseam is advertised as 28", but they are more like 38". i was hoping they were for short people, but they are for someone with very long legs, event in my tallest heels, i'd have to get them hemmed! just a warning to my short friends out there. the quality, fit, look was great, but way way way too long.
other I've been looking for sometime for a spring/summer jacket to wear on warm days over light clothing. i wanted something feminine and just structured enough to move beyond casual. this fits the ticket! it is a very pale grey and a soft, cozy fabric. i am 5'8" tall and 118 lbs, and usually wear an xs in many items but a s in jackets due to the shoulders. these shoulders were large on me in the s. the waist was also large, but worth having it altered. if you find this on sale it's a great buy!
other I ordered an xs regular and it barely skims the floor when i'm wearing wedges or heels - perfect! it's form fitting but not clingy, and i think it's a pretty, comfortable dress. glad i made the purchase!
other Great skirt! i bought the red and paired it with a casual white button down. i feel like the top definitely needs to be short or tucked in for the look to work. i am typically a other in bottoms, and went with the small in this. the xs probably fits more like it's intended to, but it is very curve-hugging, and i was more comfortable with the looser fit of the small (especially since i am tucking in a blouse). there is stretch in the skirt, and the fabric has a nice feel.
3 Originally bought the plaid version and retuned it to order this one in the store to get free shipping. the fit is completely different. i am a consistent small, particularly in dresses of this style. will be exchanging this for a medium, which i hope will fit. love the color and pattern.
other Was super excited to try this on, but had to go up 3 sizes from my normal 6 and the waist was still too tight - i was swimming in the top as well. just a very strange cut and unflattering. such a bummer because it's so pretty.
3 The fabric and design are gorgeous so i was hoping the top would work for me. sadly, it looked ridiculous on me. i wouldn't recommend the top for busty girls. it looked like a bell on me. fyi, it doesn't come with a camisole underneath.
other This is a very soft and comfortable jacket but it has holes in the pocket area. it was returned to the store and the other jackets had the same problem although not in the same area. the store was considering pulling the product off their shelves. it is unclear if the holes are just the beginning of a pocket or what. but it was flawed by everyone who looked at it.
other I'm normally a small in retailer tops. i ordered a small, and the top fit well in the shoulders and in the upper (more fitted) part. it all went horribly wrong from there. the top billowed out at the bottom and fit like a circus tent, instantly adding a good 50 pounds to my frame. this was such a disappointment, as the pattern is beautiful and the fabric is high quality.
other This dress has pretty colors. the top fit well but the bottom looked like an upside down umbrella. it has enough material to make other skirts and the big pockets on the sides make the skirt stick out sideways. the photo of model is from side, not the front. very unflattering on me.
other Love this dress !!
3 Still can't decide if i want to keep this. it's super comfortable but much thinner than expected and the color seems more navy blue than black.
other This is a beautiful dress. figure-hugging but covered up in places that need it. color is flattering and soft. wore with bainbridge layered necklace. bought for an afternoon function and wore with pumps. so versatile, will work for church or cocktail party.great purchase!
other Pretty fabric, nice style, took it back.
other I love the flower patterns. they add feminine touch. this legging is well made with good quality spandex. the only cons is the color is not as deep as the picture. when you wearing it and the fabric stretched, the color looks much lighter. other than that, it's a good buy!
other It is rare that i find a pair of pants that works for me at retailer. as a woman with curves i have found that most of retailer's pants are cut for slim figured women, this rare pair of pants crosses the divide, flattering both shapes. i usually have to look for xls. here, i found that i had too much room and sized down to a l. these pants are great. they are lightweight without being so gauzy that they highlight imperfections. they will be my go to summer pant. i love them.
other Easy to wear and very cute, especially for curvy ladies. but, i think it looks best worn with a best, or a blazer on top, something to emphasize the waist a bit more.
other I'm always nervous about length on ponchos, and this one was perfect (fit like the model and i am 5'7"). it is definitely a thin/semi-sheer knit, but it looks so classy and elegant with a black long sleeve under it and jeans. i love that this doesn't require dry cleaning and makes me look put-together for an easy day to night look. i'm 2other weeks pregnant and love that this works now and later :) very happy with this purchase!
3 I usually follow the boho look, and this dress appealed to me immediately and it was in the color i wanted black. so excited to receive this as i knew i could wear it both as a dress and a tunic but that was not to be.the outfit consists of other elements: a tight fitting slip that fits awkwardly and does not give enough room in the bust nor waist areas, and an overlay dress that is really quite pretty. but it too was too tight across the bust area which made the entire upper torso ill fitting.i n
other This is a pretty tunic/dress that looks and fits exactly as shown. i imagine that it would be quite long on anyone under 5'5" or so, since it falls maybe other inches above the knee on me at 5'7". it's cute, and an easy throw on and go piece. the quality is even good. i decided to return it though because it felt a little plain for the price...maybe if it were more exciting colors or patterns? a slightly more fitted cut? i couldn't place my finger on the exact thing that wasn't clicking for me, but
other I love this dress, it is so comfortable and elegant at the same time. i try to not buy dry clean only pieces, but i had to make an exception here!! perfect for early spring days.
other I&#39;m 5&#39;3&quot; 118 lbs and the 26 navy fit great.  the gray i can hardly button and are less flattering.  i will order another size 26 in gray to see if it will fit better, but also try a 27.
other This is one of my favorite pair of pants. they don't stretch out while wearing and wash well. no pilling or shrinking. they can either be worn like leggings or pants. i wear a size other pants but got these in a 27 because i don't like them super fitted.
other Love this dress. it's a nice addition to my summer wardrobe. easy to wear. i am between a large and an ex large in dresses. i did order it in a large, it was a perfect fit but did exchange it for an ex large. i wanted it to have little more swing to it.
3 I love this sweater, so why a lower rating? while i love the material and the color, it lost all of its shape before i even left the house! i am a size 6 / small and it looked clownish on me before i ever got to my dinner party.  i plan to wash it this evening and i really hope that this brings it back to its original shape and keeps it.
other This jacket is really cute! however, the mesh is really fragile. i've had the jacket for a month and noticed a huge tear down the back shoulder. it doesn't fit me tight so i'm not sure how it happened. every time i wear it i'm super paranoid about snagging it on something. like i mentioned before, the jacket is cute. it's lightweight and the design is unique. but if you want to get more than an occasional wearing out of this then don't bother. i'm hoping i can return it otherwise that's a lot of
other This is the first romper i've ever purchased and i'm instantly in love. it's flows, the colors are vibrant and the pockets are practical. looking forward to wearing it for the rest of the season as well as next year.
other Hadn't really looked at this dress till i saw it in person in the store. so i tried it on. i'm only 5'other and 140 lb. busty on top so i tried the 8. it was a smidge snug, decided since the dress has no give to go with a 10. would have liked this in a petite for the shorter length, but it's back ordered till august and i really wanted to take it with me on vacation. its just above my ankles in regular length, which will work and i can up the score with some wedges. this dress fits like a dream and
other Love the distressed look and linen-like texture. the back ties cinch in for a custom fit & the knit hood is a nice touch. the length is great! fits tts (exactly as depicted) if not slightly roomy, which i like. absolutely fabulous!
other Easy to wear! cute, comfy...will be a go to for summer.
other These pants are so soft and stretchy they feel like leggings. i love the ankle length as they are perfect to wear with both flats and booties. i am 5'5" with fairly long legs and these hit right at my ankle. they are so comfortable i have ordered in the green, red and gray. my "go to" pants this winter.
3 I was quite excited to find this tee in the store. the design looked interesting and it seemed nice on the mannequin. the bright red color really stood out in person. i am 5'2", 34b, tried on my usual size s and it was humongous! although the sales lady found a size xs (they don't have size xxs available in the store) for me to try on, it was still huge like a tent. it probably would fit better for a tall body figure. i would recommend those who are interested in this tee to try it in the store,
other I like this sleeveless sweater - it adds warmth and visual interest without adding a lot of bulk. paired with black/white patterns it's pretty versatile (as seen in the pics) - a great staple for a more casual office environment. being a taller girl i love the length on it, and find it's flattering for my curvy figure.
other I bought the silvery blue tunic. it is very light grey with a hint of blue. it is so shapely - coverage without being boxy or maternity-like. it covers your bum perfectly and looks great with a dark pair of skinny jeans. the color can really take you through autumn, winter and even spring depending on where you live. i love the sleeve length, too.
3 Great jeans by pilcro, too short and snug around my knees for keeping though.
other This top is so pretty and festive. i am purchasing it for a holiday party. i debated between a m and l, but went with the m, and i'm glad i did. it is generously sized. finding bottoms for it has been a little tricky. i'm thinking i will try the velvet pants as shown.
other This is a wonderful, cheerful spring dress. the material is slightly thicker than expected. (i suppose i thought it would be a little thinner or more summery, but it really works for both seasons.). the fit is exactly spot on as i would expect for tracy reese. i'm 5'2", 110, 32-24.4-32, and ordered the 0p. colors and fit are just like the product photo. highly recommended.
other I received so many compliments on these pants! these are not only classic, they fit amazing...look great with heels and/or booties. match both black and brown.
other The photo misrepresents how large this sweater is. it is giant! petite ladies stay away from this sweater. i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs, but this just floored me. the neckline wouldn't even stay up on my upper body, it was that loose. also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model. it is like a tent. i'm so bummed. the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft. it's too bad it doesn't fit smaller women.
other I bought this dress as a consolation prize when another dress i wanted didn't suit me. i was shocked by how flattering it was, because on the hanger it was just "meh". the material is soft jersey, heathered, and it hangs well. it has a simple lining, but that doesn't interfere with the fit. it is a little low for my personal taste, so i wear a cami or scarf, but for those less well endowed, you'd probably be fine without one. for the record, i typically wear a 2-4, 12other pounds, 5'8, and 3other ddd br
other This sweater was exactly what i was looking for...something well made, cozy, easy to just throw on and go and still look chic. i am 5'3" and 110 lbs and the x-small fit perfectly - still roomy but drapes well. i got the taupe which is nice but i got the red color for my sister in law and its gorgeous- more of a burnt orange than the red show here. i would definitely recommend this sweater!
3 Gorgeous but just too short in length for anyone with a long torso.  i sized up to get more length, but then the neck opening was way too big and hung open to expose - well, everything up top.  wearing a cami would be an option but would take away from the dressiness of the top.  i had to leave without this item, but was disappointed because i love the colors and cut otherwise!
other I got this dress and think it's just great. it's a bit formal, but a bit whimsical at the same time. i really disagree with others said about the opening along the arms. i think they are barely noticeable but are nice surprise. this is a perfect california winter dress. i could see how a woman in colder parts of the country might not appreciate the slits on the arms but i think it's nice to show a little skin in a conservative way. i plan to wear it to a classical music concert soon. and i got i
other I love this item! i'll wear it as a cover up or to dress up and go out. the material is great for summer- light and breathes. i first ordered a small because the medium was sold out. it fit too high-water. i then ordered the large and it fits great. the medium may have been fine too. i'm 5'4", 145.
other These pants are my favorite! not only is the fit slimming and perfect, but i get compliments on the design every single time i wear them. i absolutely love these, well worth the money.
other Beware. white is not white. white is more cream, off-white, light beige. i was really looking forward to these shorts but was immediately disappointed when i saw the color. they are cute, but not white. i bought them to wear with the nautical look tops for this summer, but unfortunately, creamy colored shorts don't do much for navy/white tops.also, the button is very difficult to open/close.otherwise they are ok.
other ...but it does have it's problems. the neck, although it has pretty button detail at the back, is very outsized on me. i would like to see it fit a bit more snugly as by not laying flat, necklaces bunch up and are hard to wear with it. it is just sort of 'floppy' if i'm making sense. the camisole liner is nicely made and attaches with snaps at the shoulders which gives this a definite plus. the fabric is sort of like chiffon with appliquã©d flowers. the color combination is beautiful and with the
other This dress is so cute and unique. i got many compliments when i wore it to an event recently and i know it will be a great summer dress. it definitely runs small and short on me. i am usually a 2/other and needed a 6 in this dress.
other I love these jeans and want to keep them but they are so long! im 5'7 and they wrap all the way under my feet so i cant even have them altered because it would cut the flare out. its kind of crazy how long they are.
3 So many things to love: love the mod kind of style, the forgiving pleats and empire waist and the fabric quality. but the neckline is just way too deep. if they didn't pin the one on the model, i'm a monkey's uncle. that super low neckline takes what should be a nice day dress and turns it into something you can't really wear in a church or in front of your dad. i seriously considered altering it, but the waist is already so high, i felt it would ruin the line of the dress.
3 Looks great on the model, but if you're curvy it looks very frumpy.
other This coat is fun, flirty, & flattering. i bought it strictly for how good it looks on - it's not a coat for warmth. the top is tailored and fitted, but the bottom is very full and swings. (there is a lot of fabric on the bottom). i'm not sure why some people had a hard time with the sleeves - i do not have the smallest arms and this was not an issue for me. however, i had a very thin shirt underneath the coat and that is all you can fit under it, so keep that in mind. the small fit me perfect. v
other These run at least other sizes smaller than other styles of the same brand, mother. such a bummer because the quality is totally on point. i'm going to exchange them for a huge size i guess. whatever, i don't mind having a size that's so much larger than all my other jeans. i just mind the complete hassle of the exchange process. i wish mother would get their sizing issues under control. it's not retailer's fault. so annoyed.
other I knew i had to have this shirt when i saw it online. the embroidery is almost like english smocking. i was not disappointed when i opened my package. the only flaw i've noticed is that it does "pucker" slightly around the shoulders and chest area due to the tight embroidery not allowing it to stretch. it is not terribly noticeable though. lovely shirt all around.
other I tried this dress on in the store in the mango color but opted to order the blue. the dress is beautifully made and the fit is fantastic.
other Comfortable, cool-perfect summer tank. ordered  one for my daughter(small), had to get myself one too(medium)-both tts. great for errand runs, around house, lounging, sleeping. seems better made than more expensive tops ordered as of late. good job retailer
other I agree with everything the other reviewer stated. this top is very billowy and runs large, it would be nice if i didn't have a chest! the other issue with this top is the macrame detailing is made more out of a satin like material and i wanted it to look closer to natural raw fiber. the pink is slightly more pink in person but it's not that far off. had to return.
other I love this top! i was thinking that i was going to need a x-large because i'm very "busty". i tried it on at the store, and the large was perfect! it's comfortable and flattering. not boxy at all. i bought it in plum and white. the plum is more a wine color than a purple, which i prefer. the buttons are beautiful, but i couldn't see myself buttoning and unbuttoning all of them, since they don't slide out of the buttonholes easily. but i had no trouble slipping it over my head with just a fe
other Great top!! love the fit, it pairs great with dark denim and pearls!! i ordered a 00 and am a 32c cup and 24-2other waist
other Cozy, soft fabric.  love the snails on the pockets and the cute buttons.  size down if you want a more tailored fit.
other I bought this in a petite size s after trying on the regular size in the store. it was a good move because the proportions in length and width are more flattering. the pattern is busy but works well with patterns in the same color group. it has no finished seams on any edge but that makes it drape nicely. it is a soft, soft fabric, almost fleece-like but not plush.
other This is a beautiful dress and i would recommend.but it was short on me (tall), not the midi i was hoping for. and a little too low cut (too much cleavage), i'm a d cup.since i paid full price, i have to be completely pleased with my purchase, for this reason i will return. maybe if i had bought it on sale price, then i would keep.
3 This is a lovely dress that i would consider to purchase if the dress is lined and the key hole is not deep. tts
other This dress is an absolute win. i was won over on the hanger by the linen fabric's lightweight nature, and then i tried it on. such a good fit for my high waist, and the tie was super flattering. i love this with booties as i was wearing today, but think it will be adorable with espadrilles as well for a more summery look. it's also the rare three season dress, with its cut and coloring working most of the year.  for sizing, i'd say it's true to size. i got my regular size s with no trouble with
other So first off, yes, these are almost mind-numbingly expensive. however, i think the design and quality are absolutely there. the label "low-rise" always makes me wary (as someone who is curvy, low rise often = muffin top danger and bad early 2000s flashbacks), but the low rise design of these is actually great. they are mainly low rise in the front, angling down slightly toward the button, and in the back they are, not super high, but more of a mid rise, so you won't have to be really careful ben
other Adorable fit. the lightweight madras fabric will be perfect for a hot summer day but not see-through. the slightly gathered bottom makes gives my petite frame a taller look. easy to wear, not fussy, no special bra needed.
other Cute and perhaps a little too innocent for my age because the petite was too high and wide on me.  fits great on my shoulders/chest and the flare can be controlled with a layer and belt.  i already have a few ivory lace dresses that look age appropriate first try.  i don't think i have the right personality for this one.  looks great on everyone else i've seen wearing it!
3 This dress is a good casual summer dress. the material is thin and feels nice on. the dress was very wrinkled when it arrived but that came out very easily and the fabric doesn't really wrinkle easily after initial wash and steam. the color is very vibrant and the fit is loose. however, if you have a larger chest (i'm a 34c), the hook and eye closure dones come undone. overall a good purchase. it looks good with a belt as well.
other Very cute, very comfortable. for me aesthetics and comfort must go hand in hand. this dress fits the bill.
other I love this cardigan. it's quite luxurious and roomy and long in the front, leaving lots to wrap around yourself. the back is more croppedand slim fitting to help balance. this is so soft and warm, i love it. definitely bulky and cozy, not fitted. but perfect for a casual look. i'm usually a medium in sweaters but got a small in this, and it's still a little loose which is perfect.
other This dress is beautifully tailored and so flattering. i feel very comfortable wearing it to work because of the sleeves and neckline, but think it would also be good to wear out. i'm so happy i bought it.
other Nice, flowy, comfy top with soft fabric. there's a lot of fabric below the waist - it could probably work as a maternity top - but it drapes nicely rather than looking overwhelming. i do find that the buttons gap a little at the chest, despite the top fitting loosely on me, so i have to wear a layer under it.
3 I really wanted to love this tank top.  it has vibrant colors and a unique pattern; however, i should have listened to the reviews.  there was way too much fabric!  it made me look pregnant!  the tank top is going to be returned.
other This is a great looking top in person. i've worn this with jeans or skirts for different looks and it's cute both ways. i would order a size up though as it is not a flexible fabric so the shoulders/chest area need a little room to move comfortably.
other Great fit and quality. i'm 5'3" and 130 lbs, size other fit perfectly. bought both the blue and black. could definitely dress up or down!
other I love the weight of this dress, the mod color blocking, the pockets, the detail down the side of the skirt, the cable knit, everything! i wear it with a caramel cardigan and brown booties, it's perfect. it's a sin to pass it up, especially for this price.
other I bought this dress for my bridal shower and it is perfect. the pattern is beautiful and very similar to the image shown online. the fabric is much lighter than i anticipated which is nice for spring/summer weather. i had to get the top altered slightly to better fit on top but it was a very easy alteration. i am normally a size 8 in dresses and found this to fit very true to size.
other I love the look of this dress but wish the bottom was lined like the top is. it's a little sheer without the lining.
other These bottoms are comfortable, soft and fit perfectly. the pattern is exactly the colors online.
other I love, love, love this dress! it fits perfectly! it is comfortable and can be dressed up or down. i get compliments on it every time i wear it!
other Love the subtle pattern, i think it will be great for a number of occasions. the fit is very flattering. not lined, but high quality heavyweight fabric does not seem to make it necessary.
other Super comfortable and flattering casual jeans. i'm 120 lbs 5'7 normally size 26 and the 26 fit perfect.
other Love the dress, a little cheaply made but overall, it fits nice and will be great next fall. it will show tummy shape so if you do not have a flat tummy, this may not be the dress for you.
other I wanted to like this top, as the fabric was nice and thick, but found that it dipped too low beneath the armpits, which would be ok if your lats are in perfect shape, but i've always found that cut made mine look a bit saggy (and i'm not heavy). not great enough to keep in my opinion.
other The material is so soft and i really like the design (i got the map one). as others mentioned, sleeves are quite short, almost morel like a muscle tee than a t-shirt, but i don't mind. looks really cute under a cardigan for fall too.
3 This dress is pretty and is somewhat fitted in the bodice. it does have an a-line fit in the skirt. the stitching is beautiful. honestly the stitching was a little too bright for me. some may like that, but i was hoping for a little more toned down or muted. the colors are so vibrant in my opinion it almost cheapens the dress. the fabric is cotton and it is not lined. i am 5'9" and it does hit right about where it does on the model. i am sending it back, because i didn't say "wow, i love this" w
other This blouse is so much cuter in person! and it's more golden than yellow so it's not as bright which makes it easier for blondes to wear. i tried it on thinking i'd never be able to pull the color off but loved it enough to try, and wow so perfect! i had to get it and it was on sale. love this and happy to add it to my antro collection!
other What a pleasant surprise! hugs in all the right places and a nice substantial material!
other The design/pattern balances broader shoulders/narrower hips and gives my straighter waist definition.at 5'1", size other ended mid-knee, but overall felt a little too long (torso length). i normally take 0p or 00p in retailer dresses.i like the feel of the fabric and the overall playful yet chic look.
other Beautiful. did not look like much on the hanger, but this is a beauty. give it a try!i am 5'10; normally a size 6 and the small fits perfectly. it should be loose fitting, with a dropped, not so obvious flounce. the colors are subtle and it will go nicely with many lightweight summer pants and shorts!
3 Love the colors in this top. it's a shame it was so big and baggy i'm not that big a person but really made me look big and frumpy . i am 5'6", 130#. athlete. size small was way too much material for my frame
other I loved this t-shirt. i got the grey one in small. i'm a size other and 5'3. it is a relaxed fit. i love it because it is a bit different and the flowers add a nice flair. i didn't want t plan t shirt but i also didn't want anything too crazy. fits well and is soft too.
other I love quirky and unique sweaters/ cardigans, and this is no exception. it's not obvious in the photo (at least it wasn't for me), but the cardigan does have buttons all the way down, and not just at the top, something i appreciated. those buttons, however, are not easy to un-button. the snails are adorable without being childish. i'm 5'other 130lbs, often between a small and medium when it comes to cardigans. i chose the medium for this one, which fit exactly how i wanted it to (a.k.a. sleeves were
other Just got these and love them. the blue color is a great bright shade without being too crazy and they fit well. i'm 5'7" 138# straight build and ordered 27 (true to size for me.) they have loosened up throughout the day and the waist and hips are a bit baggy now but i like that they're not ultra-tight. nice light fabric for the summer.
other I made the mistake of ordering a medium instead of large and have the same fit issues as other reviewers. it is tight in the back through the shoulders, so if you're considering it i would stick with your larger of your size range. the print is beautiful as is the fabric. it looked okay on me from the side but i am short waisted. it fell at the perfect length on me too. there's just something about the fit that didn't wow me so i don't plan to reorder, but i do think it would be lovely on thinne
other This is so cute and i love that it is not heavy or bulky.
other Beautiful print. agree with other reviewers that the small snap at the bust is inadequate for anyone with a d or greater bust size. the dress was a perfect length on me with heels - even after i kicked off my heels i didn't find it too long like other reviewers. wind does open op the front so i may get it altered so it's no longer a true wrap dress
other Some quick notes- it is not sheer, like a previous poster was asking. there is a lining. the color is darker than it appears online, which was ok with me. i thought it still looked nice as a deeper gold. i was excited about this top, and thought it was the perfect thing for a casual/festive company holiday party. i ordered a m, and am usually between m and s in most retailer items. unfortunately it fit me rather boxy and short. i have a larger bust (30g) and it draped in a very unflattering way. m
3 I would have to wear a camisole underneath this, which is odd considering it's still two layered in the front. i wanted an easy white shirt to wear, not something i'd have to layer.
other I tried on areturn at my store, size 26 (i am often a 2other in jeans) - because these are tighter fit, teh 26 was fine. length was long though, but fit comfortably and looked nice. the cutout was at my knee, which bothered me a tad (model, seems a bit above the knee). i decided not to purchase them as i found another pair i liekd better, but if you are taller and are looking for a distressed skinny, these are great. (i am 11other lbs and have thighs ad butt form working out)
other Was hoping i was going to love this top and i did. its a fun piece to dress up or down.
other I really wanted to love this dress, but i think the proportions are very weird. i'm 5'7" and usually go for an eight in unstructured dresses and a 10 in more structured dresses.it runs small throughout, and is too short for me to feel comfortable wearing to work. the front is nicely detailed, but the back looks weirdly forgotten and could use more detailing. i tried on three different sizes (8,10,and 12) and they all pulled weirdly at the chest. there's a little slip that goes with the dress, w
other This is my favorite shirt to wear around the house. it's so soft and the waffle texture looks nice, i'd definitely wear it for a run to the store or an evening walk around the neighborhood. the fabric is thin but isn't too delicate and it's not sheer, which makes it a great summer lounge shirt. the cut is flattering and the back doesn't show my bra, which too many of this design do. it is a bit large, you may want to size down if you want it to be a bit more body conscious.
other I love white for summer and by august i am tired of wearing sleeveless...so this caught my eye. it is very easy to wear and pretty on. i wore it with black tie up shoes and accessories. super comfy & stylish.
other I really wanted to love this dress, but even though i got a small, it was still too big. i also don't think the horizontal pattern was a good look for me, other than that, it is beautiful and the fabric felt nice.
other This is a wonderful one-piece swim suit! it's very flattering on, and the colors and design are just lovely. i also love the suit's vintage feel and that it's sexy without being overly revealing. i seldom pay full price for clothing, but this item is definitely worth every penny!!! i bought a size medium and it fit perfectly.
other I made the mistake of ordering without checking the reviews. cute design but not as comfy as it looks. returned immediately.
other As another review said, the model's pose doesn't do this dress justice and i can't believe this is on sale. i picked this up this weekend at my local store. it fits wonderfully, very flattering. the fabric feels good and i'm fairly certain won't wrinkle too easily which is going to make this the perfect dress for packing for a trip. dress it up with boots for dinner, dress it down with sandals for day. this is a steal, get it! (i'm 5'8", ~145, the size 8 fit perfect)
other The dress is just ok. i cannot imagine having paid full price for this. i got it for florida vacation. i put it on to wear to church first and spilled a drop of lavender oil on it and it stained!!!! cant get it out. thats punk for a dress that even on sale is like. sending back
other I ordered this because it looked to be a good fit for my casual lifestyle. and it doesn't disappoint! it's cozy, lightweight but warm, flows well and looks great tied or worn loose. i ordered my regular size large in the grey. it fits as shown, just a bit longer because i'm short. the color is more of a blue gray with white striations that are well placed. it's really striking for such a casual piece. very pretty. highly recommend.
other Classic design with nice details. stays in place for those active bikini wearers.
other I had been looking for an off the shoulder top (or open shoulder) as the trend is really in right now, but that proves more difficult for me (muscular traps and shoulders, not always flattering)... anyway, i decided to order this ( i saw it paired with a wide-leg jeans, tucked in)... that is how i like it... tucked in. it is otherwise a little boxy on me (wide shoulders means the whole thing shifts out. the fabric si a tiny bit wrinkle-prone, but not too badly. both colors are nice, but thought
3 Beautiful victorian look blouse. runs large and overly blousy on me.
other This tunic is true to size, i ordered the xxs as i am 5'5", 110 lbs. it fit perfectly and hit me about other inches above the knee. similar to model photo (i have long torso). it has a very sparingly done cluster of sparkle sequence. the draw string waist has a tie on each side to adjust length. i actually returned it only because it seemed a little to young a look for me. i was sorry to do so.
other Like other reviewers, when i saw this top in person i was struck by it. i would never have even looked twice at it online. i hardly ever buy things at full price from retailer but i treated myself to this one. the only thing i'd disagree with is that it runs true to size. at my store, there was only other left (in a size 10). i'm usually a 4/6 but i figured i'd try it on since the style is loose anyway. and the 10 fit very nicely. i did try a 6 in another store and found the slits came too high and th
other When i saw this item online, i ordered it right away. loved the color and the oversized, comfy look to it. the pros: very soft,the color a deep cranberry as pictured. the cons; the low back - in the photo, the model's arms cover it up. when i put it on, it looked like an oversized flap that stuck out on the sides and was very visible from the front -- and because the material is unstructured, that made it look worse. i loved it except for this one feature, but because it was so detracting, i had
other I love this top it is cute with shorts, capris and jeans. it's really comfortable but looks put together and stylish.  great for running errands to drinks with the girls. a good transition piece into fall with a light cardigan.
other I love this top, i dress it up when i need to be more professional and i dress it down with a pair of cutoffs when it's warm. it is delicate, however, so i try not to wash it too frequently. the front is a bit boxy, which the model demonstrates. the model really encompasses the crisp whiteness of the shirt, the flow of it and the length.
other I thought it was only me and immediately assumed i needed to go on a diet when i attempted to put this adorable skirt on. it got stuck at my hips. i'm a very consistent size small in dresses and skirts. i actually thought about putting it on over my head but that was impossible. its going back. now i see the other reviews and am relieved that its the skirt and not me! wish i had read them before purchasing. retailer is going to get a lot of returns on this one.
other Rompers are my fav so i'm biased writing this review. although they are a little tricky with the fit i definitely can say that this beauty makes my body look amazing! the cut of the fabric makes for a great shape. yes, the first couple of buttons  are tough to get on but i'm guessing that after a couple of wears it will get easier. i got my usual size other and it fit like it was made specifically for me. i'm very happy with this purchase.
other Unless you have the body of the model - tall and very thin and wear a really small size - don't even think about getting this dress! it's literally a heavy sack. it hit right above my knee in the front and basically mid-calf in the back. the material is nice but it's an awful shape!
other Not only is this dress incredibly comfortable, but it can be accessorized for any occasion. i jazzed it up for a wedding, but a cardigan and flats also makes it easy saturday perfect. only way this dress could be improved.... pockets.
other These are simply the best of everything i love about charlie trousers. great fit, classic styling with the pop of the unexpected. the fabric is thinner than it appears--perfect for spring and summer. the pattern of the damask is not overwhelming, but it works very well as a neutral if you want to mix patterns (which i do a lot), or if you want to pair it with an ivory blouse and a simple blue sweater or jacket.. roll down the pants for a more professional look during the day, roll them up for ca
other T.la got it right this time. love the fabric. the color is perfect for summer and the color is a great shade of green. exactly as pictured. the left side has a slight cut with silver buttons. exactly as it looks on line. i certainly recommend this top. love it.
other This tunic trumped any other i have seen this season. the style, with the delicate open stitchwork around the upper chest gave it quite a feminine appeal. i especially love the weight of the fabric being on the light side. won't have to worry about hot flashes like when wearing a thicker fabric! it's warm without being bulky. and to top it off, it was on sale and i was able to grab two colors. this tunic is also age appropriate and flattering for most anyone. extraordinary to say the least.
other Way too much fabric; sticks out like jodhpurs but from the hip - eek! might be a great dress in rayon or a drapey fabric, but the extra fabric just piles up on itself... the outer layer also doesn't feel like it will breath. add the cotton lining, and i think it will feel miserable in the heat of the texas summer. returning.
other And hits below my waist just far enough to make my thighs look enormous. i think how it fits depends alot on body type. the material is nice, color pretty, not cheap looking so i will keep it but must wear a topper to slim down thise ugly thighs of mine.....
other Uncomfortable in the leg area, but otherwise very flattering.
other There are darts that are not shown in this picture that make the dress ill fitted. not sure why they are not in the picture and on the dress. i wish the pictures shown were more accurate.
other This is a gorgeous high quality blouse. the color is stunning in person; i don't have anything like this color in my wardrobe. i'm an xl in retailer tops, and purchased this blouse in a 16. i am busty but the top still fit well. i have large upper arms but the sleeves fit fine; i wish they were a bit looser but that is my personal preference and probably doesn't apply to most people. if you're very thin and not busty you might be able to size down, but i'm honestly just not sure. i'm happy to say
other This dress is great but extremely short. i'm 5'6" wear a size 4/6. the 6 looked like a tunic on me it was so short.
other Maeve really keeps me guessing on sizing...usually too big, but this one is too small in my normal 4, so i went with the 6 for comfortable movement while still maintaining the intentional fitted look. fabric is of beautiful quality, colors are true to the picture - just a gorgeous timeless dress that i imagine wearing to many special events, or with a denim jacket over it for work :)
other This dress is stunning. it is beautifully made with laces and beading in a way that is art. it fits in a very flattering and comfortable way. i think is would flatter any body type. the details are captivating and it immediately grabs the spotlight when you walk into a room.i ordered online and when it arrived i was stunned with it's exotic use of fabrics, textures.....a rare find and a must have.
other Absolutely love the jacket! wore it out in nyc at a rooftop bar and many people complimented on it. the faux fur is soft and pink color is beautiful. it is trendy but classy and can be worn dressy or dressed down with boyfriend jeans and booties. perfect transitional jacket from day to night =-)
other High quality, soft, thick fabric that drapes well, keeps you warm, and figure flattering. i'm 5'other and the length is perfect. the color is a great neutral that goes well with everything. love the design detail throughout. this cardigan does not have a button or tie closure so if you are between sizes, go with the smaller size for a tailored fit.
other Love the cutouts and embroidered detail of this top. it swings away from the body due to the crisp cotton drape. perfect for summer!
other Great fit i'm petite and bought size 29. my hips and waist differ by 10", so i'm very curvy. i love the fit and look just by rolling them up. my 1st pair of ag jeans and i will definitely buy more.
other These socks feel amazing-i have them in both colors.you would be surprised at the softness of these socks, yet they are slightly thicker than normal dress socks. i have weird toenails that tend to pierce through the tops of socks so a thicker sock is something that is very attractive to me. i feel like these would last a long time, with the bonus of making my feet feel like they are at the spa-these socks are soft?these socks do not stay on my thigh so i have to use a garter and wear them li
other This jacket is a real treasure and i could never have seen how substantial the embroidery is from the photo. also from the pic the jacket looks like a thin cotton, but on the contrary it is a wonderful weight with a feel like denim. the embroidery is a wonderful texture like heavy string or thin rope so it really has dimension... . i loved it so much i got the sweatshirt also by the same designer. can't wait until cooler weather so i may live in it! also when you have it on for a bit it seems to
other Tried and bought this in the store! loved it. my normal size other worked great. little word to the wise, be careful zipping it up, which is a little tricky. the first one i grabbed had a broken zipper. just takes a little work getting it up bc the fabric is thicker.
other I love the color of this top but the style is not flattering. i normally wear a l or xl in retailer clothes and i ordered a l in this and it was massive! i went into the store to try on a medium and it fit much better but is still very bulky around the middle where the ruffles are and it is very wide. bummer
other Very cute dress! 5'4, 120 lbs - xs regular was too long, xs petite was perfect length!
3 This was going to be my go to top. i loved the look of the billowy shirt, especially in light blue. when it arrived, i knew it wouldn't work for my body. i'm athletic build with muscular upper arms and a d cup. i tried it on anyway. i really wish it fit. it was snug in the upper arms and pulled a bit in the front. i knew if i ordered a size up the arms would still be tight. it's just the cut of the shirt. this top is best for someone that isn't busty and has slender upper arms.
other I bought a 2p when i should've bought a 0p. i was swimming in the 2p. however, it didn't matter, because everything was itchy, and i'm not even allergic to wool. the beautiful buttons are oddly placed to achieve that cool design, and just like other reviewers commented, you have to twist and contort them to get them to button...which, inevitably, will lead to them popping off. and i didn't see an extra one in case that happened. the coat is stunning, there's no argument about that, and i welcome
other This romantic top has lovely embroidery and beading details. i purchased this in purple, which is actually more of a cranberry color. i like that the detail work carries over to the back on the cap sleeves.
other This swimsuit is super cute and retro. the ruching on the stomach is very flattering and the shaping on the padded cups makes for a very nice hourglass 1950s-inspired look. great for us ladies without a lot up top. i felt very marilyn monroe in this suit! i love the back coverage, too -- your butt doesn't hang out of the suit and the boyshort style offers a good amount of coverage without being dowdy.i was worried about sizing when i first ordered it. based on what everyone said, i went with a
other I actually like my shirt more than the other reviewers it seems. i am little (5'1" and 103) and i don't think it's too boxy at all. i like the way it hangs. and i'll say i like it much more in person than on the model. it's somehow cozier than it looks in the picture. it's a real boosh (that mean's comfy.) i wouldn't have picked it from the online pic, but in person, it really caught my eye.
other Lovely! at 5'6", 34a-28/29-36, the size small was a great fit. moss color is really quite grey. drapes beautifully and is an easy wear.
other I ordered the shirt bc it looked soo cute despite the fact many said this shirt was see thru. it's true.. had to return it
other Purchased this tee online and could not be happier with what arrived in my mailbox. this tee is perfect to throw on to run errands or out to lunch. the fabric is so soft, fit is true to size, i don't like tight fitting shirts, if you do i suggest ordering down a size. overall great detail, fit and just as pictured!
other I love these tanks. the straps are wide enough to hide my bra straps. they're soft. and long enough to give me added length to shirts that run short. because this tank runs small and i had to size up to get the fit that i like, the straps are a little long, but after i alter them with a little sewing, they're perfect. i've had to do this with retailer tanks in the past, and it's worth it to me for the quality that i'm getting. the regular price is too high, so i only buy them on sale. i try
other I have this in the beautiful spring green/pink combo and i this gorgeous blue/maroon tapestry combo, which is prefect for fall. unfortunately, i bought the green in s and it's still pretty big in the bust area, but they sold out of xs. i was able to get the blue in xs and it fits perfectly. i usually order m
other This sweater is like a giant hug. i wore it today and received so many compliments.
other I love the idea of this top, but there is just way too much fabric involved in person! i'm 5'other and usually wear a small or medium to accommodate a fuller chest. i ordered a small and it fit fine around the chest but the huge swing hem combined with the slightly stiff fabric is just enormously unflattering. i feel like they could have made about 3 shirts out of it. i think the picture must have it pinned a ton in the back, the silhouette is nothing like shown. if there were just less fabric, i wo
other I got this in an xs as the s sold out before i could purchase. i can still zip it at 27.5/28" but would be more comfortable at say 26". i'm almost 5'5" and with 3" heels it skims the floor perfectly. i'm so obsessed with the weight and texture! it is full and fabulous! i'll just need to slim down a tad so i can be comfortable at my sister-in-laws wedding next month. i wore a very fitted tank and it works perfectly! photographs well and feels very red carpet worthy.
other Love everything about this. i bought this after reading other reviews. beautiful fabric, i'm 5'10", 13other and bought the small and fits perfect. it's great with heels or flats... seriously just makes you want to twirl, dance, skip, you name it.
other I love this top so much i tried it on twice. because i forgot why it didn't work the first time: i have a chest. i'm just a c cup, but i looked lumpy and matronly in this top. if that's not an issue for you, i think you'll love it.
3 I think these are amazing for anyone over, say, 5'5". the way these hung on me (at 5'2") were very unflattering in the front. they had an unfortunate masculine effect to them. that's all i can say without being crass.
other I ordered both the petite and regular in the olive green motif. the regular fit more as i was hoping so i returned the petite.i am only 5' 4" but my legs are long for my height. i wasn't ready to have the side slits "up to here" and whereas they are not they are still quite high it is modest enough to be worn any place i might wear the dress. i think i will likely wear a belt with it as shown at least part of the time. i just bought some print fabric sling back shoes which go beautifully with
other Nice quality, details, and i like the looser cut (works well on this blouse).
other This cardigan caught my eye and i had no idea how soft and wonderful it would feel so it's a win-win! it hangs a little boxy so i'll need to figure out how to style it so it's more flattering. the pockets are a pretty gold color (you can see it from the inside) and adds a nice touch of color. it's a keeper!
other I loved this top so much i bought both colors! soft and warm without being too thick or bulky.
other I absolutely love this suit and was very disappointed to have to return it! it is really well made and the fabric colors/design is beautiful in person. unfortunately it just did not fit my body type. i am athletic build with a smaller chest and thicker behind, 120lbs, 5'4. the small was definitely the right size for me, but the back of the suit cut way high up on the butt so that a lot of the rear is exposed, which just did not work well for me. this will work great for someone with a smaller bu
other I am a huge fan of absolutely everything tanvi kedia designs. her clothing is intricate, boho, colorful and fits like a dream. when i saw this online i had to have it. it just arrived today and its everything i imagined it to be! the fit is more like the studio pics and less like the first catalog pic. the dress definitely has some room, but it isn't quite as swingy as the catalog photo. i have a lot of curves, so it may be swingy on a more slender figure. i ordered an xl mostly because of the s
other I typically wear a 26 or 27 in jeans, had to size up to a 28 in these. the legs felt fine in the size 27, but the waistband was a bit tight, so i went with the 28s. i am 5'2" 115lbs. i'll also be hemming or possibly just cutting these off, they are about other inches longer on me compared to the model pictured.
other Heavier fabric than it looks but cute and versatile. flattering as well!
other I completely agree with the other reviewer. this sweater is so much prettier in person. i've been looking for years for a tasteful fur sweater and i think i finally found it. the size large was true to size for me aside from the very long sleeves, but i also have short arms. the fur isn't overwhelming and i love the pockets. i usually find sweaters with wool itchy but this one is not (it's 26% wool). i do plan to wear a cami or tank underneath.
other Great tank to wear to work or a night out. fits true to size.
other I love the great variety of fabrics and textures used in these joggers - you will also!
other I got this dress in navy for my engagement photos and i got so many compliments on the design and fit of the dress. it's very comfortable and stretchy so i got a 6 petite and it fit perfectly, where normally i need an 8 or a 10 because clothes are made so tight now. it was light weight and fit great in the bust and fell nicely over the hips. and for the bottom of the dress being white, it surprisingly wasn't see through. i wouldn't go wearing bright red under the dress but there is definitely no
other This is a beautiful lightweight sheer blouse. the front has a liner and the arms and back are sheer. i usually wear a s or xs - the xs was plenty roomy. i'll wear a cami due to the sheerness of the back .the cutouts in the long sleeves are quite pretty. overall this is a classy blouse that can be worn with any number of jeans, slacks or skirts. thanks retailer!
3 I loved this dress and was hoping to keep it. but, for an a-lign dress it was not roomy enough in the hips and the waist was baggy. i think this dress would look great on a very very slim build with straight hips.
3 This was just not flattering for me--looked too much like a maternity dress. i can't really do a belted waist so perhaps that would make this dress more versatile for someone else. i was sorry to have to return because it goes well with sandals and boots!
other Colors are very vibrant! lays very nicely on the body.
3 I ordered this top because i liked the look in the back, however, the top i received looks nothing like the back. online it shows that the back has elastic & is gathered. also online it shows thin straps (that look like a bra strap) but my top has no thin straps & no elastic~ extremely odd!! i called customer service but the lady i spoke to didn't have any information or complaints about the top. i'm holding on to the top because it is cute from the front, but i was really wanting the back to lo
other Very pretty blouse with nice detail. needs to be worn with a camisole however.
other A lovely sweatshirt with mesh front and back cover with soucotache (sp?) handwork, with a touch of sequins for some pop! the knit sleeves are thin, but the top has some weight due to the detailing on the front and back.the fit is tts and as shown on the model. it lays comfortable but it's not really baggy.really lovely. glad i bought one before it was sold out.
other Love the swing-style boxy fit. versatile - works well over jeans or any pants and top. like the coated linen (or cotton?) look. serves much the same purpose as any light weight or denim jacket - good to wear over a top to complete an outfit or as an extra thin layer but not a substantial outdoor jacket. really quite cute. fairly tts but if between sizes, size down.
other I bought this dress in red for a wedding. i love the laser-cut design and the fit overall is good except, as another reviewer wrote, the psuedo-empire waste is likely not awesome for anyone with an average to longer torso. i have a super long torso and the dress still works, but a lower waist would have taken it from good to "wow". love the innovative take on a classic silhouette/design, though (and the red is gorgeous).
other Feels great, flows nicely, and love the pockets that hide pretty much everything from a lipstick container to a phone.
other I have been thinking about getting this dress for a while, but was holding out because i was concerned it would look like a sack! but i am so glad i got it, and so glad my usual size was not available! typically i'm a m or a m petite but i ordered this in a s petite. while still flowy, i think it would have been overwhelming in my usual size. i think it will be great for many occasions as the solid black can be dressed up or down. i can't wait to wear it! definitely consider sizing down.
3 I ordered other dressed in other different sizes. neither fit... both were very tight... runs very small.
other This is a great, effortless top. you can dress it up or down and fits true to size. it's forgiving and the straps draw your eye to the most flattering part of the body. the fabric is stretchy and and comfortable.
other This dress is extremely comfortable and flattering. it has a forgiving a line shape to it for women like me who are pear shaped. the top of the dress is made of a heavy type of cotton material and the bottom tiers are made of a silky material that hangs beautifully! even the tie closure in the back of the dress adds a lovely touch to the dress. i would recommend wearing it with leggings ( as shown with the model) or black tights. the fit is true to size. i am 5'6" and the length is a liittle low
other Strapless dresses can be so flattering so when i saw this on retailer i had to order it! this dress did not disappoint. for reference i ordered a size other and i am 5'5", 13other lbs, 34b chest. in the chest area it fits perfectly, while the ribcage area is a little snug, but not uncomfortably so. the pockets are great. the denim quality is great. and i like the frayed bottom of dress. i got compliments straight away on the beauty of the dress from two men. which i thought was quite interesting because i
other So glad i gave these a try last summer in the peachy pink color. this year, i got the darker grey. color is great- goes with so much-and they are so soft and comfortable. also love that these can work rolled up or down at the bottom
other These jeans fit great, but i think getting the right size is key. i bought my usual denim size 26 and at first i thought they were too tight. but as the day wore on, they softened and conformed to my body and fit like a glove. if i bought them in a larger size, i'm afraid they'd bag out like jeans tend to do. i think it's the "legging" style that makes them so form fitting. i wish they were ankle length like on the model, but i'm 5'5" and they are quite a bit longer on me than the model.
other Just got this in the mail today. very pretty, soft and comfortable. i could probably have sized down, but it fits fine. for reference, i'm 5'4", 138 lbs and i got an xs. grab this while it's on sale!
other I bought this shirt in black and green and now bought the orange. it is casual and stylish at the same time. material is soft. great shirt!
other Cute top. definitely sheer so need an undershirt. really love details on it, especially back and fringe at bottom. 5'4, 13other lbs, ordered s.
other Love these! the raw hem is on-trend! length is great (i'm 5'6"). material is the classic pilcro washed chinos. perfect. as with all pilcro pants, they stretch a bit. :)
other I bought this lovely silk/velvet shirt in the &quot;sky&quot; color but it is more on the teal blue side than sky blue, which disappointed me. it is definitely darker than appears in photo. still a luxurious well-made beauty with sassy appeal. it drapes like a snake slithering down your body. it comes with attitude.
other I love this incredibly soft fabric , it's well designed and very flattering . i am 6' tall with a large bustline , dresses can be difficult as the waistline usually hits in the wrong spot . but not this dress ! it's hits the spot and the high-lo hemline flatters my legs ! bought this to wear to hawaii ,paired with a panama hat and a pair of flatform sandels .
other This dress is timeless. so cute on and fits easily. i like that it has long sleeves yet it is a light fabric. comfortable and stylish. that is for me! i am taking it this weekend to nyc for a trip. i think i will fit right in!
other This dress immediately caught my eye in the store. the colors are vibrant and the cut is flattering. i wear a smaill and it fit perfectly, the sweater material is not thick so it can be worn all year. it is very versatile.
other This shirt runs big, it's very long. material is very pretty and it is lined. i am keeping it for that spontaneous need to wear something sparkly...dinner party maybe?
other I am so happy i took a chance on this jumpsuit! i am post-baby (six weeks) and although i intend on slimming down more i would say that it is flattering even at my current size. and it will only get better! the quality and color are great!
other The material that was used to make this top is very thin and poor quality. it feels like the type of material that will disintegrate after one wash. i normally wear an xl and this top is huge and not flattering. returning asap.
other This is a great top going into the fall season. it runs a little large. i went down one size and it fits perfect!
other This is my first demin jacket ever as all the ones i ever tried were too stiff, and far too boxy and long on me. i need to thank all the reviewers who helped me take the plunge..got the size xs regular which is only slightly snug at bust when buttoned and a tiny bit long in the arm for me (5'2", currently 33-25-37 with narrow shoulders and torso). very flattering look. if this jacket comes out in a new darker wash version i will definitely also try a petite size s..the one i got in the mail
3 I love this dress, but it is too short to keep. i am 5'8" and weigh 124lbs. most of my cloths from retailer are either a size other or a small, but this dress is substantially shorter than other dresses purchased from retailer. it looks adorable on, but it is just too short (about 3 inches above my knees) to be considered professional enough to wear to work.
other This is a very nice dress. the jersey is soft and high quality. the construction appears solid. the color is very pretty, and looks in real life just like it does on my computer. the cut and draping just don't work for me. there's just too much draping, too much fabric. it overwhelmed me and made me look bigger than i am. i have a feeling this would be much more flattering on a curvier figure than my own. this dress seemed to be trying to accentuate curves i don't really have (especially in the
other Very soft color and soft to touch. the material is light and airy and it feels great on. i wear a medium and bought the small. i would definitely buy this in another pattern if they made it as cute as the flamingos.
other I could not resist this top. it is super cute, the material is nice and thick (you can get away with wearing no bra). shows off your bronzed or creamy skin to perfection. i can't wait to wear this :). i think the cut is very flattering for all figures. top might be a bit tight for very big busted ladies though.
other Yay hei hei! love these pants. thanks to the roll-up, they show a nice bit of ankle. lightweight but sturdy?i've been reaching for them when it just seems too hot for jeans. they're a little poufy toward the top (below the waist), but the tie waist makes them sufficiently cinchable. i expect to get a lot of wear out of these this summer. i did experience some stretching/sagging after a full day of walking, moving, and sitting, so i bought my second pair in m instead of l. (got navy and went back
other I am very pleased with this skirt! you can tell it is very well made and is just beautiful! very true to size!
other I was hoping that this would be a nice neutral layering staple but it simply leaves a lot to be desired. it fits tts, length is fine...the inside is some, but the outside darker material is stiff and cheap (kinda canvas feeling?). the material is super stiff which makes it flare out like like a tent in a super unflattering way. it also is on the thinnish side - it looks in the model shot like it would be a little thicker and warm. this is definitely going back.
3 I adore this blouse, but the cut is a bit weird. the shoulders fit snugly and the body is blousy/boxy. the colors are super cute and the cutouts are unique but i don't think this top is for everyone.
3 I thought this was so cute online, sweet and feminine, but when it arrived and i tried it on in my usual 12p i felt like i had just stepped back into freshman year of highschool - it is very early 90s - not the bohemian i was going for. it is also very high waisted, even for my little 5'other frame. i truly felt like they pulled this out of someone's closet, dusted it off and said, ta da! as much as i love rachel and monica i have moved on from their clothing :)
other This worked for me, very elegant, cozy and comfortable.
other The images definitely do not do the jacket justice. the detail is beautiful, and the fabric is unexpected and quite luxurious.
other On sale this is a great deal. the structure and fit of it are perfect- maybe runs a tad big, but i liked that- it's supposed to be a snug fit, and is, without being too clingy. i chose the berry color and love it- the ribbed style of fabric wasn't as visible in the pic online but i don't mind it in the darker color. can be worn with a bit of flair by unbuttoning the turtleneck or kept classic by not-
other We were at dinner in provence at sunset... and in walked a young lady wearing this lavender? dusty blue? lilac? creation- just swingy enough to be perfectly comfortable, yet lacy enough to be elegant. the color struck me as "south-of-france". they were american by accent. i was too shy to ask the brand of her dress, but knew by the powers of the internet that this dress would one day be mine. magnolia lace dress- i found you!!!
other Love love love! i'm 5'8", 12other lbs, 34b, and have an athletic frame (fairly narrow hips) and i bought an xs (in red.) usually i am a s with retailer for dresses (although occasionally a m for slimmer dresses), but i found that the top part of this dress required me to size down to an xs as the low back-design of the dress fit too loosely with the size s--it hung so that it showed my bra straps and the sleeves were a tad baggy under the arms, showing about 2" of bra underneath. my guess is that if y
other The pictures don't do this dress justice. it is fantastic! the fit is perfect and it is super comfortable while still looking polished. a must have dress!
other This sweater is really pretty. it is a little itchy, but seems really well made. i also like that you have the option of wearing it open with the tie tied in the back for some shape. a nice alternative to the basic cardigan.
other The stitching is why i like this dress. even though the arms and waist were a little large on me, i decided to keep it because of the beautiful pattern. (i think going a size down from what i normally wear would be too tight across my back or too short.) i will wear it with a cardigan, tights, and boots as the weather gets cooler.
other While i wouldn't normally look at this piece, the price was unbeatable. i was even more impressed when it arrived and i tried it on! the design is reminiscent of an old time patchwork quilt fairy tale- more beautiful in person than in the pic. the covered buttons at the neck and wrists are just lovely and feminine, and the dress falls and flows around me in a fun and flirty way. i paired it with charcoal heather tights and dark gray booties- super cute! you won't regret it.
other First, let me say i really like these pants before i get into what's wrong with them. the fabric is a nice weight and drapes really pretty. they are very long for you leggy girls out there or ladies who like to wear platform shoes and that's a plus for me.now for the issues: the waist runs small, but not so much that i can't wear them. they are roomy and comfy otherwise, just snug there. the hem came out of mine, so that's the big bummer here. i have to hem them, which is a chore and i wish th
other This is a soft, light sweater that will take you through fall. i got the raspberry, which seems more like a cinnamon color to me. the design is really cute with the fabric inset in the back. i got three of these in different colors so obviously i really like them for layering and can recommend them! it seems tts. i am 5'5" and 140 lbs. medium is perfect.
other This dress is fabulous with attention to most details. 5'4" 103 lbs the 00 fits perfectly. overall fit is excellent, sleek, but not form fitting so very appropriate for work. length is also great, another plus.for work, many times the dresses are just a tad short, but this is great. arm holes are also great, not overly long as they often are. very nicely lined, substantial fabric. the only lack of attention to detail is they did not include the bra strap holders. why can't more dresses be made t
other I ordered the white solid & the white w/blue stripes versions in size xl. both fit me true to size. the fit matches the model's photos. i got these on sale and they're worth that price. they're great basics to have. the white/blue striped one is my favorite. it such a pretty combo. i love the unique neckline too. fun details for a basic tee.
other I ordered this dress in a xs petite. i am 5'0" 10other lbs. the plaid looks more drab in person and the fit was very frumpy. the wrap style is typically flattering but on this dress, the dress tied above my natural waist and the fit made my hips appear larger. i was pretty disappointed in this little number and will be sending it back. it might work on taller people, like the model, but i would steer clear if you are a petite.
other This top is just amazing. it does run large so size down but fit and feel is wonderful especially if you would like to hide some lumps and bumps this is the perfect top.
other This is a beautifully designed jacket that everyone will love and won't want to take off! i went with the gray wool. i always worry about jackets that are too snug, as i am busty, but this fit is superb. the arms are unusually long (though maybe this is good for you). i had a dressmaker shorten my sleeves by one inch, so now it's perfect for me. i bought the regular medium, my usual size (size 8 or medium top, 34f). i tend to wear my blazers and jackets open, but it's nice to know that i can but
other The first reviewer was right about this dress--checked her review before buying it. it's a beautiful creation and perfectly designed, and it's also slimming. i was worried that the fit might be too tight in the skirt, but it is fine. highly recommended.
other Tts - bought my usual pilcro size. enjoy the fit of these better than the serif style.
other I tried on the skirt today in the store and immediately fell in love with how fluid the fabric is and how it looks and feels on, but i had something really awful happen, the zipper was hard to zip up so i just left it partially zipped but close to the top but then when i try to take it off the zipper broke and split down the middle but it was stuck on me! it was the strangest thing that i've ever had happened, and really embarrassing because i had to come out of the fitting room like that to get
other The quality of this top is quite high. it feels like silk. the print is lovely, showy without being too over the top. i love it and would highly recommend it.
other I now have this tee in 3 colors - partly because my daughter loves and shares them with me. i typically get a size medium because i like things to fit a little loose, but needed a small in this shirt. goes great with all styles of jeans/knakis.
other I love this dress! good for work or social occasions. flowy fabric, and not boxy. the length is perfect, not too short.  i can't wait to wear it. picture is accurate as to color.
other After reading the other reviews, i took a chance and ordered the peach one and the blue (red?) one in large. i am usually at the top end of xl's, but i've noticed that holding horses items tend to run a bit bigger. i hit the jackpot with this one. yes, it's a little "boxy". all the better to hide what i want to hide. the length is perfect for me and the gathers at the shoulders give enough room across the chest so that it doesn't pull at the buttons. the peach one came today, and i was a bit sur
other This is a great top and got compliments already...it does have a longer sleeve like the picture, butreally not bad. it's so comfortable and color is fabulous. great with any scarf too.
other I ordered this style in the blue, red, yellow and white for the sale price. they all fit true to size, matching the model's photos. but, the quality is poor. the hems are frayed, they wrinkle easily, they're just a mess. the model's photos show a messy look so you know what you're getting. the positives are the colors. the blue is especially gorgeous. the yellow is like a spicy mustard shade. they are all comfortable. just sloppy looking. the sale price matches the quality. they do stretch out t
other I love how elevenses fit and the length is awesome when i wear flats. this is one of the few brands that sometimes carries a longer 33-34" inseam. this style is a bit shorter- however, with the lighter fabric, i wouldn't want it touching the ground. pants are breezy and i love that they are lined to the calf. call me old fashioned, but all pants should be lined! the elastic waist is nice and flat in the front and works wonderfully since my butt is larger than my waist.
other Great skirt, fits as expected. very cute, can be dressed up or down. i love the pockets!!
other Love love this skirt! quality is great and so comfortable. you can even do this skirt with boots and sweater in colder months! so glad i got it!!
other I saw this peasant blouse online and thought it looked cute, but not really enough to spend the money on. i purchased a few other things instead. i happened to go into the store to see a different top in person and spotted this one. it is definitely cuter in person. as with most tops like this, it is baggy and loose. however, probably due to the elastic at the bottom, this one doesn't look overly big and shapeless. just a pretty top that will be perfect for spring. for reference, i am 5'6 115, a

other Beautiful dress; i ended up getting it in both the red and the green. the fit is absolutely perfect and it flatters pretty much any figure. one thing i would say is that you should get your exact size if possible; i ordered it online because it was so pretty in the 4p. i happened to be in the store the next week and i ttried on the 4r in the store just to see how it looked and it was awful! i was so disappointed but then my dress arrived in the mail and the 4p fit me perfectly. i'm so glad retailer
3 Slouchy relaxed fit. well sewn together and hangs well on the body. bottom hem hits upper thigh. good length and soft, easy fabric. light layering option as well. good spring jacket, can be kept on indoors without getting too hot.
other This top is gorgeous.  i normally wear s to m depending on brand and style.  ordered a s and it was so small i returned and have l on order.  it is cropped.  i am 5'3" and it hit me as pictured on model.  if you are tall or like longer tops this may not be for you
other These socks were so narrow, especially on top, that they pinched my thighs and we're almost painful to wear all day. my thighs are pretty narrow, i'm only five feet tall and my legs and hips are the thinnest part of my body. i understand that they need to be reinforced on top so that they don't slip down but these are definitely made for a person who is unhealthily skinny. "one size" is definitely not true. they also snag easily.
other Love this versatile cardigan, have both blue & orange colors & they're beautiful. it's light weight yet cozy. true to size but the sleeves are a little snug so if you like roomier sleeves size up.
other I bought this top in the store and love it. i was surprised to see negative reviews online. i am small chested, curvier on the bottom. this top does have a wide and short fit but the cut is flattering. all three colors are beautiful. i wear it with high waist short jean shorts and it looks very fresh.
other I ordered this to go over a dress. i wanted the jacket short, to not cover the waist of the dress. on sale, i think it is a great bargain. the sleeves are long on me, but i rolled them, which i thought was intended since they are lined. the medium fit me. i am usually an 8 in tops. the ivory color is almost a pure white.
other This was so unflattering. the bust was too high so it hit me weird on the boobs. the green was a beautiful, vibrant color but the fabric is so delicate that one wrong move would cause a snag.
other This dress is very small in the bust and maxi length on short people (5'3" 36dd). i can't wear a normal bra, i have to use adhesive pasties. the fabric is very smooth, thick and satin like, but fuzzes easily. mine came with minor thread pulls and one strap was sewn on twisted. the pattern in real life is very pink as opposed to the model sample which has more blue landscape. i'd like to hem the dress but i would sacrifice pattern. still very pretty dress. be sure to size up one or two depending
other I had my eye on this dress for months. i came into some extra cash and bought it at full price online and picked it up in the store. the purple pattern is nowhere near as soft as pictures. it was very bright which disappointed me. it's also made for more busty women. at a 34d i could in no way fill this dress out. the result made it look so frumpy and unflattering. i felt like an old lady in a bag.
other Great design & execution - this is essentially a striped jersey sleeveless turtleneck, made of a nice, high-quality jersey. with a delicate lightweight soft sweater attached over it. so you get this really pretty look where the jersey underlay means the sweater hangs beautifully, no clinging at all. and the sleeves are just the sheer sweater - so pretty.i got the lavender - looks exactly like the pic. and it is true to size.
other I bought this tee in most of the colors available. that's how much i liked it. it's not tissue thin; it's a good medium weight. it does't hug the body too closely. i am 5'other and 140 lbs with a little post partum belly and this is a really flattering tee in m.
other Ugh, i hate that this didn't work! the top shoulder/sleeve portion is so pretty and unique, but the fabric is overall this and cheap feeling, the length is too short for how flowy the shirt is (the sides go way up on me). the fabric feels like something that would fall apart after one wash. back it goes!
other This dress is gorgeous! i absolutely love the embroidery. a note about the sizing- while the top portion fits snugly, the hip section runs slightly big. i was surprised to find that the other i ordered looked baggy, so i went into the store to try a 2, but the 0 was the best fit! however i'm small-chested (and 5'6" 113lbs), so i was able to go with the 0 as it fit the hips much better. if you're a bustier type though, the top may be tight. other than the tricky sizing, it's perfect.
other Definitely cute and good fit but the distressing at knee is open and will probably get worse, worth it if price lower... maybe
other I read the other reviews before i ordered this top and was a little concerned about the fabric, but it's fine. the neutral color is a little bland, but i can wear it with bright pants. since i expected it to run large i ordered a small. the tie in the front makes it fit like a dream, plus it looks amazing from the back.
other I bought this dress in blue. it's a light jersey material, but it is lined. i find it very flattering. i have found more occasions to wear it than i expected.
other This is a great fitting jacket. the style, etc.i got this in the grey - i would have exchanged it for the green (but have a similar color that i bought last year from retailer.so i ended up returning it - only because i didn't like the color on me.
other I tried on a small, but usually am xs:this shirt dind't seem like it had too much fabric or too bulky to me as it did to others adn i tried on a larger size. teh material is soft and feminine, and love the embroidered detail. one thing to note is i found that even with the layer of fabric, it was still a bit sheer and i could see through in some of the dressing room lighting. didn't purchase only based on the skin tone v's shirt color. color of shirt is gorgeous, but i am pale and it wasn't
3 First of all, the colors are really pretty, fabrics feel really nice. but.... the fit was no bueno. i think if you are tall and small chested, this dress would look great. but i'm short and large chested and it was very unflattering. when the fabric transitions from the stripes to solid, it doesn't hang nicely due to my chest. sadly this is a return for me.
other I ordered this top in a xs which is what i usually wear in most tops. a little big but just shrunk it. very comfy and love the color.
other This dress is beautiful! i normally do not order online because i am so picky with how clothes fit. i am 5'other and 138 lbs. i recently had a baby, so i am self conscious about my tummy area still. this dress fits great and looks great on! it's sort of "a" shaped, but very flattering and still gives you a good overall shape. the colors are a redish orange, navy and creamish white. i'm having to exchange it at the moment because it came in missing both buttons on each sleeve. the buttons are necessa
other This sweater is great for cold weather. it is very comfortable and soft. only down side is it is a little boxy.
other I did size up on this one. it came in and it was too snug for a loose shirt. i sized up and i love it now. i went to the store and bought it in white and black. i sized up in the white but not the black. you may want to try them on before purchasing them. i want more.
other I love anna sui's lines makeup to everything. this dress is beautiful in a very usual sort of way and after trying it on, i couldn't see anything spectacular that made it unique or special somehow. the elastic waist does make this dress forgiving and it runs big. the hem is lovely scalloped. each detail is very nice in and of itself but when put together in this dress, there is no wow that justifies the full price tag. now that it's on sale i'll keep it probably for summer.
other I bought this shirt at the store and after going home and trying it on, i promptly went online and ordered two more! i've gotten multiple compliments anytime i wear any of them. great for looking put together with no fuss. people that have commented there's were destroyed in the wash didn't read the care label which says dry clean.
other This is such a flattering top. i bought it in green. the green is a cooler version of kelly green, not the muted green i see on my computer screen. i'm fair complected and that color looks great on me. i love the elastic at the waistband, which helps camouflage my mom belly. i wish they made more tops with blousy, elastic waists! i bought several new tops this summer and this is probably my favorite. after wearing it for a couple of weeks, i decided to remove the tie string, which hangs low; it
other I stumbled upon this dress yesterday at the store and fell in love with it! i wore it today with boots and received tons of compliments. it is light, comfortable and flattering. i love that it is machine washable, too!
other I have to disagree with earlier reviewers who suggested this top isn't flattering for larger-breasted women. i'm breastfeeding, so i currently have dds that are the bane of my existence, and i was very happy with the way this top fit across my chest. i didn't give it a full other stars for aesthetic/design only because i wish it were a bit longer. it hit me below my waist, but not below the crotch of my jeans where it hits the model (possibly because she is not burdened by swollen breasts). the shir
other As much as i buy from retailer, this is my first review. the pictures do not accurately show how large this dress is in person. i wanted something that was a bit flowy, but this was a reminder of little house on the prairie. the most unflattering dress ever and since it's only available online, i'm not interested enough to try a smaller size.
other I ordered the navy, which is really stunning, by the way-and the cream. i asked my husband to choose the color for me and he asked me to keep both of them! there you have it. that should say it all! it is a beautifully done lace with an attached camisol liner which, if i'm not mistaken is on snaps so that you can remove it and wear your own cami if this one has a weird fit for you. the navy is really pretty due to the stark contrast of two shades of blue. as i said, my husband saw the cream colo
other This is a beautiful dress! i bought the red color in petite and love it. i know i will wear it a lot and the style is really easy to wear. i feel amazing in it even tho my post baby body isn't what it was.
3 I was very disappointed to receive this and to note that the blouse has no ruffle down the front as pictured. there is no ruffle anywhere on the blouse. i am likely still going to keep it because i like the pattern, but the ruffle was what interested me for a cute work blouse and i want other shoppers to know that the blouse actually includes no ruffle when you order it.
other I was pleasantly surprised when i tried this on. i tried it because of the detail but didn't hold out much hope because it looked frumpy on the hanger. i was very wrong. it fits beautifully. it drapes nicely, hugs the shoulders perfectly and doesn't droop open due to the embellishments. there is a tiny closure where the fabric crosses in the front so you are not exposed. i liked that feature very much. the sleeves are 3/other on me, but i like it - nice change of pace. this is a very different style
other I love this top, it's long enough to to wear with leggings and the ribbon in the back really dresses it up. the only negative is that the material pulls easy and only on the space dye color, not the solids but i still love it! for reference i ordered xs and it fits perfectly i am 5'other 125lbs
other I live in blue jeans - and i'm extremely particular about style, fit, and fabric. an eternal fan of ag, i tried these on the recommendation of a sales association. in the past week - i've dressed them up, dressed them down, and wished i could wear them to work! the wash is an especially versatile shade of indigo. incredibly flattering fit. if you're going to splurge on one essential this season...these paige jeans are definitely a candidate.
other I love this designer so i grabbed at this shirt immediately. unlike their other items, this shirt is linen. it's a great cut and very flattering once you iron it. the only problem i found was that as i wore it throughout the day, she shirt became wrinkled and misshapen to the point where it ballooned out around my stomach.
3 The fabric felt beautiful, and it felt great on, but once i looked in the mirror it just looked too housedress like. maybe because it runs large. the price seemed high as well. i wanted to love it but i had to return.
other Beautiful, timeless dress. runs small, straight fit. can't wait to wear it to work or a function,
other I love the way this dress looks on me. it skims my figure to hide my flaws, the bright embroidery is eye catching, the layers flow when i walk, it's a great midi length and it doesn't make me look wider in profile.  i'm not having the see-through issue since the patterns are busy and my lingerie matches.  i purchased 10 petite and my measurements are 39-28-35. my dilemma is three fold: the material is polyester & rayon, causing some uncomfortable heat to generate when sitting. then there's
other I ordered this shirt online in green, size small. i am 5'4" and 120 lbs.i was a little worried the small might be too long &/or tentlike (i probably would have ordered a petite small had it been available), but it fits great!!!i love the earthy color combined with feminine lace... unique, comfy, gorgeous!
other This is adorable! the sweater is light-weight and soft. please know that the sweater line falls right at my mid-riff, followed by the fringe, so for me, it's almost cropped. the fringe covers my mid-riff. the back is open and so this sweater will not be super warm in the winter, but it is stylish and cute. i love it! it's different and unique. i purchased xxs in petite. fits a little more cropped than the photo shows.
other I love this top. i got the blue, the colors are deep and just beautifuli'm normally a large, so i feel this top runs large. i got the medium and it fits perfect it is long, i'm 5'6" and it hits the bottom of my butt. you won't be disappointed, try this top
other I saw this dress online and loved the colors and whimsical embroidery . i thought it would be the perfect dress to wear on the weekend with cute sandals. i was excited when the dress arrived in the mail as the colors were vibrant and the material was soft and cozy. unfortunately this dress is huge. it is a rectangle with pockets. i bought the xxsp, my usual size and this dress was so big my sister was able to fit in it with me.this dress was beyond alterations. too bad it was a great idea but no
other Ok, so the shirt is "dry clean only", however, i like it so much that i'm not going to knock out a star in the rating. the quality is really nice and it was not too short for me ------ i could reach up without worrying my stomach would be exposed. i'm 5'6", 36c and 12other lbs, and the size 6 was perfect. wonderful for work and also great with jeans. i know it's a little pricy, but it's cute and unique --- plus right now it's 25% cheaper.
other I am not really a "print person" but cartonnier gets it right every time - modern prints that lend themselves to many styling and paring options. the charlie trouser, which they do every season, is a great fitting pant (going up a size is a must as they do run small) with details (stitching, buttons, pockets) that make their pants look more expensive than they actually are.i bought these in the blue combo when i saw them at my local retailer store. the blue combo has both blue and black (as well
3 This dress is a bit scratchy, but overall i liked the fabric well enough. on someone blond and fair, the peach color washes out a bit. the issue for me with the dress is that front is just too short for my height (i'm other 9 1/2). it looked a bit obscene. the small otherwise fit me great. i have broad shoulders, small chest and and slim.
other I love this dress. it's an unusual material and really adorable in person. the problem was that it runs so large that i couldn't make it work. i'm usually an xs regular. the xs swallowed me. so then i ordered it in a pxs and pxxs because i really wanted it to work. only the pxxs fit, but it was so short that there was no way i could make it work. and i'm only 5'1". i am 5other years old so i am not comfortable wearing ultra short dresses. maybe a person who doesn't mind really short would be able to
other I wore it for the first time this week and received so many compliments. i bought the white one and it's a tiny bit see through, but still love it.
3 It gets a little old to receive products over and over that do not match the photo or description of the product, retailer! the photo shows a black pant with blue colored striping. the pants that i got are black with green and brown striping. i find the color combination in the photo to be what i wanted and since the fit was nice (albeit short and i'm only 5'5" tall) i would have kept these. unfortunately, the pants that i got are nowhere close to the description so i will be returning them. the f
other I'm 5'3, i ordered the petite (nice to have this option), the length/volume doesn't overwhelm me as some kimonos do. this feels more like a fall-season kimono due to the fabric content. it is not a wispy fabric, there's weight and some stiffness to the drape, you can see on the model how the fabric stands away from her body. it's a different look from silky feeling kimonos that hug the body. a rich blend of blue, black, white, subtle tan, maybe some silver grey - hard to tell, the colors look li
3 Runs very big.  i ordered a l and need a m.  unfortunately no medium left!  great top with lots of character. hate i missed this cute top
other This was my first time to purchase and wear a tunic and i was very hesitant about the look, but i love this design! it is beautiful and seems to be very well made. i agree with a previous reviewer that the slit is high (it comes to my waist, but i don't think it is a problem. i always appreciate this in other reviews, so hopefully it helps: i'm 5'2", 117 lbs, and a small 32b. the xs works well for me.
3 I have a love hate relationship with this product. it is comfortable and cozy, yet unshapely. after the initial wear, the product begins to stretch out, and if you sit for a while your knees are demarcated in the fabric once you stand. the sherpa front is soft, but the waffle material in the back is in no way flattering. i purchased for sleeping so it does that job nicely, but i would never leave the house with this on. i am hoping that after the first wash it shrinks a bit too. i am typically a
3 The vest looks  so stylish on. it makes a regular t shirt look edgy with it on. i love the vest but the price is too high
other I just bought these shorts in the gold color. the fit is just right and the material / quality matches up to the price you pay. totally worth every penny.
other This is a perfect dress for work or fun. flattering and flow with lovely little subtle details.
other I bought a pair of these in stone and after the first wash they become all splotchy. i chalked it up to perhaps there was bleach leftover in the my washer. although nothing else in the load was blotchy. i then, because i loved the cut of these pants, bought another pair in the darker blue color. the same thing happened after the first wash. again, nothing else in that wash load was the least bit ruined -- just my new retailer pants! such a bummer-- definitely a dye issue. i called the stores i pur
other 1. i'm 5'5" tall, 14other lbs, and 38-32-40 and the size 30s fit me perfectly.2. the hyphen chino is my favorite pant. just stretchy enough. just casual enough without being sloppy. just nice enough to wear to work.3. i bought both pinks and the moss. the turquoise were too big in the waist for some reason, but the color, while gorgeous, didn't work with the rest of my wardrobe.
other Always looking for sweaters that are wearable in south florida, stumbled upon this gem. from the front gorgeous silvery gray, soft sweater and stunning open back with romantic silky black bow details. bows will hide bra easily underneath. so comfortable, classy and sexy.
other Beautiful stitching on the sweater. very soft and a nice length as well. like the soft brown color - will match many things in my wardrobe.
other If i ever find something i can wear sans bra, i am pretty much going to buy it. just looking at this dress i wouldn't think it possible, but it is! this is a rare occurrence for me! honestly, the dress is a little tight a pulls a little bit across the chest (32d), but being able to go braless trumps that for me. hopefully it isn't too noticeable... i did find the straps to be extremely long, so i had them shortened. this dress is adorable and i've received so many compliments. it's so comfortabl
other I am so glad i did not miss out on these jeans. i am new to pilcro and am finding they fit me so well!
other This top is beautiful. i would say the pink stands out more in the print in person than in the picture, and it's gorgeous. the adjustable strap is nice. there is just enough padding in this swimsuit to feel protected without being bulky or worrying about it moving around in the top. this is seriously my new favorite, could not recommend enough!for reference, i am a 34a, and purchased a small.
other I had the seafolly garden suit last year (same cut) and loved it. i decided the light blue color didn't look great on me so i decided to get this one. i found that the garden suit was cut smaller than this umbrella print one. right now i'm a 10 m and got the 1other in this, just like last time. i probably could've gotten the 10 but i'll keep the 1other for comfort. note: the leg holes are not tight and do not make upper thighs/butt squish out like you might imagine. try this suit!
other I purchased this pretty printed dress as soon as i spotted it on-line and ordered it in my usual size petite 6 (i'm 5'4" 34d-27-35) and found it fit me tts and looks just perfect on. i immediately adored all the different prints on this one, the length, the sweet sleeves and waist band and think this will look so adorable with a jean jacket paired with a cute pair of boots this coming fall amd winter. it's a great transition piece that also looks really cute with sandals or clogs as well. also,
other This is so comfortable, i had to buy another one. looks great under sleeveless sweaters. interesting texture adds interest.
other My daughter tried on this shirt in new york & loved it so i ordered it for her for christmasother i am thrilled, & she will be thrilled! love my purchase!
other This light blouse is beautiful and true to size. i ordered the black one and love it!i would recommend this product
other I'm a size other all day everyday. but, these pants wouldn't even meet around my hips. sadly, i'm returning them tomorrow.
other I really like this dress. it does not bother me that it is not lined. i feel very feminine wearing it. i plan to get a shrug to wear with it.
other I bought this shirt specifically for the extra details on the shoulder. when i received the shirt, it was a little stiffer than i expected but not enough to return it for being too uncomfortable.
other Great purchase. true to size. so flattering. love it simplicity.. buy it if you enjoy compliments!
other This sweater was far better than expected. very soft, and flattering. it's light to wear, but keeps me cozy in my freezing office. looks super cute with jeans and boots.
other I love how comfortable this dress is! i ordered an xs and it fit perfectly (i'm 5' 4" and it falls to just above my knee). it holds its shape and is very flattering. pair it with a cute denim jacket and ankle boots for fall, or a light scarf and ballet flats for spring!
other I'm currently on the prowl for the other colors of this fantastic sweater dress/tunic. i own the lavender in size m and it fits perfectly on me (5'3" 36dd) without enhancing what i want to hide. great for winter
other I was so excited to try this sweater on when it arrived but to my disappointment, it was overly large! i was pratically swimming in it. really love the design and the way it looks on the model. just didn't work out that way on me.
other This dress is indeed so lovely in person. i am so glad i ordered other sizes (0p and 2p) based on the straighter-looking cut. i am 11other lbs, 5'1.5", adn 30dd bra size. verdict, the 2p fit better. why, the cehst area is a little snug and hte buttons kept trying to open (and did# i would have ahd to leave it pen and wear a tank under this dress... not an option with such a unique piece.other things: color: wow, very nice in person, i was afraid that the colr would wash me out, but no, i have very p
other I am a teacher and love finding cute, comfortable clothes. i wore this for the first time today and got compliments all day long! i felt so stylish, and i was still able to do what i needed to do!
other Bought in the store, will look great with black or dark blue jeans and a fun long necklace.  does not fit like it looks on the model, it is more fitted.  i plan on wearing a spaghetti strapped cami underneath because the back has a draping effect and is open.  the front is on the shorter side but the bottom of the shirt (not including tassels) reaches the top of my jeans, and the tassels hang below.  it is a very versatile top, one that can be dressed up or down.  sleeves above wrist.
3 Like the other reviewers, i agree that this sweater is waaaay shorter than it looks on the model. i think she's wearing a large size and it's probably cinched in the back. still cute, though! i'm 5'9" 14other and a medium fits well -- looks cute with high-waisted jeans (which i wear anyway).
other Size down on this top. bought it online and when i took out of the packagei quickly put it back in. you could have put other of me in the xs. i think even an xxs would be huge. extremely boxy!! i recommend it only if you can find the correct size.
other My new favorite! i wouldn't have thought twice about this dress handling on a rack in store, but after seeing so many cute pics of ladies in this dress, i caved. i needed a petite, so ordered a sp and xsp. the length on both is perfect. i'm 5'0" and both hit above my knee in front and hit at in back and on sides. i didn't try on a regular in store, but based on the sp/xsp, i'm pretty sure there'd be too much material for a petite frame. the xsp is cut slimmer and if i had a tiny waist, i'd proba
other Bought two of these because i loved the way they fit off of the rack. washed them according to directions and they were ruined. the material shrank up making the shirt short and boxy and the side panels ended up being rippled. definitely going to try to return these.
other I am so glad i ended up with these pants. wasn't ready to pay full price but ordered them immediately on sale & realized they were definitely worth every penny of full price. they are so soft & have so much detail. these pants are just gorgeous. i'm 3other and can't wait to wear these to cabo!! they may run a little large.
3 I was so disappointed when i received this top. the color is some washed-out faded version of the picture shown and the cut is much fuller than it looks in the picture. the back is cute but not worth the awful, drab actual color.
other This is a pretty, yet comfortable dress. perfect to wear to work or out to brunch with the girls.
other This is absolutely beautiful. the picture online doesn't do it justice. i slipped this on with skinny jeans in the store and was hooked instantly. fit was a little large. i would have tried a petite but this shirt doesn't come in petite sizes. love this!
other Very nice design and color (beige). however, i am 5'1", 118# (athletic# and i thought the petite small was a bit too short #even for this cut) and just a bit too tight in the upper arms when wearing over a light-weight long sleeve dress. may work well over sleeveless. will see if a regular small fits better, but then the sleeves will be too long and not easily hemmed like the petite sleeves can be. the fabric is a bit felty for a boiled wool, but not a deal breaker.
other Usually wear a small, sometimes medium. bought this in medium and am very happy with it. form-fitting but not too tight. would probably fit well in a small, if i was in better shape. it does show any flaws, so the medium is more forgiving. bought the black and am considering the neutral stripe. this is a great, medium weight top for cooler days. the snap collar looks nice open. i plan on washing on delicate and hanging up to dry. i never dry clean anything except wool suits and coats.
other The top is indeed a bit boxier than i was expecting, as the other reviewer found. it still looks good tucked in if you're concerned about it. the fact that it's sustainably produced in ghana was a big part of my desire to keep it too. really great to see designers producing clothing responsibly! i wish that how a garment is manufactured is highlighted more on this site because it definitely contributes to my purchases.
other This dress is so pretty, a true cinderella dress, that's why i can't find a reasonable explanation for such an amazing dress to be made out of plastic. i don't understand much about fabrics, but the dress feels like a waterproof camping tent. i bought a size 14, which is what i wear in moulinette souers (i usually go one size up since i find the rib cage small in this brand), the fit was perfect and the cut was very flattering. i will anxiously hope for a remake of this dress with a better fabri
other I adore this dress! it's so charming. great quality, lovely fabric, beautiful color. the fit is supposed to be boxy and probably won't work on a beautiful curvy body. with a petite athletic body, i feel beautiful in it! i wear a small or xs and i definitely needed an extra small. pair it with black or camel, sandals or boots, it's lovely!
other Love love these jeans. they are just the right rise and the straight leg is perfect. the color of the demin is great to wear to work. the fit is great.
other If you are looking for the perfect t-shirt to add a little flare to your basics this is the one for you. it is so comfy and baggy yet still looking like you pulled yourself together. i am just waiting for more colors to come out. i basically live in the green and white versions of this shirt.
other The second this dress arrived in my store i knew it was a must have. i am all things bohemian and this dress encompasses everything wonderful about a free fitting, feminine bohemian dress! first off the sleeves are not fitted. they have quite a bit of fabric to them (big armed ladies rejoice!), but have an elastic cuff so you can wear them high or low. the only fitted part to this dress is the lace panel (which still fits true to size), and the slip underneath (which appears to have a bit of str
3 I'm a vest lover of all shapes, lengths and styles so i had big plans for this vest.  in the end, the pockets ended up ruining the lay and line of this vest.  they are too bulky and end up pulling at the front of the vest, drawing your eye to the pockets and not the neckline.  i agree with previous reviews that it could be worn into spring- i wouldn't wear it in summer.  the fit is loose, i thought the medium arm holes were large for my frame- 5'8" 140#.  overall i sent it back.
other I purchased this dress on a whim. it is easy to wear and very comfortable.  the empire waist is flattering. however, the dress runs large and the lower half is a-line. the neckline is very flattering and you feel put together when wearing this dress.i am happy to have it in my wardrobe. a go-to piece for years to come.
other I love this sweater. i ordered the xs because i have very narrow hips and i didn't want it to be too baggy. it fits a little like a very short sweater dress on me. what i really love is that the arms are nice and long. one of my pet peeves is sweaters that are compromised in arm length. i bought the pink and plan to get at least one other color too!
other Very disappointed. ordered two sizes, the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i wouldn't have worn it and the zipper was sticking. the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked. some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under $100 but at $228 they are not. returning both sizes.
other This top exceeded my expectations. i got it in the gray striped pattern, size small. it's probably the combination of the pattern and the removable padding that makes it very flattering on my small chested figure (i would imagine big chested gals would not find enough support in this one though). the fabric is very soft and comfortable with just enough stretch. overall, very happy with this top. but does it have to be so expensive, retailer?
other I saw this on a girl at the winery where i work and i thought to myself - i have to have that top! it is perfect for the fall season. the pattern/print is very intricate and lovely. i think it fits true to size - the petite xxs is just right. the sleeves do not come to the wrist, but the photo here depicts that already. the elastic in the arms feel a little tight, but that would be my own negative comment. the fabric is beautiful and flows just right - it does not feel to big to me at all. i'm s
3 This sweater is fine for the casual days. i bought this in cream and i have to say after one wash it looks old. i'm a huge retailer lover and buy a lot of clothes from them. this is just not the best quality and looks tired after a few wears. very soft, but poor material. not my favorite purchase.
other Love this design it puts a twist on a turtle neck sweater. the only problem i had is that the tie kept coming undone but if you do a double knot the problem is solved! wish i would have bought all the other colors.
other I absolutely love this blouse! it's easily one of my favorite retailer finds in several seasons. it is quite roomy, so anyone hoping for a more form fitting cut won't find it here. this is the type of fit i prefer for summer though, as missouri is just disgustingly humid and i can't stand to wear anything clingy once it heats up. it's sheer, so a cami is required. it's also wrinkle prone, but the fabric is almost like a gauze and is not meant to be perfectly pressed and crisp. it's perfect to thro
other I bought this at the store today and it's the perfect summer top! i'm not going to pull it off my shoulders, so it's a little shorter than shown here. but it goes great with capris and skinny jeans and i plan to take it with me to italy. it will go with so many things! very well made, thickish material.
other It must be hard to photograph white clothing. this lovely top is almost invisible in the featured photo, but it is accurately photographed in the extra photo with the model in a jacket. this will feel and look great with cardigans or cropped, stylish jackets. i'm so glad i ordered this lovely, white, lacey top, and i do recommend it to you. i only dinged it one star because it would be even better in cotton and silk, which are frequent tiny brand materials. i went with the size large, as this be
other My new favorite top to throw on
other I thought this dress was beautiful, but i felt it was a little young for me. i am 5other and was looking for something to wear to my niece's wedding. if i had been the mother of the bride, i would have kept it, but....
other I ordered size large in the denim color and tops like this are the reason i shop at retailer. this is such a sweet little floral, vertical, slimming, goes with anything print. the buttons down the front close with loops. it's easy to unbutton a few and pull this over your head. i'm a busty 34g and there's no gapping or pulling. the shirt arrived with the sleeves rolled and i had a heck of a time getting those tiny buttons into the cuff but once in, the cuff is wide enough to just slip your arm thr
3 I had high hopes for these as coh is my favorite brand of denim, and these crops were made specifically for petites. also, i was happy to see they were described as a straight jean, not a skinny. the fit and sizing seems to be a little off. i ordered my regular size in this brand, 27p, but they were too big. sized down to a 26p. they were still too large in the waist (seemed very stretchy) but fit well in the legs. i like the fact that these crops were made for petites so the length was perfect,
other This sweater is really pretty in person, and well-made. every time i wear it someone stops what they are doing to compliment it; one person asked if it was home-made( in a good way) i will admit that i would not have paid full price and did get it on sale, and in that case it's worth it. the sweater does have an unusual cut. the waist is boxy and the back is a bit shorter, but somehow it works. for me i see it as a cool style and not a mistake. it's super warm and i love it.
other I bought these in pink and added taupe to my wardrobe because one pair is not enough. i found a tiny variation in size between my two pairs, but for the most part they are true to size. i love the just below the navel rise. they pair well with strappy or fringe sandals. i haven't worn them with boots yet, however i think they'll be great since they hug in close to the calf and ankle without being tight. buy them in the size you buy jeans or one waist size smaller if you're sometimes this or some
other I consider this to be a flattering dress that is a good wardrobe staple since it can be dressed up or down and worn with a variety items (i.e. cropped denim jacket, oversized knit cardi, leather moto.) the twisty knot in the front is very cute and slimming and doesn't add bulk to my squishy squarish waist. this dress is tts to a bit large. the colors and material make this appropriate for autumn through spring. my only upset with this dress is the raw edges which cheapens the quality and makes m
other I was looking for a velvet dress for the holidays. this one was beutiful in color and teksture.the only problem was that it was snug in the shoulders. going a size up would have made it too roomy elswhere.
other Nice chunky knit cotton tank with cut-out shoulders. sporty looking. armholes are the right size and bra doesn't show. no holes to see through, even in white. tts. i took my usual medium. falls to about hip bone, approx 20" from shoulder. not tight, not baggy, but has a nice comfortable drape. i got in white. best to put it on before applying makeup. this goes great with black and white print pilazzo pants! love this top.
other I went to my local store and they only had the blue dress in stock, i had seen it online and i didn't expect to like the blue one. i tried it on anyway, and it was adorable! i struggled to choose, but i ordered the gray one at the store and they shipped it directly to me. it arrived quickly and i love it!
other Super cute poncho to add to my wardrobe.  love the grey color and the material is super soft.  glad i snagged this up for less than $30!
other I originally purchased this dress in a petite 6. i am 5'3", 125lbs with a 36" bust. the petite 6 was a bit too tight so i returned it and went up to a size 8. so happy i did! this dress drapes and flows beautifully and i find it immensely flattering to my hourglass figure. i also adore the floral print! one reviewer objected to the way the bodice drapes and the very small hook closure which seemed insufficient. i did not object to this characteristic. it fit me beautifully throughout the bodice/
other I'm desperate for cute patterned shells to either layer or wear alone. i wanted this cute print to work - and it can, but it's just not great. the material is almost spandex-y, which is a bit weird. the only place it ran a bit small on me is the length of the straps, making the neck and the arms higher than i like. if i go up a size, it might be too much fabric and pleated swing around the waist. so close!
other These culottes are beautiful! really pretty cerise shade with a nice eyelet pattern. they are only partially lined. the size small, my normal size, was falling off of me so i sized down to extra small which fit perfectly.
other Love love! beautiful, soft, great color! very comfortable!
other I purchased the blue stripes and the black cat prints on sale and i'm very pleased. they each fit me a little differently as the black cats fit tighter through the arms, the stripes remain a bit looser throughout. no complaints here! i like the variation. i ordered a size small as i'm normally a size small (36c, 13other lbs, 5'2").
other Love this top! i bought it in other colors; it's a great twist on a basic tee. love love love!
other I love this shirt so much!!! i ordered the gray a day after i received the sage color. this shirt is soft, true to size, comfortable and extremely flattering. it is one of my new favorite go-to shirts. retailer - great job at finding a stylish, casual top that can take me through all the seasons.
other I read all the reviews before purchasing this and took the advice of others on sizing up. i am 5'4" hourglass shape (32d, 27 inch waist, size 28 pant size) and normally wear a size 4p in retailer dresses. i ordered a 6p and the top was way too big on me. i went straight to an retailer store to try on a other regular and the top half was perfect on me. a little too long for my liking (about an inch below my knee), so i re-ordered it in a 4p. this dress ran true to size for me. i recommend trying it on in
other I love this top! tassels are not too big. material is thick. i wish is was a little longer though.
3 I wanted to love this shirt but it quickly lost shape and a hole was created in the middle of the shirt after just a few washes. not worth the price. poorly made. you need to wear a shirt underneath bc it is so thin. the shirt looks better int he picture. i like it but it wears terribly.
other This dress is absolutely adorable. runs true to size, i am five foot nine and a medium fit perfect. the denim has a lot of stretch. i can't wait to wear it in the winter with tights and boots! don't wait too long before this one sells out.
other This dress did not show well on the hanger but thankfully it intrigued me. i love it, it's very flattering and easily dressed up for work with a heel or dressed down for the weekend. great buy!
3 Love the color and style, but material snags easily
other I love this dress! it flatters so nicely. i'm 5'3 and pretty thin. it hugs all my curves snugly.
other This top is very cute. it looks good with leggings, boyfriend jeans, and flare jeans. be careful, it will shrink. i bought an xs because other reviews said it runs large. it fit great, but i accidentally put it in the dryer and it shrunk. the sleeves that were already were fitted and not loose like the picture shows, shrunk so that they are a little snug on my arms. thankfully, it's still wearable because i do love it and have gotten several compliments on it.
other I just tried these jeans on out of the box and they fit like a dream! i'm 5'0' 100lbs and the 25petite (my usual size) fit me exactly right as full-length skinny jeans. they taper perfectly. no hemming required. they are super comfy and nice and thick. they feel durable and high quality.two suggestions for improvement: 1) i wish is that they were a uniform dark blue wash (but the fadng and whiskering is barely noticeable). 2) i also wish they'd place the butt pockets a little higher, especia
other I know i'm going to get a lot of wear out of this t-shirt this summer. i have it in white, and it's not too see through, which is what i always worry about when i wear white shirts. it's basic but then it has lace on the shoulders that adds something extra. i love its drape--it's not too form fitting. on me (i'm 5'2), it tends to be a bit long, but i like it. the shirt being cotton means that it's super soft. as far as washing goes, best practice is to machine wash and hang to dry--i'm afraid of
other This is a cute t with colors that blend with so many things i already have in my closet.and, i love the western theme which isn't at all girly. usually i purchase v-neck items becausethey suit me best, but i couldn't pass up the idea of cactus and succulents. it will be a funshirt to wear.
other Rarely do i find tops that fit similar to the model in the picture. my body type is no comparison. i am 5'5" and about 170# with 30" waist. this sweater in a large fit perfectly where the back lining and ruffle fell right at the top of my bottom which was very flattering. not to short and not long over bottom. just right. bought in cream and wish i would have bought in both colors...........
other I was monitoring this sweater dress online for quite some time hoping it goes on sale, but as soon as i saw the lighter color sell out i decided to grab the blue version before it runs out as well. it's a simple yet comfortably beautiful dress at the same time. it looks about the same as it does on the model color/fit only in the neck is a little wider with bordered collar, which makes it more interesting. i'm 6ft tall 160lb, ordered a large and i felt the dress was a bit oversized, but with tha
other I was so looking forward to an awesome maxi dress.  this was not it.  completely see through.  i guess you could wear it as a bathing suit cover up.  but be prepared to knot the length or you will trip.  its an odd design. absolutely not worth the price.  i purchased the sm/md and i could have for two of me in the dress. returned this piece without looking back
other This top is drop-dead adorable, very well made, and a flattering fit. i noticed other reviewers saying it is wide and short, but that was not my experience. it's a slight "swing" or "trapeze" shape, but fitted through the shoulders. so, if you are small-shouldered and small in the chest - this is a very, very cute top. for reference, i am 5'4" and a 32c - and i took a size 2. perfect when paired with dark skinnies or capris. it's also delightfully well made with excellent detailing - the cute vi
other I purchased this about a month ago and its a great piece! it goes with just about everything from dresses to jeans and a long sleeve t-shirt. i love how it drapes around the front, and the material is very soft. it's a great piece for fall weather that will be a keeper in my closet!
other This skirt caught my eyes right away in the clearance section. i would have tried size other but it wasn't available. however size other fitted just fine. the print has bright summery feel to it. the lines on skirt are more carrot orange than it is to red. fabric is soft.
other This top has beautiful subtle metallic bits in the pattern. fell in love with the fabric. looks great with high-waist pants.
other I love off the shoulder looks and had high hopes for this top. unfortunately the folded top portion doesn't stay down at all. i found myself pulling at it all day and eventually gave up. the material is also not the best.
other This does run a little large, but it's light and flattering for me. the material is a very light/thin chambray, but it's also lined.
other These are the most comfortable pants i have tried this season without sacrificing the style. they look best rolled up for that casual, chic look and can be dressed up or down. these do run slightly large. i'm 5"other and 102- 10other pounds and took the 2other petite size. i bought the white color and will probably try another color or two before my size sells out. love these and really recommend them!
3 I ordered my normal size 6 in this dress and could barely get it on. it runs very small. i would suggest going up a size or maybe even two sizes up.
other I love the print on this. it's a super cute sweater, but i didn't think it worked so much for a 56 yr. old with a thickish middle. the med. was a bit snug but expect the large would've been too big (5'3", 150 lbs). a great statement piece for anyone with the figure to carry it.
other Love this with leggings or jeans for a casual look. quality seems ok, though i'm hoping for no shrinkage after i wash since it's the perfect length at the moment (i'm 5'7" and it just covers my butt). good sale purchase!
other Love, love, love this little lbd!lots of rich detail and still very easy and laid back. dress up or dress down.i will be wearing this into the fall season. i purchased the l, still roomy, tried the m but a little snug in the shoulders and chest. i am usually a size 12, d cup. very flattering style boho chic.
other This top is so fun, but more importantly, it is sooooo soft and comfortable!!
other This blouse is gorgeous, i purchased in two colors and absolutely love it. just a side note i normally wear a size small blouse or size 4-6 blouse, in this i went up a size and purchased the medium.
other First, i've been in love with this dress for months. when it went on sale i absolutely had to have it! i'm 5'4" and 150 pounds and typically wear large stuff from retailer but after reading other reviews i decided to get the medium. it's more generous than i expected and wonder if i could've even gone with a small. i might try a belt. either way i'm very very happy with the dress. the sleeves are not too long - and i didn't get the petite because i wanted the length in the skirt. the lining makes
3 First of all, this top is brown and light beige. i was expecting more of a dark grey and cream. it also has very noticeable stitching that is a very reddish brown. cute, but a little different from what i imagined. the fabric is a casual linen. regarding the fit, i am 5'6", 123lbs. 27 inch waist, 32d. i ordered the other and it fit well. as other reviews have mentioned, the straps are long so the top of the shirt hangs fairly low. i did not find this to be flattering. it made my bust look low and my
other Bought this for my brother's wedding and i just received it. i ordered my usual size xs. it's a tightly woven knit, with little to no stretch in it. i could barely get it over my head and my arms could barely fit in the sleeves. and i don't have big arms at all. for reference, i'm pushing 5'7", around 12other lbs. i'm glad it's so structured because i was worried that it would lose it's shape with this material make-up. but, no. it's really fitted. alas, i need to try again with the next size up. ma
other This looks great on. i'm busty, so it's a little awkward to zip under the armhole, but not bad. a little bit tight in the bust, but the smocked back stretches to accommodate. i just wish the description had mentioned that it has silicone gripper across the front neckline. i have a sensitivity to this type of coating/elastic and generally avoid it, since it causes my skin to turn red and break out in blisters. the jumpsuit looks so great on that i will keep it and either remove the gripper or s
other You will need to get these pants hemmed if you are not six foot tall, as they are quite long.  but they are so cute that the extra alteration expense is worth it.  imagine wearing pants that feel like pajamas but that look like a million bucks.  is this not every woman's fashion fantasy?
3 I purchased the stripped blouse and it was very large around the armhole. it bulged open as if it needed a dart. i even washed it to see if it would shrink to fit and it was better but not good enough. i hate my bra showing through the armhole. it's going back. cute blouse except for that. i love sleeveless blouses with turtlenecks.
other I absolutely adore this tunic, however, i followed the label and hand washed/hung dry and it shrunk! i was able to exchange it, so i will be taking it to a dry cleaner to see how it needs to be cleaned.for reference, i purchased a regular xs...i am 5'2", 120 lbs.
other This shirt is gorgeous. i bought it for my engagement party and got lots of compliments. the only thing negative was that the particular shirt i bought had one of the stones on the sleeve that the prongs were bent so it snagged the beautiful embroidery on the front of the shirt.. of course my local retailer exchanged it for a perfect new one without hassle. it's an expensive shirt but perfect for a special occasion.
other I bought this at my local retailer store. i bought the last one and when i walked out of the dressing room a lady asked if i was buying it..uh yeah! this is so cute with jeans or pants and booties. i bought the yellow. its lightweight and perfect for work or weekend. ive received many compliments. the arm holes were small for me, i bought a size 6, normally i'm a small or xs in most tops. i am 5-2, 130 lbs, petite and fit, the 6 regular was perfect for me, i was ok with it a little longer.
other This shirt fits great. it is a fun look. i wore it wear a pair of leggings and sneakers for a casual day look. it goes down to my knees in the back and the front is asymmetric. so cute. i think i will get a lot of use out of this going forward.
other I fell in love with this dress when i saw it in the catalog and ordered it immediately. i was a bit disappointed that the dress is a little lighter than the pink showed in the catalog but it didn't deter my liking it because it's still a lovely shade of pink. the fabric takes a bit getting used to though - i thought it would be silkier but it's really a thicker fabric. i ordered a size small and i usually wear size 4. the dress drowned me. so i returned it for an xs, which fit me beautifully. so
other I love simple pull-on jersey dresses and so i had to try this one. unfortunately, it did not work out. fit is tts, i liked the fabric which is soft, silky yet with some weight to it, and i appreciated the thoughtful construction with multiple well placed darts in the chest. the skirt is lovely, swingy but not too full, hangs well. what stopped me from purchasing it is the fit in the shoulders, it was too broad for me and gave the dress an overall awkward shape. the neckline was also a little too
other Great dress for a party or a more conservative event.  love the style and fit.  a little hard to get on and off...
other This is a great layering piece. took it on a trip and wore with both a long sleeve and tank under it. is more 'khaki' color then the photo shows - which was a goo thing for me.
other I liked this sweater in the picture but was less impressed when i saw it in the store. it looked a bit odd and perhaps cheap to me. still i decided to leave it on my wish list and got it as a christmas gift. once i tried it on, i really liked the way it looked and felt! it's flattering, comfortable and looks great with jeans! it's really cozy! i rated it tts but you could almost size down on it.
other Really pretty for summer, especially beach and pool wear. but i'm only 5'other and even the petite is i think a tad long for flats (which is my preferred shoe for this dress). i'm also "curvy and busty on top, so unless you are blessed with a nice thin waist it's not as flattering as the tall thin model shows. but still it looks nice on, and i though it might look good also with white footless tights i have too. so i'm on the fence about keeping it, since it's really pretty for a summer party.
other I liked this top even though it was a definite 'swing' style. i ended up altering it to remove some of the fullness.looks great with jeans as well as black pants for a dressier look. very soft and comfortable fabric. wish it was just a little bit longer.
other I bought this top in a large. i washed it in cold water, and it shrank just enough to flatter. the material is great, in that when i washed it, the blouse hanged quite nicely, no ironing needed. also, the material is heavy enough that no tank is needed underneath the top. thakoon had made the same top last summer, and it had cost around $500. this top is even better due to the material, and i could buy it for a fraction of the price. highly recommend!
other Very warm and snuggly, gorgeous color, nice fit. i have a little trouble getting the neck to lay right, but managed so it works for work. i can't say enough how toasty it is. very good quality and styling.
other I loved the aesthetic but as a true hourglass shape, i was frustrated that it didn't have a little more give as i tried to pull it over my head. the fabric was stiff, and seemed to be lace over cotton? not entirely sure. i couldn't get past the feeling off the material.
other Chambray top that is soft, but thick/heavy so it drapes well and is very flattering on. untucked, the top is shorter in the front and longer in the back. it hangs like a tunic, almost a-line so do not size up or you will have too much material. i am a sz small in most retailer clothing, and the sz other fit nicely. sz other was too loose around my arms, and the sz 0 was too tight around my chest. nice neckline and a pop of surprise with the gorgeous lace detail in the back.
other I absolutely loved this top. it fit great and was easy to dress up or down. i wore it once and washed it according to the tag. cold water and flat dry. it is now other sizes too small and unwearable. extremely disgusted.
other This is the widest sweater i have ever seen. i laughed out loud when i opened it, and then showed it around my office and everyone else cracked up too. it is comically wide. even when i was 9-1/other months pregnant, the m/l would have been pretty roomy on me. now that i'm back to about a size 10-12, this looks like jared from subway's pre-weight-loss pants, in sweater form. ridiculous!
3 I'm an xl in retailer tops, and the xl fit as expected in this blouse. however, the elastic cinched in such a way under my bust that it did not look flattering. the cut in the sleeves hang open too much for me and makes it more of a costume. i also had issues that the chiffon type sleeves did not match the color of the knit fabric used in the rest of the blouse. the blouse is a good quality, but there were too many other issues for me to keep it.
other This is a pretty dress, but the cut is quite boxy. i had thought that the dress would cut in a bit along the body and then "flare out" more around the waist down to the hem; however, the dress is baggy from the sleeves all the way down, which lends to a rather unflattering look.
other This top did nothing for me. it billowed in the front and was not flattering. for reference, i am 5"4, 11other pounds, and small chested. i ordered the smallest size the top came in (cannot recall if it was an xs or 0). i promptly returned it.
other This dress is beautiful. this is a 0 and tts. it was not clingy or tight at all (5'4" 115lbs). it is fully lined, and i have short legs, so it was not too short for me. if you have an event you could wear this to this summer, i highly recommend.
other The sweater feels nice, but not as luxurious as some cashmere. for the sale price, it is worth it. found it a bit small, but still wearable. hopefully it will hold up well, as the zipper seems a bit delicate. overall it is a good basic piece.
other I love t-shirts by t la, but unfortunately this particular one was different. the sizing was off. it ran small, although i ordered my usual size medium for this brand. i think the shirt is cute though;)
other I am one month post partum and have had so much trouble finding jeans that fit. my old jeans fit in the legs and thighs but not my new tummy.i love my old pilcro jeans but didn't want to spend the money on jeans in a size so much larger than my norm.well after ordering other brands much cheaper i broke down...spent the money and sized up. i am normally a 27 and ordered a 30 due to waist size. they came today and fit like a glove.i am so happy! it's worth every penny to wear jeans that fi
other I ordered this dress in both colors. the peach color is so beautiful in person. i'm planning to wear this dress for our rehearsal dinner at the end of the summer, if i can hold off until then! definitely worth the price.
other I love the button details on this top. i was expecting the material to be thicker, but it's quite thin. it isn't sheer, but i will layer it for the winter months. overall the fit is true to size. i am 5'0, 110 lbs and the xxs fit me well. the arms were more snug than shown on the model and the shirt was loose without being too flowy or boxy.
other So comfy and stylish. love the color, i purchased the indigo/blue. nice fit, relaxed fit....not fitted. might have to get another color. it's fun to have a tee with a different design detail (neckline). i'm 5'7 145-150 lbs and ordered the medium. a smaill probably would have worked too, since my shoulders are a bit narrow. but mediumd is fine:)
other I bought this in store yesterday in a other petite - it definitely looks best if you can get it in your usual size (other petite just looked too big and changes the look). love the embroidery detail. it was on display with the sleeves rolled up to elbows, and it's really cute that way too.
other This seems like a simple tank, but the shape of it is super flattering. it kind of soles in at the seam, and the shoulders are just adorable and sexy at the same time. i love the detail in the straps, coloring is neutral enough, adn the fabric is very soft... i am glad i finally tried it on, jsut didn't want t pay full price, but broke down as sizes are selling out (smaller sizes, i am usually xs petite and that is gone, so is xxs, so went with xs). i am 11other lbs and 30dd for reference...
other This top looked so cute in the picture, but unfortunately doesn't live up to it! the one i received, actually has the print shown in the photo on the inside of the shirt. it makes it much darker, and boring. the shirt itself is on the short side, and would've looked better if it hit lower on the hips, there's just too much fabric for it to land higher than that.
other I love these pants! the pattern is polished and the flowy style is perfect for warm weather. i ordered a small and was worried they would be too short (i'm 5'10"), but they are just right when i wear them just slightly lower than my true waist. my new favorite summer pants.
other Love these pants . very flattering and comfortable and cool. perfect for the hot summer days.they have washed well. need ironing. the charcoal ran a little bigger and too long but the hot dryer shrank them . the orange were perfect, still a little longish so i cold wash them and hang to dry to keep from shrinking5.5' size 8
other Wasn't sure about sizing so i ordered the xl and they fit my 5'3", 153 lb frame. they'd work for any height because they gathered quite a bit around my ankles but easily adjusted to look like they fit. amazingly, they don't show the squishy bits at all. it's a substantial thick knit. i'm returning because i don't have the body for these and i'm short waisted so the top, wide, slenderizing part of the waistband starts well above the area where i carry my weight in my tummy, mid section. i highly
3 I did not have the same experience as the reviewers. this shirt is not what i thought. the front is low cut and i would have to wear something under it. i could not wear this to work, and i would not wear it in public. the fabric isn't bad, but feels flimsy.the fit is tight. i wear a small, or xs in most shirts, and this was ordered in a small and it was tight. i did like the green though, and the color in person is nicer than what is pictured.
other Amazing color- true to picture. it runs a bit large, even with layering underneath. i'm usually a 10/1other / l / 34d in tops and i needed the medium for a nice fit. i'm long-ish in the torso, and this sweater fits just slightly cropped, so really perfect with a longer button down underneath. the buttons on the back are a nice detail.
other I was leery when i ordered this as i read the reviews and i'm busty. it is perfect for me- just wear a little bandeau underneath! i'm 5" other 1/2" ,13other lbs and 34d bra size. also the length is perfect. i'll be wearing this little number winter and summer here in fl. will look just as cute with boots and long sweater! and did i mention, it has pockets!!!!!!!
other Love this sweater jacket! super comfortable and warm. i am 5'other and i got a xs petite. it fit perfectly both in length and in the sleeve. the green color is super rich and is perfect for the season. it's easy to wear it up and wear it down. i appreciate that it's not super bulky, which was what i was afraid of. my favorite jacket of the season so far.
3 Loved the style, ordered my normal m- fit tts though i thought i would potentially taper the sides to make less boxy (with a larger bust and shoulders, boxiness is unflattering). the slight boxiness looked perfect with stretchy, fitted business slacks. midday, i held my ipad up to my chest and the velcro from the cover pulled an entire lychnis delicate threads. not just snagged- i had to gently separate the threads from velcro grip. needless to say, it pulled the threads out by at least 1/other an i
other This dress is really beautiful, but the fullness of the skirt made it a bit too precious for me. i liked that the neckline isn't too low, i could wear a bra with straps with it, the knee-length hem is perfect and the back is beautiful. but the skirt is really princessy. might work for a bridesmaid or an evening occasion but i found it too shiny and girly for less formal events.
3 I first have to agree with other reviewers about the quality of this sweater: the stitch is pretty, but the fabric isn't nearly as soft as i expected. it has the look and feel of a cheaper sweater. that said, the fit is pretty flattering. i didn't have any problem getting the cowl over my shoulders as pictured by the model. i've been looking for this style of sweater, so i'll probably keep it. however, it really didn't meet my expectations for quality.
other I recently purchased this vest and unlike other reviews, i found it to be tts. with that being said, i am typically a medium in retailer tops or 8/10. i have broad shoulders (5'9, 145lbs). i purchased the medium and it fit perfect through the shoulders. it is meant to be flowy and gives some volume in a good way. if that's the look you are going for this is the top for you. had i gone down a size, i would not have been able to hook the top. i am going to be wearing this with blue jeans and white s
other This dress is really fun and easy to wear all winter. the colors are really easy to pair and like the last reviewer mentioned, i love the sheer sleeves. i was very worried about the comfort of the fabric because most sweater dresses always fail. this dress is extremely comfortable to wear. it is not scratchy at all. it is soft and comfortable for winter even indoors with the building's heat blasting away. the dress will fit the size you normally wear, however it may show lumps and bumps. i would
other Like most of the other reviewers, i agree this skirt runs quite small. i had to size up other sizes. the waist is quite small (but there are parts that are elasticized (nicely hidden)) and the skirt flares nicely and maintains a structured yet flowing drape. i bought the skirt in both colors and it looks great both with and without the tie. i think it will work nicely year round, too.
other Love these jeans. wish i could snag another pair because the fit is just on point, as is the wash. the side slit at the ankle really looks great with heels. a definite buy.
3 Beautiful - ordered a s, i wear a other in most retailer items. hand washed in cold water, shrunk inches, yes inches! love maeve clothing, this shirt is gorgeous. before hand washing in the sink, it was large and flowy. now it barely fits.
other Love this tunic, it's super comfy & cute. i have in cream and love so much i ordered in mint. looks great with jeans and boots
other This was a bit of an impulse purchase but i'm glad i added it! it's a pretty standard tank, but is thoughtfully and well made. for example, the arm holes are not enormous like they are on some tops. i wish everything fit like this. the cut at the neckline isn't too modest or too low and the fold over of the drawstrings are structured enough that they don't flop over.
other This cardigan is not my usual color choice, but the details were so beautiful i had to buy it when i saw it at the store. the birds and flowers are detailed with sparkly little beads that are prettier in reality than you can see in these photos. it's also a versatile piece that can be worn in many ways and dressed up or down. i'm only 5'1" but i didn't need the petite (which is good since it is sold out in petite). the sleeves are cropped so they don't hang too low for me. the sweater is hand wa
other This is one of those you can tell from the hanger that it's not going to work. too boxy. too short. and the girlish ruffle makes it look like an over-sized child's shirt that got all messed up in the washing machine.
other What a cute shirt! i got the red and white and it's definitely a summer shirt although i'm sure you could make it look cute under a cardigan. i'm a 10 m and the m fit well. tts.
other I ordered this in size xl in the multi combo. the fit matches the photos. it's a strange sweater but i like it. i'm glad i got in on sale though. i'm pear-shaped and the curved hem fits me oddly. i like the longer length and the mix of blues/whites/peaches so i'm keeping it. it's not scratchy but also not soft. this is one of those purchases that i probably should return because i don't love it but i know i'll get enough use out of it to justify the sale price.
other I bought this top in lavender. this top is light and smooth on your body and true to size. i'm 5'4", 34dd, 150 lbs- m fits well. it hides the imperfections in the tummy area and i find myself going for this top a lot. it's a very easy to put on and take to it off.
other Really wanted to luv this top buttt it ran small in arm length & in the front, bottom...backside was perfect coverage...also most important this top is see-through! item as pictured is not accurate!
3 When i saw this, i ordered immediately thinking it was similar to the popular colorblocked stripe sweater from last year. the knit is stretchy and textured and feels like great quality (would wash well), but it's pretty lightweight. the fit is huge...could easily size down. i'm 5'7" 128# and found the small to be loose everywhere, including the arms. the length was at my knees, and the stripe fell awkwardly across my chest. no idea what i'd wear this with even if it fit better. sadly, it's going
other Good quality fabric and structure but the mix media details and lines make them seem more like jodphurs than leggings. it's hard to see where i would wear them ... sorry but they have to go back.
other I added this to my cart on a whim, and what a nice surprise! the color is gorgeous--this dark plum color is a great alternative to grey, black, or brown. i'm planning to wear it first with a cream sweater, a mustard colored scarf, and a brown leather jacket. i am a pear-shape, and this skirt works very well to structure (and minimize!) my bottom half. it also isn't as short as i thought it might be--although i, like the previous reviewer, plan to wear this with tights and boots. the only negativ
other This dress is comfortable as well as flattering, which does not happen very often!looks good with navy tights too!
other Everything about this dress is exceptional. the fit, material, workmanship, and style are wonderful. the dress even has other petticoats to make the skirt stand out. the dress is modern in style, yet classic.
3 Ordered this in white, thought would be really cute. but didn't like, and returned it. i am big busted and it was unflattering teh way it draped.
3 I am all for a cute flowy tee but this one felt like i was swimming a bit. if you're a true xs, i'd skip this one. however, if you are able to size down i think it would look really great!
other Love this dress! i'm 5'4", 110 lbs. i ordered 2p. the dress is stretchy at all the right places and accentuates your curves. it's very well-made. i usually like loose fitting clothes, but i feel this dress needs to be snug but not tight. i tried 4p and it was just a bit loose. this dress is well-worth the price.
other I have been needing a perfect go-to white tee for layering purposes and this one met and exceeded my expectations. it's the perfect weight for year-round use, love that it's 3/other sleeves (again great for year round), and the slight front v adds a nice special touch. fell in love with the first one i bought online, so ordered a second for backup. it's a winner (and great price)!
other I bought this top to match a maxi skirt and it was pretty close to perfect.  i got the blue color,  which is more of a brighter blue than a navy.  i'm 6ft and wear a 10 top, but got this in a large hoping to gain some length in the torso out of the of a large and could have gone a size down.  the top was definitely long enough and i didn't have the problems with the gaping at the hook that other reviewers had. this is probably because i went a little larger in the sizing and i have a very small
other I will be living in these this summer! i couldn't find them in my local store, so i was pleasantly surprised when i received my grey pair from my online order. the fabric feels so comfortable with just the right amount of stretch and the cut is very complimentary to those of us with athletic thighs. i was so pleased that i bought a black pair and discovered they look adorable with my tall boots and a black boxy sweater. they've already become my "go to" pants. everyone should have a fun pair of
other Absolutely love, love this dress. it is so comfortable and falls perfectly. the material is great and you can dress it up or wear it casually. if it had more colors, i would get it it in any color it came in!!
other This dress is perfect, length right below the knee, white slip lining adds to quality, smocking fits upper body perfectly.
other This sweater was gorgeous, however, i think it was to boxy for my figure. it had to go back as it was not flattering.i would recommend this product to someone with a taller slimmer figure. i'm 5'6 14other lbs.
other This jacket is the best! definitely my staple jacket for the spring. it is so comfortable and soft. i usually wear a small in retailer clothing, but i opted for the medium in this so there's a little room for layering. even with the extra room, it is so flattering. i absolutely love this jacket!
3 Was really looking forward to this sweater, but it's not a cardigan, it's a poncho. i can't decide if it's fun-quirky or just odd. it's gorgeously made, and extremely soft, but i do wish it was actually sleeves. i haven't decided if it's something i will wear or not. my husband referred to it as "batwings." that should have been depicted in one of the photos.
other I've been looking for a great white blouse for awhile, and this is it! the tie waist is especially flattering for hourglass figures, but i'm sure it would add some curves to any body type. the fabric is soft, not crisp, and drapes beautifully. you definitely will be doing some ironing, though. it's a bit sheer, but i always wear nude bras and felt no need for a cami. i did buy the regular, rather than petite sizing and usually wear a 0 or 2, but had to size up to a other regular to avoid gaping in f
other I like this top. another reviewer mentioned that it was a great top for a busty girl...i agree. i'm a 32g and could have sized down to a small, but i kept the medium because i wanted the extra length to have the option of wearing it as a dress. the small may have caused slight button pulling, but since the fabric has stretch and the top has a generous cut, it wouldn?t look insane. my only issue is the fabric pills. i wore the top once, and the fabric near the armpit pilled a lot, especially for
other I am so crazy about this dress. i got it in the mail today and just love it!  no, it's not lined but it's not see through so no big deal. i was afraid the tie would add bulk but i look very thin. i just need to call for a price adjustment since i payed full price!
other When i saw the dress i loved everything about it except the arms made me a little nervous. i ordered it when it went on sale and it turns it the arms are worse then i thought they would be. they are like my grandmother crochet it and accidentally attached my child's dress arms on my dress.
other I got this top in white and really like it. its soft, comfortable fits well but it is a little see through.
other I just purchased this cardigan, it is better in person than the picture. the fit is fabulous, it is very versatile. it can be worn with many different options, definitively be wearing often.
other I recently purchased this tunic on sale. the cut of this top is flattering on my curvy figure as it has a cinched in waist. the embroidery is lovely and very bright with several shades of colors. i wore this with black leggings,boots and a green cardigan and received many compliments.
other This dress is so comfortable and so sexy. hugs your curves. probably would not look great on an athletic frame. i bought on sale and was a good price. i usually wear a other or other in retailer, and the xs fit fine. the small was much too baggy.
other I love this dress. it's beautiful and flattering. not to mention that it is also comfortable with a bit of stretch. i couldn't see it in the picture, but the black parts on the shoulders in front and on the back is sheer, so you have to be careful with underwear choice. i have an apple shape and yet this was flattering and the perfect length. i am short and apple-shaped and it was a great choice.
other Beautiful sweater that looks great with jeans.
other I was so excited to try these but was really disappointed in the fit. i found the legs and butt to be tight but the waist to be really big. if you are normally a size 24, i wouldn't bother with these.
other I love this tank! its something you can dress up with a skirt, or wear over jeans. i like loose fitting tops, although i have a slender frame. this is also so comfortable. i went with a size medium, and it fits perfect.
other Bought this dress for an indian wedding- it was perfect!
other These are my new favorite jeans. the gray wash is nice, and the distressing is subtle enough that i can wear these to work. the rise is high enough that i don't need to worry about bending over but not so high that they get near my belly button. and the description is true: they don't stretch! i'm a loyal ag stevie shopper, and the fit on these is similar... just a little skinnier in the ankles, maybe. true to size. a little long, so i'll probably hem them a couple of inches.
other This top flows so nice. i get so many compliments when i wear it. plus the color is an interesting blue
other This dress fits beautifully. the fabric is thick enough to feel significant and not flimsy, but the dress doesn't feel heavy at all. the detail is gorgeous, but still subtle. it's a little too nice for me to wear to work, but the perfect special occasion or party dress
other This dress is stunning in person, though the pictures do it no justice. it was overall a very clingy fit. i'm 5'3 with long legs and it was too short for me so i did not purchase, but would recommend it for those with short legs.
other I ordered top and pants online as seen. pants are of good quality and hang beautiful.  i love the color and quality of the fabric. nice and vibrant. nice fit at the top into a flowy drape. the top runs big and glad i ordered down one size. love the outfit for my upcoming island trip.
other These pants are soft, fun print and comfy. they are a drop crotch, but the cut is flattering without bunching up between legs. they are perfect for pjs all day type day!
other I have two of these tops. the maroon and tan and white stripe. the material is great and the neckline lays great. it isn't too thick so i can wear it on cooler florida days. you can dress it up under a jacket or dress down with some jeans.
other It was lighter weight than i expected but that's perfect for me considering florida winters are mild. it's more like a wool sweater than coat. the design is gorgeous, however, ran bigger than anticipated. i'm hoping an exchange to the xs will work otherwise i'm not sure i can get the fit i expect from this sweater coat. the buttons are plastic and would have made a much bigger impact if they were wooden but they're still nice. overall i love it and am hoping for the right fit so i can flaunt thi
other I'm going to be straight out... this dress is very flattering and will get you a lot of male attention. so be warned!i am a 34c and i got a size 2p. it fit's tight, but just right. i have no trouble with the buttons, at all. i am 5'4" and it comes above my knee. the material is very quality and seems as it will last a very long time. i get complimented very often when i wear it.
other I am 5'10", 130 pounds. a medium is a perfect fit for me. i love it! not so sheer that i feel that i need to wear a cami underneath, sleeves are long, and it is so, so, so soft. the scoop neck shows just the right amount without being too revealing. i am buying one in every color.
other I purchased this in the red (really more of a brick color) and wore it so much that i went back to get it in black too! i received a ton of compliments when i wore it! the fabric is a nice weight and it hangs beaufully. looks great over skinny jeans or leggings. i plan on wearing it year round!!
other I bought this in the olive green and blue a while ago, both in the small. great jumpsuit and true to size. i accidentally washed the blue one in the washing machine (in cold) but caught it before the dryer. it still fits, although it seems a bit shorter in the legs.
other I was so excited about this top, and so disappointed when it arrived today. the lace part is lovely, but the skirt part is a crinoline type fabric that balloons out at the sides. it is gathered at the sides rather than pleated, and there is no way to get it to lay flat. the back center section is pleated. why couldn't they have had the pleats all around? this will be going back with much regret.
other This is so awesome. i love how it fits. it's great quality. it's flattering. it's casual but put together. love. fits true to size. i bought it in white as well.
other Morher jeans are my favourite! they are soft and fit great. make my saggy butt look good! they do stretch with wears but shrink again in the wash. they do shrink quite a bit so don't dry all the way! i recommend mother to all!
other I love this top. i got it thinking i'd wear it mostly with jeans but turns out i have worn it with a lot more. it pairs great with cut-off shorts, white jeans, denim jeans. i have worn it tucked in with high waisted jeans for a more polished look and also un-tucked for a more casual look. i get lots of compliments on this top when i wear it. i think it could be worn into fall with a jacket over it. very happy with it!
other I love this top! i ordered the print, and it will go perfectly with blue or white jeans, and even coral shorts. very flattering. i did go up a size (from xs to s) based on other reviews, and i'm glad i did. the larger size fits perfectly at the bust and falls just below the hip.
other This dress is very flattering. i am writing a review to share my experience regarding sizing. i am 5'7" and wear 34a.  i tried on a size 0 that was at the store as a return and there was about a 3 inch gap to get the side zip closed. although i  normally wear a size 2, i ordered size other because of my experience with the dress at the store.  the size other is slightly big across the bust but looks ok. i think the size other would've been too tight.
other Let me talk about the fit. i am a size 6 petite. i weigh 120 and am 5' tall. i am curvy and have short legs. what little height i have is in my torso. that being said, i ordered the 6p and the 6. no doubt about it! the 6p fits like a 4p. the 6p was tight in the hips and thighs. the size 6 regular was a perfect fit. if you want the pant to have s cropped look like in the picture then order up a size and stay in petite. so i would have ordered a 8p i'd i wanted the cropped look like in the pic. bu
other I loved these pants - super soft and cozy and perfect for winter. i've worn them a handful of times and have washed them maybe twice max and they already have other holes! they don't say handwash and my washer/dryer is brand new and pretty gentle on my clothes. maybe i just ended up with a bad pair, but i found the quality to be disappointing :(
other Fantastic and comfortable top. i had to buy in black and white, because it was too cute to buy just one. love it. great staple for your wardrobe.
other Loved the open shoulders, but not how large and flowy the rest of it was. i could have worn it 9 months preggo ;)
other I love the idea, and color, very flattrering and easy to trhrow on, however, i need the petite in this one, and they sold out in the neutral color. it looks too big in eregular sizing, and since it combines xs/s, it is made slightly bigger. material is soft enough.
other The quality and design of this top is great and it goes well with my skinny jeans and wide-leg linen trousers. only thing is that it does need to air dry or i imagine it will shrink up which would not be good for taller frames. i'm slim, 5'8" and got an xs and it fits just right. the carbon color appears to have hints of blue/purple on screen, but it's actually a plain dark gray.
other I recommend this dress because it is beautiful, stylish and well made even though it did not work for me. i tried the small and extra small. the first - way too big, lengthwise (hit my knees) as well as in the shoulders - the latter to tight across the chest - not for me but worth a try. i am typically a small with usually never have a problem with length.
other The color is perfect for fall.  dressy enough for work, and looks great with a pair of jeans.
other Purchased this top online, and when i received it was very pleased.it has and elegant cut and yet is a casual fabric.love that the sleeves run longer......ads to the overall look.also loved the v neckline.........enhances the feel of the overall style.with various necklaces this top has limitless options!the color states moss....which i usually think of as greenish brown......i found it to be more of a taupe.would have liked it to have a green tones, however it is still a fantastic f
3 I loved how this jacket looked online and decided to order it. however, sizing can sometimes be tricky for me so i ordered both a petite xs and petite xxs (i'm 5'1", 113 lb, and a bra size 3other c). i tired on the xxs first and was swimming in it! so naturally i thought the xs would be even bigger; but to my surprise the xs fit way more snug! in the end, i still didn't like how loose the xs fit so i returned them both. the material is great quality and it's a cute design. i would recommend trying t
other I have been continually disappointed in retailer's clothing for the past year. i feel like their prices have soared and the quality has remained so-so, but dresses like these somehow make the cut. it does not make sense. since when did retailer exclusively market to older women? no, retailer's market has always been young adults. this dress is extremely matronly. although the bottom print is nice, the hot pink belt?? is completely mismatched and gaudy. i really hope retailer starts curating better dress
other I just got this in and i love it! it's happy, super soft, and will be perfect for the fall season in new orleans, since it's not too light but also not heavy. i see myself wearing this often!
other Loved the idea of these as soon as i saw them!  great mid weight jean.  a little large in the waist.  the rhinestones sparkle and i received tons of complements when i wore these jeans!  great dressed up or down!
other These pants are a fun way to mix it up from the usual dark, solid colored pants. the print is a perfect balance between subtle and bold. the fabric is soft and stretchy and i love that these pants are washable. i i'm petite (5'2") but my petite size was sold out so i bought these pants in the regular length. they are soooo long that i think even the petite size wouldn't have ended up cropped on me. having said that, i like them enough that i plan to keep them and have them shortened. i usually s
other Every year i'm excited when the weather gets cool enough for sweater dresses. i love this one, with the longer length, slimming fit and pattern placement, and cozy soft fabric. delightful, inspires reveries of castles and legends (yes i looked up what "eira" stands for and went with it). highly recommended. fit is generously tts.
other These are the best trousers i have bought in a long time! i'm 5'8 and 14other pounds and the 8 fit with a bit of extra room in the waist--not enough to size down. i love that they are not "skinny"--so over the skinny fit. i plan to wear these with black heels, white tee, and the vegan black leather jacket i purchased at the same time--oh, and a statement necklace--always a statement necklace. these are a must for every fall wardrobe! more pants like these, please!
other Tried this is my normal 4, and it fits exactly as shown. i can see how this could give issues to someone with any curves because the lining is definitely more fitted than the loose overlay, especially in the bust and hips. i found the quality to be very nice, length was slightly above the knee on my 5'7" frame so it feels work-appropriate. my only wish is that the colors/pattern could transition better to multiple seasons. it definitely feels very springy and not much else.
other I bought this as a "reward." i have wanted a leather jacket forever and i truly love this. goes with so many things; tons of compliments. soft, comfortable material.
other I love these jeans! when i saw them in my retailer store, i instantly fell in love. they fit like a dream and they look so much better in person than online. they're definitely a boyfriend fit, so if you're between sizes, go down a size. i've already gotten tons of compliments!
other I loveeeeeeee this dress! i saw it online and immediately loved the blue/ orange large floral print but so did everyone else and it sold out quick. but i thought the shape could be flattering so i ordered in the black polka dot and loved the shape! so flattering. i ended up going in store and buying the other two colors. the patterns are vibrant and lovely shape. my only concern was seeing it in store i noticed it stretching while just hanging on the hanger. i wish the fabric was of better quali
other This coat is a perfect fall to winter transition coat. it is surprisingly warm in 50 degree weather, so i'm sure it will be warm enough in 30-40 degree weather with some added layers. the only thing to note is that it is unlined and the material is soft so it may be prone to pilling. can be worn casually, to work, and dressed up.
other This is a beautiful top if you size way down. i normally wear a small in tiny tops. i had to buy an xxs petite in this top. even still there is a little extra material around the sides, but i've received a ton of compliments on the top.
other Cashmere is soft as a feather, yet warm, easy to wear and the pointelle stitches are lovely. i feel lovely wearing this and i'm really not that kind of "lady". so, if you imagine a side of yourself wanting to try out feeling lovely, bite the bullet and buy this cardigan. it does run small in my bust area, but all the rest fits well.
other Purchased in the red and love it! love that it goes with anything from work pants to jean shorts. the ruffle details add just a little extra, which makes it perfect. i just paired with gray chinos a couple days ago and it made a lovely outfit. fits tts. i wear an xs and purchased that.
other I ordered this shirt and was happy to see that it looks just like it does online -- i love the rusty orange and pale blue contrast with the navy. the navy blue underlayer is so flattering, and the sheer sleeves are feminine and lovely. the shape and pattern are forgiving. this brand is really hitting it out of the park these days. this blouse runs a bit smaller than some meadow rue. if you're between sizes (especially arm-wise), i'd order up. otherwise just get your regular size. the body is flo
other This dress is really lovely and the quality seems excellent. the bodice of the dress fits tight and that is why i knocked off one star. i am a 3other a 5'6" and 123 lbs., ordered the 2, my usual size. the top part is very snug and it hugs tightly around my neck which i don't like. i may try going up a size but it fits so perfectly everywhere else. the length is perfect it just touches the ground, no need to hem it even with flats. the color may be a bit more of a peachy color in person but overall t
other Wouldn't have given them a second look but tried them on in store of a whim. love, love!!
other This dress is absolutely gorgeous! the top portion fit a little smaller than the typical size i order. the zip side was a little snug, but the fit is very flattering! the lace detail and belted design are very pretty. the skirt portion has more volume than i tend to like, but it is it beautiful!
other I'm not one for writing reviews but i thought i would for this absolutely beautiful skirt. i saw it in-store before it became available on-line and knew i had to have it. i don't like exposed zippers but in this case the gold zipper is a nice detail on the skirt. i'm curvy with a very small waist so the fit was fine. i would definitely recommend this product!
other I wish i had read the reviews before purchasing online. i love how this top looks online but when i tried on the small that i ordered, it was comical. so so boxy. literally, shaped like a square. it must be pinned back on this model. maybe if i ordered an xxxxs it would have worked...or perhaps for a larger person, it may look super cute!just didn't work on my slim build. :(
other These jeans look better in person - the pattern is more subtle than the picture online. these run true to size for ag denim.
other I treated myself to get this at full-price at the start of summer. my size is xl and it fits me like the model photos. i have gotten such good use out of this blouse. it washes well without shrinking. it's vintage-looking. so comfortable. i love the arm coverage, interesting neckline that covers bra straps, good length. the cami it came with is flimsy so i threw it away. i use another tank underneath. i'd love any of the colors. the blus was more my color but all of them are gorgeous because of
other I bought both of these tees and they are perfect under my new fringe denim cloth & stone shirt and dress ....had to have both! the gray tee is so cute has every color of all my pilcro chinos...what a bonus. looks too cute paired with the denim shirts and is a great fall transition. i dressed up the cowboy tee with a chunky green stone necklace. i bought the small and for reference am 5'3" and 32h bra size and have no pulling so they are tts and only slightly shaped which works perfect for us bus
other Tried one at the store. love the look and feel of this pants. so soft and flowy! sizing runs large. for reference, i'm 5'4" and 11other lbs. xxsp fits just right. highly recommended!
other This bra is so well made and fits beautifully.
other This fabric and quality of the skirt are superb- there is a pretty metallic thread detail in the fabric that isn't easy to see online. however, the skirt is quite puffy, which i suppose could be good for someone with a boyish figure looking to add curves. but for many of us the extra puff might not be welcome. one would want to wear it with a tight fitting top and emphasize a small waist in order to counterbalance the volume of the skirt. could be a nice buy for the right person, just be aware o
other So simple to throw on with jeans, or you could dress it up. the ruffles give it a little extra flair. nice and soft, really comfy. i haven't decided which size i am going to hold onto. i ordered in a small and a medium. small fits me great, and i am usually a pretty standard medium. i think it just depends on what look you are going for.  wish they had it in a lighter color, like an ivory or pink.  i think the ruffle detail would look nice with a lighter shade.
other This shirt dress has the right amount of body skimming drape and length to flatter my short potbellied square waisted self, i wish they made more versions more colors more sleeves!
3 Yummy, soft material, but very faded looking. so much so that i am sending it back. if a faded look is something you like, then this is for you.
other This shirt is like the best worn in flannel with a little feminine flair! super soft and great length.
other When i saw this tunic dress, i knew immediately that i would wear it and it would become a favorite of mine. the cut is unique and it is versatile enough to mix and match with many different things. it is also very comfortable, true to size and very good quality material. i highly recommend.
other I love this sweater!!! it's so fun and quirky and shakes up a regular sweater. a little large but it fits the style.
other Great dress with just the right amount of movement and flow everywhere. perfect to dress up for a night out or wear it casually during the day
3 So, so cute. totally flattering. but the seams don't lie flat and there are loose threads all over the place. i've had issues with quality from retailer for a while (random holes in things) and was disappointed this fit that bill. i'm keeping it anyway because it's so cute!
other I did not have to size up or down because of my body type (broad padded back, wide rib cage, narrow hips, small bum.) however, it fits a little odd on me. the back darts that start at the waist and are supposed to curve for your behind settle too high and wrinkle. the waist is also too high. the shoulders are a bit tight. i am confused because i bought the exact same size pieced brocade (the colorful version of this dress) and that one actually fits spot on. i have a feeling if i go to the store
other There isn't anything i don't love about this dress! get it before it's gone! i get compliments every time i wear this dress.
3 I bought this dress in a regular xs. i am 5'3" and 108 pounds. i have a long torso so the regular would fit better than the petite. although the overall fit of the dress was good, the straps could have had about an inch taken out and the pockets gaped open! in the photo, the mode's arms are laying over where the pockets would be, which fall on the seam and when i tried this on, the dress fit beautifully but the pockets gape open on the sides and it looks like little wings from the front. the dre
3 Overall, the dress is beautiful, easy, and great quality. but the bottom part has more fabric than it appears in the photo, if that makes sense. it's not poofy or super-layered, but i had to pinch fabric on a part of the dress in order for it to have that more straight/shift shape that you see online here. besides that bottom part, the fit is true to size. but as a petit, the extra fabric isn't what i'm looking for.i think it works depending on what you're looking for. beautiful though!
other I was surprised at how soft this is. it also has snaps under each arm for definition, and on front for closure. didn't know that, and love it. got yesterday in mail, wore out last night. highly recommend.
other Love this top and the fit is very true to size. i am 5'3 and 14other and ordered a medium. the fabric weight is just right and not see through, the top did not gap and the length falls just over tummy without being too tent-like too snug or too long so can be worn inside or out. wish there were more color choices to order from. it was touted as red motif but i would call it more red-orange. i cannot wear orange but it is "red-enough" to pull off on my skin tone with the white background. the sleeves
other Bought this dress for my daughter to wear to a rehearsal dinner and i couldn't believe how beautifully it fit. fitted through the top, falling to a gorgeous flare. hit her at knee (she's 5"6'). classic, elegant, femme fatale look that will work for a range of occasions.
3 This coat is absolutely beautiful - an instant stunner. the style is very classy and timeless. it is definitely more of a lightweight coat than true cold weather wear. yes, it does run large, but that is the cozy look of it. it is not meant to be form-fitting. my one gripe is that - especially at the price point - if it's not going to be especially warm, it should at least be otherwise functional. the coat i received has pockets cut on the outside, but they are sewn shut. a coat without pockets?
3 I still have mixed feelings about this pants. the fabric is nice, soft and flows well. the fit is good, i ordered 30, could have gone with 29, not a big deal. the one thing that is off is the length - i am 5.7 and these come right to above my ankle...nowhere close to how they sit on the model. the issue with this length is that is neither here nor there, too short for regular pant length and too long for crops. i will probably have to hem them a bit, which is a disappointment when you pay so muc
other Trousers fit tts with nice thick fabric and great fit. the length was perfect for my 5'9 height. they are flattering very nice quality.
other I don't know how this dress looks on your monitor. on mine - it looks dark green. which it is! i was pleased with this aspect since i had hoped it would be as pictured despite the color description as "slate." that aside, it was a bit too large on me, and since i am on the shorter side at 5'4", i looked a bit like a child's doll in it. i wish it had looked better on me because the color is beautiful, and so is the quality.
other For once, the dress looks better on me than on the model. mine is tight above the bow and black/grey. my bow isn't this big?not pulled so much and maybe it's not knotted in the photo. it's heavy canvas and doesn't show my flaws. i'm saving it for summer?can't imagine wearing it as a jumper as in the photo.for me (5'3", 32e, 12other lbs) the bust is slightly tight in a 6 but the shoulders are a bit wide in an 8, but both look good. mine is not petite and hits me above the knee (6).the dress is co
3 This dress has very pretty colors on the embroidery, there is nothing wrong with the dress, other than the fact that there is nothing special about it. very blah fit. the fabric feels very polyester. no real shape to it. the embroidery on the dress i tried was lined up like the photo, so no problems there, just nothing about the dress made me want to wear it. perhaps at a much lower price point, but at this price point, its disappointing. size other fit perfectly, and i am 5'2" 112. in general, just
other This is the prettiest little nighty. it is romantic, soft and so very pretty. i really adore everything about this piece , but the pink detail on the trim, along with the floral embroidery is are just the right extra touches that retailer shoppers have come to love.
other I love these tights!! they're thick and durable and the pattern is super cute.
other I'm going on a cruise to the bahamas and when i saw this dress, i had to have it! i love it! it's soft to the touch and super fun to twirl around in! the seams are a bit awkward and that's due to the bottom part's shape. i have a slender navy blue belt that i pair it with to hide the waist seam and to accent my waist more. a navy blue sash/scarf/ribbon around the waist can do the trick too!
other This vest is soft, flattering, and versatile. but both pockets were sewn incorrectly, with broken seams on the bottoms so if you used them, things would fall out. i'm keeping it but had to pay a seamstress to fix it. for the price, i'd expect better quality. recommended conditionally..
other Received many compliments the first day i wore them.. amazing fit. disagree with the other post. thequality is amazing. i wish they had other colors. bought xs
other This dress is even more gorgeous in person! i had seen in the spring catalog but liked it even more when i spotted it at my local store. i have been searching for the perfect ivory crochet or lace dress each summer for the past few years. i think i have finally found "the one'! i should note i am 5'9" and this dress goes all the way to my knees. it may swallow someone on the shorter side.
other I am so glad i found this tee. as usual i love bordeaux rayon-spandex shirts. the fabric is soft and comfortable. it's heavy enough to drape nicely contouring your natural curves. it does not cling to the body, is just loose enough to let you breathe during the hot summer days. i was afraid it would look like a swing tee and make me look like i am pregnant but it doesn't. it runs true to size. the only complaint i have is that the back runs too long.
other Beautiful, well made and styled dress. perfect for company christmas parties where you want to look nice but not show too much cleavage. i wear it with a cameo brooch.
other I bought these stretchy skinny cords in my usual size 28 (3other waist, 33 low waist, 38.other hip/butt).  they are comfortable and long enough for my 5' 9" frame.  i hope they don't shrink.  the flower pattern on all the pairs in the store has the flowers running down the inside and outside of my legs.  the dark part runs down the middle.  i wish it was like the picture on the model, with the print running right down the front and backs of the legs, dark parts on inner and outer thigh.
other I love this top!! it is flattering in all the right places. i struggle with shirts the are too flowy however this is forgiving yet looks more fitted and flattering. i bought the shirt in blue and am buying it now in red! i typically buy a large or xl, in this shirt a large is perfect!
other Cute top, a little less fitted than i was expecting.
other I tried this on in store yesterday and didn't buy it due to the dolman style sleeves and the scratchy lace.  dolman sleeves look terrible on me, so this was a no go.  beware the scratchy lace...i had this on for about other minutes and was itching.  otherwise, this will wok for plenty of people - the color can be a nice neutral.  it does run large - i usually wear a large and sized down to a medium.  it didn't work for me, but i'm sure some will find it a nice part of their wardrobe.
other I wanted to love this shirt. it's not my usual style buy it looked so great online. unfortunately the actual shirt is much more brown in color and design than i thought looking online. i'm fair coloring & it just wasn't flattering. i'm thin but have a larger chest and this style just wasn't right for me. could definitely be cute on someone else but not a good match for me.
other I was looking for a top that would be comfortable as fall was approaching and this hit the mark! it isn't fitted but it doesn't look sloppy either. though it is comfy and is called a "sweatshirt" the fabric allowed me to pair it with a charcoal skirt. i am very pleased with this shirt and would highly recommend it as it can be worn casually with jeans or paired with a skirt.
other Yes, this is a bit expensive; however, it is made in the usa, so that is a very good thing. i appreciate having the opportunity to buy high quality, well-designed basic pieces that are simultaneously supporting my community and country. when you are considering this pretty top, please click on the gold so that you can see the detail. it is very well-made and flattering. i love how it has a slight shape at the back, very flattering and feminine. the feel and weight of the cotton is remarkably com
other This dress is very beautiful and looks great on, however had to downsize one size.
3 I really wanted to love this romper and couldn't wait to try it on.   it's super cute and love the material but once on the top portion is way too baggy even after cinching the waist.   if i pulled the waist all the way down it looks smoother and nice,  but if it sits at my natural waist,  the back balloons out and it's unflattering.  it's too bad,  i love the print and ease of this design.
3 I wanted to love this dress so badly. it came and the material is beautiful, but when i put it on it fit so awkwardly. there was just no way to make it look good. maybe i needed a smaller size, but oh well.
other Bought both colors in xs and soooooo glad i did. this dress is absolutely gorgeous in either color... will have (do to the nice quality) and wear (very stylish) for a loooooong time.a must have for the summer!!!!!!
other I am 5'7, the length is perfect, i can wear it with flat. normally the wide leg pants are so long, i have to wear high heels. the flow is perfect too.
other This dress i received is stylish, comfortable and very nice to wear. i love the length, goes just below the knee and i am 5'other so it is perfect for me. i can't say enough about this dress as i can't wear a lot of things because i am apple shaped but with this dress no one would ever know. thank you retailer for this beauty!
other Great tunic!  i get compliments every time i wear it. :)
other This looked like a simple, chic blouse, but the fabric felt cheap to me, like thin lining fabric. the neckline is too deep and wide as well and so not flattering.
other I'm a big fan of the "idea of" jumpsuits and rompers, but so often they go wrong. this one was an unexpected surprise. i'm 5'10", size 8-10/medium, and the medium fit well and was actually super flattering. the waist is cinched just so that it's very slimming. the roll tab cuff is a cute touch and is probably 2" higher on me than the model, but adorable none the less. great quality too. love!
other This is a great casual top for spring! i loved the covered buttons in the back, and the longer back peplum too. the peplum in the front covers the top of pants. i am 5'9" tall and often times have difficulty finding sleeves that are long enough, so the 3/other length sleeves are perfect. the fabric is light weight but not sheer, and the embroidered dots are well done.
other Very cute. love the animals on it, especially the bunnies! however not sure about fit. fits perfectly at waist but fabric expands a bit further down; it seems to billow/puff/bag in lower part, not at bottom but in the stomach area, like there is too much fabric. so it fits, but also looks like there's something slightly off. interested in hearing other's opinions about this. also i am slightly und other ft. there'no petite option but the standard stops slightly above my knees so length seems ok.
other I snagged this top with the 25% off sale and it's adorable. i got the white, and it goes great with some skinny jeans or tucked into a skirt. i found it ran true to size. my only complaint is that like some other reviewers have stated, it does wrinkly very easily. and i would say for full price i don't think the quality is worth the cost, but on sale, it's a great shirt.
other I usually don't even consider this style of shirt, but i was intrigued by its soft fabric and texture. honestly, i love this shirt! it is so flattering and a perfect staple for any closet! i can wait to wear it out and about!
other I never leave reviews for anything but this dress was such a complete miss. first off, it's about 3 sizes too big. second off, it's knitted with a metallic thread that you can't really notice in the picture. i'm usually a medium and feel an xs would be sufficient.
other What a great top!! unusual design
3 I loved this at first....but the quality is awful! it pilled like crazy and started to get little holes near the neck after 4-other wears. second sweater from retailer this year with severe pilling issues. i love retailer, but will never again buy another sweater here.
other This dress is simply beautiful and stunning. it is so figure flattering and i can't wait to wear it. size small worked for me, and since i'm tall it fell right to my ankle which is perfect for me. i could not be happier with the purchase and the keyhole in the back is a beautiful detail.
other I tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger. but it's basically cut for model-sized people only. it's short and wide, and if you have any boobs at all it'll make the back pucker. i can't imagine this will look good on most women.
other I bought this in size xl and it initially fit me similarly to the model. but, once i washed it (in cold in my machine, reshaped and air-dried), it was so much smaller/shorter. i loved the embroidery on the top. the mix of pattern colors is great too. i like when blues and blacks are mixed together. i don't know how i could have prevented the shrinking. i now throw on a shrug or jacket over to hide the shorter length. still stylish and fun.
other This dress didn't work for me at all. i'm 6ft tall, 160lb, i usually wear size l 8/10, but based on the reviews i ordered an m. the material of this dress is very soft and fuzzy, color is about the same as pictured, also length is appropriate. dress is very thick and warm, the fabric however has no stretch at all, dress is very specious and shapeless. there is allot of room everywhere except shoulders & sleeves, i thought that area was tight & snug which is strange because it runs large everywhe
other These are not only comfortable, but so cute. they are something you don't see on everyone else, and people always comment. i get so many compliments or inquiries every time i have them on. the materiel is lightweight and flowing. i love these casual, beautiful beach pants. i got a small, my usual size and they fit great. 5'3'", 130 lb.s. i wear tee shirts, bathing tops, coobies, any kind of top looks swell. get them while you can. i got the peach and black color.
other I am 5'3 and weigh around 150 and the medium fit me perfectly, hit me just below the knee cap. it's cotton/linen but not as prone to wrinkles as i thought it would be. it's double lined, made from a quality fabric. thicker but still very much breathable. will see how this holds up in kansas city's 9other degree summers but so far mid-80's it's been just fine. i'd definitely recommend this skirt. the only thing that this skirt is missing is pockets!
other I was worried about this item when i ordered it because of how it looks in the picture, but i had wishful thinking. i should have gone with my gut! this shirt does not have the same quality as all my other retailer purchases. it is see-through and flimsy. the bottom is just like the picture, it hangs in an odd rumpled way. the top is very flattering though, so it's a shame! if the bottom fit nicer like their other products i could have gotten away with wearing a cami under it to make up for the qu
other Great fabric.  nice legging, substantial fabric, more structured than a typical legging.
other The fabric and design of this piece are so unique.  i am skeptical of wide leg designs in product photos because the fabric is often much more voluminous irl than it appears, which is the case for this jumpsuit.  despite the extra volume, the fabric weight gives it a structured look which makes the wide legs look fantastic on.  there is a silicon grip band around the top that allows you to wear it strapless, though it doesn't seem very functional to me without boning or more structure to the sid
other I usually wear a other in maeve, and purchased this is a 6 in the orange. i'm just over 5'7", 34c, size 26/27 jeans. through the bust and arms the 6 fits great. i still found the front to be just a tad shorter than i am comfortable. it hangs well, though, if not a bit loose. definitely more billowy and boxy feeling in person. i think if it were slightly fitted through the waist, the length wouldn't be an issue. and it isn't even that much of an issue, but i did knock off a star for that reason. i bo
other Great top! super cute. runs a little big, i usually purchase l but the m fit better. it's thin, but not see through, so it lays well.
other Bra s great, but it has a lot of push-up padding. this might be nice for smaller cup sizes, but for a 34dd, it was a little overkill/unnecessary.
3 This dress is so cute and so flattering. i loved the shape, but i wore it wonce and the fabric was pulling on everything! just holding a purse while walking managed to pull out a ton of the fabric! when you spend so much money on something you think the quality would be better..
other Perfect shirt for a low-key day at the office. bought in the umbrella/rain (white) print. maeve blouses tend to run a little big on me but that's what i love about them. material is nice, recommend hand wash!
other The ruching on this suit is super flattering. i ordered the medium -- i am 5' 6", 150 lbs, and usually a solid "medium" in most retailer items -- though i would definitely recommend sizing up with this guy. i was able to get it on (and it certainly held everything in place), but since it is a one piece, pulling it on was a bit of a struggle and i certainly could have used about an inch more fabric from top to bottom. i will be returning and exchanging for a large.
other Great turtleneck, very comfortable and not tight around the neck at all. the material is super soft and washes well. i ended up getting all 3 colors. my only regret is that there are only 3 colors! i absolutely love this top. i also like the many complements i've received while wearing them. i am full figured and the fit is very flattering.
other I'm 5'other and based on some other reviews i opted for the regular rather than petite and am glad i did. even the regular is kind of short. if i raise my arm(s) all the way up, skin is typically exposed. i originally ordered a medium and i liked the fit everywhere except for the chest. i'm a 34dd and i felt like i couldn't move my arms. i exchanged it for a large to sacrifice some of the fit for some more arm movement. the cut is already a bit boxy so having it a bit boxier with more arm movement w
other For a special occasion, but i didn't keep mine:i ordered petite and it was short on me, too short for my comfort color is nice, rsty burgundy, i expected it a little more 'red"fastening is a little more complicated, though you don't have to make it complicated, it has hooks at each end of the hole in the back,.but: it is a nice cut, flattering to the silhouette, i might order a regualr size if i needed it. the body is structured, mateiral is not stiff, but also not soft. the arms is
other /my friend and i both tried on this shirt just to see how it fit and because it was blue. we were surprised how pretty it si on. a little see-through though, but hte cut hits in the right places (i guess we are not too endowed). she ended up buying it so i passed but very feminie work piece.
other Tried it on at the store. (must of been a return) at first i wasn't thrilled with this dress.. have a little bit of a pouch and would never think i could wear a tight dress like this. the cut was perfect for that imperfect belly. went to a other hour dinner that night and was so comfortable. not itchy and i felt very pretty in it. husband loved it and was happy for me to show my curves again. would not of ordered this online, so glad it was in store. much more vibrant in person . try it you will lik
other This dress drapes beautifully and fits tts. i purchased the green colour in a petite small. for reference, i am 5'2" and 120 lbs. rather than feeling clingy, this dress skims the body and hides trouble spots while highlighting everything i like about myself. for that reason i went ahead and paid full price with no regrets. looks fantastic with black tights and black ankle boots or bare legs with cowboy booties. highly recommend!!!
other The color and quality of this sweater are fantastic. the reason i only gave it two stars is that the height of the neck didn't seem right to me. it looked awkward and too high to be left standing upright, but when folded over i wished it were higher so it formed more of a turtleneck/cowl. i will be returning the sweater because of that.
other I ordered this sweater online in a size xs and the order was cancelled because it was out of stock. i ended up finding a sm at my local retailer and was so happy! it worked just perfectly. i'm usually an xs but the sm worked great. it is a thick knit and may snag so i'm being careful with it. simply meant to be:)
other This dress is really pretty, but not made for girls with hips. i tried on my usual size 6 and it fit everywhere but was just slightly too tight in the bum for me to feel comfortable, but i feel like i would have been swimming everywhere else in the dress in an 8 (typical of shifts i guess, but a girls can dream!). if you are a straighter shape, though, i would highly recommend.
other This was my first time to try this brand and they fit so well and are super comfortable. i love the pockets also. i am 5'1, 108 and i got a 2p and they fit just right.
other Contrary to the first review, there is a zipper so while it wasn't easy to get on, it did fit over my bust. i found this too small and high waisted, and i already have a high waist so i can imagine it looking empire waisted on a normal torso. what i hated was the ridiculous inverted pleat in the front of the dress which is almost impossible to see in the online photo. it made my already busty frame even wider and more unflattering. the lining was nice and soft and the sleeve length and hemline l
other This top is absolutely gorgeous, but i followed the care tag to a t and it completely fell apart in the wash. will be returning.
3 This is a nice dress made with high quality fabric. unfortunately i'll need to make a return as it was quite big. i bought this dress in an xs and it was too large all around. i am about 5'3" and 11other lbs and would have taken the petite, but there were none available. i'm not sure the petite would have even been small enough. the dress was a bit too long for short ladies and definitely too large in the waist and the bust (i'm small on top). it's too bad a this was a cute, and versatile dress that
other I discovered this top folded on a shelf and loved the material and this brand so i decided to try it on... even though it's super hot right now in ar. i'm so glad i did and ended up finding the other color and buying both. i am 5'9", 127#, 34b and long waisted. it is difficult to tell in the pictures how this top fits around the waist... it is snug fitting but the material is thicker so i feel like it's very flattering. i tried it on as a boat neck look, then saw online it was off the shoulder a
other In that i'm on the busty-side, i thought, "surely an xl will not be too large." ah contraire. wanted it in crimson anyway, so will try it in a large. the fabric in the white is nice in that it is substantial enough not to see-through. will look most interesting under a sweater or jacket.
other Nice length in tall.  order up one size: cut slim in body.  fabric lightweight bordering on flimsy.
other Can't say enough about the style of this trench, the material is soft and the shape is amazing for all body types. the color is great and there's some pretty aqua colored piping in the inside of the coat.the sizing is a little hmmm. i ordered a large. i'm usually a 1other on top or a large, mostly to accommodate a larger chest (ddd i think). proportion wise i'm more a medium through the shoulders and in length, so sometimes i can size down to a medium or large petite depending on the shape.with
other Well, i wanted to love it and it was just too much. i think it is a bit wider and weirdly baggier than it should be. i also feel it should be fully lined. it was not. the exterior wool and pattern is very nice. maybe if it was lined, a smaller size would have worked better, but for the price, i needed more. i also would have liked some sort of option for tightening the waist a bit when zipped up. i realize this isn't in the picture, so no expectation, but upon trying it on and seeing its boxines
3 At 5'5" (almost), 122lbs., i always wear a size small. however this dress runs large (no, i am not smaller than i was 6 months ago) and it looked like a dumpy sack on me. too bad, i really wanted it to fit! it is a slightly heavier fabric than anticipated, and would be an excellent travel dress. i may try the xs. . .
other I love these pants. i have them in the black and green. they are comfortable and look great on my curvy figure. i am 5'other 120lbs and got the size 27
other A very nice fall into winter tunic. length is long enough to wear along line as a dress with tights and tall boots. i found it true to size. the color of slate blue is beautiful!
other The fit on this skirt is flawless. i usually need alterations at the waist but this one was perfect for me. the buttons are so adorable and the color (orange) is vibrant and perfect for spring and summer. will wear this a lot!
other I bought this dress at my local retailer store on friday and love it! the dress is well made, with some heft to the yarn. the colors of the yarn, blue, white and grey, seem to shimmer a bit due to their weave, but there is no metallic thread in the dress that i can tell. i know some have written that the dress is a sack, but not on me. i toyed with buying this online and then didn't due to the negative comments about the dress; i bought an extra small and it fits well (i usually where an x small,
other Good quality; casual feel good dress. it can be worn as dress, or as tunic over the pants.
other The sherpa vest i received from retailer was the color the model is wearing.. the same hue and shade of both the faux shearliing and faux leather. i'm very satisfied with the vest. i believe it runs a bit large. i usually wear a large, sometimes an extra large yet the m/l fit me fine. shearling is very in this year and this will complete your look-wearing either pants or skirts.
other This shirt is thin and shapeless. the quality is h&m esque. unflattering. not a fan
other This dress is so pretty on! i almost didn't try it on because on the hanger it didn't look like it would have any shape. well, it is super drapey and flowy, and it looks great on, almost swing style. it is doubled up on fabric, and with the longer sleeves i was scared it would make me too hot, but the fabric is light and breathable, it will be a perfect transitional dress for fall and early spring. fyi, the eyelet strip on the front and back are see through, didn't realize that the first time i
3 I've been looking at this jacket on line and finally went to the store to try it on. i really liked the styling but the denim was quite stiff. i'd prefer a softer kind of fabric. i wonder if it would soften if it was washed. also, it ran surprisingly small. i usually take an xsmall or small but the small didn't leave me enough room to comfortably bend my arms. the medium worked better. i wonder how others feel about the fabric and and the sizing. i think i'll wait and see if this one goes on sal
other Nicer twist on the casual tshirt. soft, comfy. love the purple.
other I am 5'7" and 36a cup. i tried on the small and it fits perfectly. i can see how if i was bustier it could be a problem. it looks better in person, dressy enough for the office but comfortable fabric and nicely shaped. i love this with jeans and can't wait to wear it to work!
other Got this in the red, like previous reviewer mentioned - it does fit snug.you might need to size up if you are busty and want a much looser fit.other than that, super comfortable and soft fabric
other I am loving these. they are quite long but are prefect to wear with pj shorts or leggings. very soft and cozy.
other I love maeve and was so excited for this top which looked like an update from a last season favorite. unfortunately the fabric was stiff, it was tight in the chest and went straight down from there. returned.
other Fell in love with these instantly in the dressing room. it was more than i wanted to spend but i don't regret it. quality is great, denim is just the right thickness, i love the wash... will be wearing these a lot. just like my other pilcros!  i'm 5'8" 12other lbs. size 28 fits perfect and the length is just right.
other Oh my, i just received my dress and it is gorgeous!. i was a little skeptical with the reviews but i am on the slender side so perhaps that is the body type it works for. i am 34b with a 2other waist. i got a size 0 and it fits well. i am 5'5" and the length is good too, not too long. i could wear reasonable heel/wedges. it is a great class, sophisticated look. the material is great quality. i can't wait for an occasion to wear it to!
other Love the way these pants fit. love the length. love the cut! just the right amount of flare... normally i am a 28 or 29 in citizens jeans. i considered the 27 in them, but the legs were a bit tight. 28 was just about perfect. and the best part....they are finally on sale. i look forward to wearing them with flats or heels and a simple white shirt!
other Definitely order down a size. i am almost always an xl (big chest, broad shoulders) but the l in this fits me perfectly. well worth the sale price, a fun boho transition piece!it is a "reverse print" so the inside is brighter than the outside, but i like the blurred paisley print--it's subtle.the back detail is great and very flattering.it is quite full and flowy, but in a flattering way, i think. just restrained enough.
other I love this top so much i bought it in 3 colors. the material is so soft and comfortable. has a slight fitting in the waist to make it very flattering. you can wear the next as pictured or button it up and slouch it and it looks great both ways. perfect with jeans or dress it up with slacks. just wish it wasn't dry clean only.
other This shirt is nothing like the online pictures. it's a stunner in person. ended up with the black one though i was torn between it and the white. i would agree with some other reviewers that it has little to no give across the chest so i bought a l due to broad shoulders. the m fit like a glove and i was afraid it might tear if i raised arms or reached for something. not sure if a large busted girl would be comfortable. though i sized up, it didn't affect the way it hangs and it hangs beautifull
other I was fortunate to buy one of the last petite mediums in this style! the knit is soft and comfortable and doesn't seem likely to snag. there are a variety of stitches through the upper areas which add subtle differences. the colors are fantastic. this will be great for the cooler months. it looks fabulous with denim.
other Love this sweater! the abstract floral design adds an understated romantic touch, the red is a beautiful rich red, and the cotton is super soft and comfy. i've tried it on with pencil skirts and jeans, and it looks great with both. i'm considering buying it in the off white too, but it does have some cons. one is the waist band hits me where it does on the model and if you look closely you can see where the sweater poof out over the band a bit--it does that on me too, unless i turn the band up t
other These give an amazing slimming effect and i love the dark wash and fit on the waist. only negative is that being 5'other and a size 30 the length of the pants is a few inches too long for me. i still love them but will have to wear heels with them always.
3 This sweater is thicker and darker than it appears online. i thought it would be more of a blush color, but it's more dark gray and brown. it wasn't that flattering on me as a cardigan. looked a little cuter all buttoned up, but ultimately i am not keeping because of the color.
other Let's face it, this dress isn't perfect for all body types, but fits mine perfectly. i"m 5'5" 120(it) lbs. i love the cut and the unfinished bottom feels very causal when need be or a little more refined when needed. the zipper has a long denim piece attached to help with zipping up. the denim is soft and lays nicely. i suppose the fact that i got it on sale does make me love it that much more, but i keep putting it on. with a closet full of clothes and sun dresses in particular, i still keep pu
other This bathing suit is absolutely fabulous! it makes me feel like i stepped out of the notebook! definitely worth every penny!
other Beautiful dress! i usually wear a size other regular, or a 6 petite (if the dress has sleeves). i ordered this in the 6p and it is too big. wish i could exchange it for a 4p, but it's no longer available.
other Love this dress! bodice and lace at bottom gives is a cute layered look. there are buttons on the front (see pic), but it does not button up. i'm a bit on the "hippy" side....physically hippy, that is...and this dress did a great job of downplaying my hips. ;) i'm 5'4" and this dress hit just above my knees (a bit longer than on the model in the photo). would look cute with a jean or military jacket! i am wearing a small. 5'4", 130lbs, 32b chest.
other I love the fit of this tee for everyday wear. it's forgiving on my late 30s mom body and looks much more stylish than the average tee. my only complaint is that the fabric started pilling on the second wear. otherwise the fit, style, and fabric weight are great. it fits tts. i'm usually a size other and the small fits perfectly.
other I love the pilcro pants and so when i saw these level 99 shorts i just had to order. they arrived and are as good as i hoped. the fit is great, the length is great (i don't like shorty shorts) and i love the color. the photo is very true to life in regard to color. i will definitely get a lot of use from these this coming summer.
other The shirt is beautiful, but fits much too small. the stitching limits the space in your shoulders, and the hem too short. a petite frame would be able to pull this off- but i am a 5.10" medium, and the shirt didn't work in every direction.
other These pants are made of a beautiful fabric that really brings out the rich color. like others have said they fit almost like high-waisted leggings, which i for one love. it makes them really comfortable while the nice, heavy fabric and lovely tailoring make it appropriate for an office. i do find that the pockets are pretty useless, as having anything in them ruins the lines of the trousers. the zipper is a bit pokey as well.
other I bought this in two colors : the green which i love and the washed out look adds some interest to make this other than a plain tank. i also bought this in white and it is completely see through. i will never understand why designers don't pay attention to how fabric would look as soon as you put a bra on. if you want to wear a tank under your tank then get the lighter colors otherwise i would stick with the green.. honestly debating on whether to buy the bright blue color but i fear it's just n
other I love this shirt. i bought it in both black and white and i get compliments every time i wear it. i totally recommend this top! it's a great material and easy to wear with a lot of different bottoms.
3 Material and color is nice.  the leg opening is very large.  i am 5'other (100#) and the length hits me right above my ankle.  with a leg opening the size of my waist and hem line above my ankle, and front pleats to make me fluffy, i think you can imagine that it is not a flattering look.  if you are at least average height or taller, this may look good on you.
other This dress has a beautiful shape. it was a onesie in a store (only one they had) and i'm glad i tried it on. usually i'm a 6 or 4. this is an 8, and it's a perfect fit. definitely size up at least one dress size. the knit shoulders are beautiful and the belt is slimming. i love the writing on it. it's a classic dress and it makes me feel beautiful and unique.
other I am obsessed with the quality of the fabric on this top. i am giving it as a gift and can't wait!!!!
other Gorgeous dress. it was designed to accentuate a woman's figure. lovely material, holds everything in place without being too revealing. the dress does not lose its shape. definitely a head turner
other I love this top! it falls in a romantic and easy way.  it's very flattering and looks great.  i just had a baby two weeks ago so it hides my insecurities and post baby bump.  i had many compliments and felt so comfortable, so ordered it in the green color.  i wish there were more!!
other This bra is just as cute in person as it is in the pic! i can tell it's pretty well made and i love that it has a lot of little details like on the straps and the cute front-closure and lacy racerback. it also fits pretty true to size, which is a must for me because i often get bras that leave my boobs spilling out. however, this bra isn't the comfiest even though it looks like it would be pretty comfy in the picture.the style doesn't look too stiff or anything and the size i got isn't too tight
other I liked the way the dress looked in the front, but the material in the back was knit and very clingy. i did not think it was flattering on me.
other I have about 3 or other akemi & kin tops. i usually take a small. i think this one runs a bit bigger. the armholes are too deep and there is just too much fabric for me. (5'6" 125lbs) i am going to try to size down because i really like everything else about the top. orange is not my color but this has enough white to compensate. the pattern, button detail and fabric are all very nice.
other Fits like a dream. i have a thick middle and tend to have problems with anything that flairs out, so i was so happy that it hung beautifully on me. even though i wasn't really looking for a sweater to take on a trip to europe in a few weeks, i bought it on the spot. i bought it in neutral which is the only color the store had and after seeing the darker color am happy with it. i love the belt since most sweaters don't have anything to close them and the belt lays perfectly as well.
3 I thought this dress looked really cute and many people gave it great reviews. for me, there were a few key things off for it to work. i thought the material was soft, although not thick as you might expect with a turtleneck style dress. i ordered a small and the top fit ok, the arms were a little tight. then the larger problem was the body, it hides everything which is great but the way it fell and just sort of hung there, it didn't do anything for my figure and was not flattering around the wa
other Bought this in navy in the spring and this fall in green. i am 5'10" and 57 with very long legs and they are too short to be work appropriate as a dress, at least for me. i wear both with leggings, short boots and a variety of jackets and love them. they feel like butter against the skin and are incredible comfortable. recommend. for reference i'm about 157# and an athletic/straight build and bought m in the blue and l in the green. go figure.
other The title says it all. while the quality was good, when i put this dress on a felt like i was wearing a shapeless sack fashioned out of wallpaper. the length was longer than on the model (makes sense since i am only 5'5"), which was ok, but the overall fit was just too big. i am a size other and tried the xs, which was huge. just not flattering or breezy or sexy in any way. going back!
other I've been looking for the right leggings that are of good quality, thick enough to feel appropriately covered, and a good price point - these are those leggings! need more!
other I loved this sweater! it is a little thin, so i will probably wear a tank under it, but you could probably get away without one, i am normally either an xs or a small, and i got the xs in this sweater. the bottom is a little loose like in the models photo, but i really like it.
other Just had to review this dress because it is so beautiful. the fabric is light and soft, and is really perfect for this flowy tiered design. the colors are really pretty, not too bright, and it fit perfectly. i would say that it is much more dressy than it appeared in photos. the bodice has some beading, and it was much longer on me than on the model, though still a perfect maxi length. it would be perfect to wear to a wedding or formal affair.
other I wish i had read the other reviews before purchasing this product. label says that you can wash and dry normally. however, upon washing, the outer layer shrunk and the inner lining did not. the robe will now not lay flat; the fabric pulls at the edges, and results in the inner lining being revealed when the robe is tied shut. extremely disappointed. for a $100 garment, i expected much more. i wish i could return this.
other Love it ! ...although i had to purchase it in 3 sizes before finding the right one. it does run large. i normally take a l or el ... but a medium in this had the perfect drape ! i am 5'11" and 18other lbs and it is very flattering ! a perfect piece to be worn as a dress or as a tunic over skinny pants ... can be as sophisticated or casual as you choose to make it with accessories !
other I got the dark purple color of this top and it is perfect! i wear it all the time. it's comfortable and it's cute! plus if it gets cold i can throw a warm sweater on top of it.
other I ordered this dress online. the colors are pretty (if you like pastels) and the fit is true to size, however, it fits very much like a maternity dress. for those of you rocking a baby bump, this is a good choice. for others who are not, it's just not flattering. my figure got lost in the dress and the high waist did not look good on me. i returned it.
other Great that it's hand washable because i hate the smell of dry cleaned garmets.
other Bought the blue romper and love it to bits! definitely a summer staple. i'm 5'4", 10other lbs and generally consider myself proportioned, but curvy on the bottom, and the xs fit perfectly. many rompers have really short inseams, but this one is a relatively conservative 4-5" so i feel comfortable and can dress it up or down. i've worn it a few times and received tons of compliments. it's super comfortable, forgiving, and flattering. i originally purchased it in black in pxs and ps, because at the ti
other This jumpsuit is so pretty and fits perfectly. i am 5'2", 10other lbs. and 32c and got the xsp and the proportions are perfect. i wondered if the pattern would be too overwhelming or busy on a petite frame but it's not at all and fits like a glove. i removed the little loops that hold the belt because they stuck out too far. easy to throw on when i'm out and about with my kids or dress it up with heels or a wedge for night! love!
other Love the top! it fits perfectly. i was a bit worried it would look like a pregnancy top on me as i'm a 34dd, but it doesn't. i've received many compliments on the top, its incredibly well made and has beautiful detailing. it is sheer so you'll need something under. the material is quite light as well which is nice.
other I bought the delaney blazer in size 6 -- and i really like it. there are surprising design elements which make it a unique piece -- the buttons of the sleeves are mismatched, the back material is different from the front, it has some exposed seams. like others have said it does have a boxy fit -- which i don't mind. i also found it to be a bit short. if both of these things are fine for you, the blazer is a great addition to a casual-creative professional look.
other I absolutely love this sweater. it is a beautiful deep blue color. i love the unique cuff on the sleeves.. i feel it does run a bit big but once you pull the strings it shortens up dramatically. looking forward to late summer and early fall so i can wear it!
other I'm curvy, have very muscular thighs and am just under 5'5". i was not very optimistic when the sales associate told me i would love these jeans. she was right, they're amazing. they are incredibly flattering, just the right length for me (even tho cropped) as i can wear them as full-length or just add one or two rolls and it's a crop. the fabric is amazingly soft and they immediately felt like a favorite, old pair of jeans. the pockets are well placed so they do wonders for the bootie. oh, and
3 The top is really cute, but it's see through and the material doesn't seem like the highest quality. definitely not worth the price.
other I have this color also in the grey - flattering, interesting shirt. i have think hips but a fuller waist, the vertical lines of this shirt design suggest otherwise. great to pair with torn up skinny jeans! love the petite line now in portland.
other This is a very flattering dress that is perfect for those little black dress occasions. two other people in my family own this dress and love it, it's now my turn to add it to my collection. the dress is quite long for my 5"6" frame, so i have reordered it in a petite size for a little better fit and length. the lace is very detailed and the nude slip underneath keeps the lace from being too revealing. very elegant, a little chanel like. and by the way, the belt is included, as another reviewer
other I love this caftan! it can be worn belted as a dressier look or unbelted down to the pool or beach as more of a caftan. this is the perfect, versatile piece to have for the summer
3 1. the wide leg/crop is a cool trend. but not great on me. i'm pretty standard in size/build: 5'6", 13other lbs,, size 4. i felt like i just looked oddly shaped with them on.2. and maybe this is the issue: the size 27 (my normal size in every citizen pant i own) was about other whole sizes too big for me. i mean, i felt great about myself. but...wowza.3. when i took them to the store to try on/exchange, they don't even carry them in the store! so i just returned and will try something else.
3 I really wanted to love this dress, but it just wasn't flattering on me. i have curves and i was hoping this would hug them in a joan on mad men way (sometimes these dresses that just hang on super thin models can look beautiful in a different way on a more voluptuous woman) but it was pretty shapeless on me. it also dips so low in the back that i would have to get a special bra to wear it. might be right for a more slender shape or someone who can go braless, but it didn't work for this short,
other I ordered these in my usual pilcro petite size 6. they were impossible to button, which is interesting 'cause i also ordered the pilcro wide leg chinos in the same size and they fit perfectly, as usual. but it ended up being ok because i don't care for the speckled, slightly rough material or the contrasting piping. back they go!
other Love the bright red color. such a comfortable fit, but still feminine and pretty. could be dressed up or down. will definitely be a summer favorite.
other These leggings are loose fitting and the quality is just not there.. i am returning the item.
other Such a great purchase! the fit is so flattering to my 5'3" frame. i usually wear an extra small/small, but i opted for an extra small after reading a review; i'm glad i did. i also did not get the petite, but i imagine it would have a similar fit without the length this has. it flows, yet hits my curves in all the right places. i will say, i'm a c cup and if you have larger breasts, the extra small may not accommodate them as it is just right on me. the black is so slimming especially when pared
other This is classic retailer at it's best.  quality   style   a little something extra makes this piece something that will likely live in my fall / winter wardrobe for decades to come.  first the quality is superb, soft gray wool with a delicate floral embroidery motif on the front. military buttons down the front with a fit and flare waist on a 3/other length coat.  versatile enough to wear as a sweater or light coat for early fall. fit is generous enough to easily fit a bulky sweater underneath and lay
other Dress it up or go casual - this dress has it all. well made and comfortable where other "lace" rubs the wrong way under arms - this is super soft. cant wait to pair different shoe colors and jewelry.
3 I really like the look of these socks, and have become obsessed we over-the-knee socks for winter this year. they are very tick which is nice for keeping warm and for durability for a long lasting product. my only complaint is that they are very difficult to get over the knee. this can be a great thing, because they certainly do stay put-which is a huge problem with over-the-knee socks. however, by the end of the day i was pretty sure i was going to lose a leg from poor circulation.i am still
3 I ordered this in the orange color from online. they were sold out of petite so i ordered medium (regular). i liked it, but just not flattering. i am 5'2" and the coat was too big. sleeves were past my hands. i think because i'm "curvy" the straight cut of coat would not have looked good on me in a size small. it was a nice coat, just not for me.
other Perhaps i purchased the wrong size. i will return to a store and try on the small. the medium just looks a little sloppy on me. i absolutely love the length and the color. will likely exchange for a smaller size and wear it all spring and summer.
other The color and weave of this sweater is really beautiful and it looks very expensive. it is heavy- this is not a lightweight cardigan so save it for the coldest of days! i wore with a white tee like in the picture and jeans, and i did have to roll the sleeves up like the model. i'm not sure that i have a jacket that would fit over this sweater because it is somewhat bulky, but i am still very happy with the purchase. you could wear this at home to lounge in, or out and about for casual outings.
3 Couldn't wait for this sweater to arrive. i love oversized sweaters for the fall! unfortunately this sweater is extremely itchy that it has to be returned :(
3 This dress is adorable and well made. this brand runs on the large side. i ordered an xs and the tag says 'p" on it. it's not petite. it ran large through the hips and will need alteration. i'm keeping it because it is really cute and is well made. the material is knit and soft - very comfortable. i'm surprised nobody has reviewed this item. i probably will not buy this brand again only because it runs large.
other I am always looking for a shirt that's a little different yet as comfortable as a normal t-shirt (running after a other year old i need comfort). i bought two colors and love the vibrant pink/salmon and the dark purple (which i think it said was blue for some reason). the material is nice and the cut is feminine.
3 I am on the fence about this dress. the fabric is gorgeous and soft. however, i was hoping the fit was more slouchy like pictures on the model. it was much shorter on me that pictured (for reference i am 5'7) and the turtle neck part of the dress is kind of high and tight. i wanted to love this so much, but it is a touch off from what i was hoping it was going to be.
other Love this! easy to dress up and down, has a great length on the torso but the sleeves are about 2-3 inches from my wrist bone, i see why the model has them pushed/rolled up- which is how i wear the shirt now too. but then it's hard to layer under a coat.
other Like other reviewers have said, this is very sheer, look at the sleeve in the picture and you'll get an idea of how sheer the body is as well. the material posed challenges for it's creater because one top i tried on in the store had a sleeve that was smaller than the other, tight enough that it would have ripped if i weren't careful. tried on another identical top and the sleeves were a normal somewhat loose fit. bodice portion is much more intense pink in real life. loose, billowy, and perhaps
other This is such a great casual fall sweater. it's so comfortable, has a bit of design too it, and it goes with everything! i bought it in the grey and love it! fits a bit big
other I bought this top in black and love it! the crossed straps in the back give it a stylish twist. i also tried it in white and found it to be a little see thru.
other I purchased this in black. as in the other reviews the lace detail is a little snug in the arms but it did stretch. i did not have a problem with any fraying or quality issues. the shape is very flattering. i've been asked where i bought this several times.
other This top looks exactly as pictured, it is a little more billowy but i liked that about it. i found that it ran true to size and i am 5'8'', 128lbs and ordered a small. i am going to order the white because the cut is super cute.
other I wanted to love this top. unfortunately, the color & fit didn't work for me. i'm a 36ddd. the fit was ok, it even flattered my bust, i just felt the stripes didn't flatter my waist. this would be perfect for an athletic frame.
other The slubbed palette tee fits perfectly. it's very comfortable and looks cute with jeans. i'll be ordering more in other colors. i really like that its made in the us too.
other Love this dress and its versatility! great design concept. fabric is pretty soft, cozy, and warm, as well. i found the dress to run large. i ordered a medium in the gray and small in the rose. i did like both colors irl, but the size small was the best fit. for reference, i'm 5'6", 13other lbs, and wear a 6. the size small hit just above my knees and the sleeves reached down to my knuckles. i wore this around the house for awhile and realized that while the knit was nice and tight when i first put i
other This bra is the one. i have been searching high and low to replace my worn out comfy bra, and this is it. if you are looking for a wireless bra with thin straps that can peek out from your shirt and not announce themselves as hello bra straps, a v-neck cut (none of that scoop cut nonsense), and you don't care about trying to boost your cleavage, this bra has it all. so comfy too.
other I am 5'0", 109lbs, and the 00 petite fit perfectly. the length was great too. as one reader noted, the zipper can be a little tricky  but dont let that deter you from getting a pair of these sweet duds. it stretchs out a little as the day goes by but that is bearable.  it has a hint of pink to it too. can be dressed up for the office or dressed down.
other I picked this top hoping that it would go with the dipped horizon skirt and the color was a perfect match! i love the irregularities in the dye, and the woven back. the cut is boxy, but the fabric is soft and drapes well so very flattering. looks great with white jeans
other I agree with the other reviewers. this shirt is cuter in person. it is a flattering cut and the design is even prettier than in the photos. the color is more navy--not the charcoal color it looks in the photos. the stitching is also more colorful in real life.
other Like the other reviewers, this is my new favorite tee. it's so freaking soft, and the ribbon down the back just gives a little added flare. pure+good has been one of my staple brands for basics for a while, and i will definitely be buying more colors in this. the length is perfect for leggings, and it would be cute with jeans too.
3 Loved this dress and ordered it based on glowing reviews. ordered size large because i weigh 15other pounds and have a large 34g bust. the dress skimmed nicely over my body but the baby doll style fit loosely and made me look really wide from the side. i probably could have sized down for a better fit, but it might have just emphasized my bust. the fabric has a substantial weight and it's lined. best as a fall, winter dress. the embroidery is beautiful. i disliked the intense black color around my f
3 The fabric is very thin. it isn't see through, just thin. i would have kept this if the full length shell wasn't longer than the dress.
other But i thought this was lace or with texture, it is more a pattern on regular fabric.colors are nice, there are subtle flowers with bright colors in the pattern, the fit is nice, the 0p fit snugly enough, i don't think there was much give but that was comfortable enough. petite length did end below the knee as shown. i think it would have been nicer shorter but don't want to have to pay extra to ehm so i left that one behind...maybe on sale :-)
other I saw this in the store on a beautiful autumn saturday afternoon and was inspired for what i wanted to add to my wardrobe for the season. this blouse is just fun without being loud or overpowering. the coloration works beautifully with my wardrobe and i can wear this dressed up or dressed down; with skirts, leggings, trousers, jeans...with a vest, jacket, or sweater or on its own. it is substantial enough not to wrinkle and look sloppy, it is easy to launder and will travel well with my capsule
other I bought this dress for my engagement photo shoot and rehearsal dinner and it's beautiful! it's delicate and feminine, without being too girly or frilly. very simplistic. and probably the comfiest piece of clothing i own! my only con is that i'm a little tall and it doesn't hit me completely on the waist, but it's still very flattering.
other I really liked this cardigan. it is well made and very pretty. i will wear it when it gets a little cooler in early fall because i tried to wear it on one of these really hot days and it felt little too warm.
3 I get that it's a swing style top and supposed to be loose but it looked so much bigger on me than on the model and just not flattering at all.
other I bought this recently after trying on both the small and xs. for reference, i'm small-framed, 5'3", 120 pounds, size other in most clothes, but can't wear petite sizes, usually a small or medium in retailer tops. i liked the fit and length of the small but the armholes were so big you could see the whole side of my bra. no one wants to see anyone's bra, not even their bra straps. i'd worn a white cami in under my tee that day, so i put it on and it improved the side view, but i didn't like the white
other I'm small (4'11, 98 pounds and 34a) so the regular xs looks like a baby doll dress on me.  i just wear the tunic with a tank top underneath (or i can wear the tunic by itself) and leggings plus a pair of boots.  the top part is slightly baggy so if you want tight fitting, is size down to xxs.  i got the yellow flower and white + grey one and plan to get the navy one soon.  the quality is good and you can machine wash it with cold water.  i plan to use a tide sweater garment bag to wash it (i put
other I'm petite, short waisted and slim hipped but with broad shoulders. the byron lars pencil dresses fit me perfectly so i was hoping this pencil dress would too (though with this brand my sizing fluctuates). unfortunately, the cut of the shoulders made me look like i had hammy arms. it was a little tight around the waist area and i could have probably gone up a size for a better fit width wise. length wise, however, it would have been too long for my torso, which i run into a lot. too bad.
other This blouse is lovely. i ordered a large because so many blouses run small for me, but am returning for a medium, as it fits pretty loose. i love the tie. its unique and feminine.
other These pants look beautiful when you first see them. it goes downhill from there. the waist is very small in relation to the rest of the pants. it felt fine when pulled up, but it is a struggle. i could get past that, but when i looked in the mirror, i could see right through them. no lining and not very thick material for this price!!! a real bummer, especially since it was a birthday gift.
other At first, i thought this top was going to be stiff. i am pleasantly surprised by how soft and flowy this blouse is. it's lovely cream color with beautiful lace details. i appreciate the lining inside the bodice which means i can potentially go bra-less when it's hot! i'm 5'2'', 135lb and retailer size s usually gives me plenty of room because i have a small upper body. but i feel this top is slight short on me. that might be because i didn't wear it off-the-shoulder but had it hang from the top of
other I ordered both a small and a medium because i have lost weight and seem to be in between sizes currently. lately i am anywhere from a 6 to a 10 in most retailer sizes. almost 5'4" and @140 lbs. i could have gotten away with the small. but my bust size is 36c/d. the small fit but didn't hang as well or feel as comfortable around the chest as the medium. i agree with a previous reviewer that this romper does have a tendency to hang awkwardly at the waist until and unless you pull the drawstring tigh
3 Cute little dress fits tts. it is a little high waisted. good length for my 5'9 height. i like the dress, i'm just not in love with it. i dont think it looks or feels cheap. it appears just as pictured.
other The price is high and i have to dry clean this? no thanks.
other I got this coat to throw over slacks at work with the ac, and it's perfect. the picture online is less flattering than in person. found that the medium was too large in shoulders and arm length, small was right for 140lb, 5'8", typical size 6.
other Could not resist the fit and detail on this piece - couldn't wait for it to go on sale. the material is so soft and comfortable. it's "just" a black sweater - but the neckline and back details make it unique! thought i would need a large but the medium fit fine. 5'7" 147 lbs
other This top is so much prettier in real life than it is on the model. the pattern and texture are both lovely, and the peplum is surprisingly flattering. it is definitely on the short side, but i think that gives it a modern look. the fabric does not stretch at all, but i still think it fits tts. if you have a very large chest you may want to go up a size, but otherwise i would order your normal size.
other Very pretty top. runs a bit large (i generally take an xs and the xs in this top fits me a little longer and larger than on the model). comfortable and easy to wear. nice cut with angled front and bit longer back. did develop a small hole very quickly as some thinner and tissue tees do but hoping that's unusual as i did buy two different colors of this tee shirt and will be totally disappointed if this happens to both, especially at this price.
other Great causal tank! the back is a bitter longer than the front - i'm 5'6" and the back-model shot was right on for where it his me at the hip/butt. the material is a poly/spandex/rayon mix that feels predominately like polyester and rayon and has a little bit of give. i go between a medium and small in most retailer tanks and like to achieve a look that is somewhere in between form-fitting and flowy (quick stats - 130 lbs, 34c) and the small was perfect without being too tight across the chest.
other This is a beautiful blouse however it runs big. i order the small and had to return it. my measurements are 5'other 13other 34c-28-38 for reference. you will not regret buying this blouse but it has to be the right size if not it would look like it did on me, frumpy. i kept taking it off and putting it back on trying to make it work (because i liked the material that much) but if you look at the model she has her arms straight down. when i lifted my arms i had 3 inches of extra material on both side. th
3 The lace on this top is pretty, and i liked the way it was styled in the product photos, but did nothing for me on. between the loose sleeves and the boxy cut of the front, it just sort of hung shapelessly on me. i also found the back to be much shorter than 30.5"--it came to a few inches below my hips and was not tunic length like i expected. the shoulders fit me well, and because the top was boxy already, i didn't want to size up for length. for reference i tried on xs (i'm 5'4", 120 lbs).
other Bought this shirt on-line. wanted to love it but just couldn't. i ordered the xs and it was huge and way too unstructured for my style....just didn't have enough shape. had to send it back.
other The fabric of the pants is a great thickness so the pants have a very nice look. the fabric is smooth, not jean material. for me this is nice because though they have weight to them, the pants are not hot and can be used to dress up or down, much more versatile than jeans. these pants are very fitted through the hips but then fall very nicely. i am not a big fan of capri length yet i really love these! i have already enjoyed wearing these out and they look fabulous with any type of wedge or heel
3 I ordered this online in the cream color and because some of the reviews mentioned the shorter back, i went with a medium, but that ended up running too big. i typically wear between a other and a 6 / small and medium so i'm always on the fence about which size to get. i often order both online and return the one that doesn't fit as well, so i wish i had this time too! the detail on the front is super cute and i didn't even mind the plainer back, but the sleeves went well past my wrist and i felt li
other Mine came smelling like gasoline. not sure why, but i would have kept it otherwise. it's a smell that will be really hard to get out. looks like the picture.
other ...there's enough room for a small family to live under the chest and trunk area of the blouse! sorry-had to say that! all kidding aside-since it's been thirty plus years ago since we were wearing these, many of us have forgotten what peasant blouses truly fit like. this is no exception- it is very billowy, flouncy, and roomy-more so even than today's peasant styles, i think. it is lovely and quite fitted across the chest -so that's how i ordered my size and it worked. i think if one sizes down
other I had my eye on this piece since it came out, but thought it was a little pricier than i like spending... but it finally went on sale. alas, all the petite sizes are gone, but i decided to order the regular xs anyway. (the length quote is long, but i figured maybe with heels?). then the xxs became available and i snatched that too...so glad. the xxs fits better and isn't as long (i have to wear heels, don't get me wrong, but the xs was still long with heels). it is soft and lovely, the xxs linin
other I purchased this top in both colors while on sale. it fits true to size. the material is heavier than i expected, but that just means it should hold up for a long time. recommend
other Very quick delivery. ordered sunday and in my mailbox tuesday before noon! nice fit, length is perfect. i'm 5'3" and the regular size 6 hits just above the knee. one thing is the nice little button in the back fell off just as i was going to try it on. found on the floor and i will just sew it back on. other than that i love the print and everything about the dress. true to size. ?? retailer
3 I wanted to give this a glowing review but i ended up returning this cardigen. the folds on top added too much to my frame. i do not suggest this for heavier apple shapes. for all others, it is incredibly soft and warm. the tan color was weird but they others are simply gorgeous.
other I so loved this dress online. not so much in person. first of all it didn't fit my build. i'm 5'4" with a 32f bust and the waist line was just a bit too high to be flattering. mainly i'm returning it because of the fabric. the petticoat netting does rustle as another buyer pointed out. my main fault is that the top fabric is synthetic and cheaply printed. basically it's the lining fabric of a better made dress or coat. if it were cotton voile or silk it would have been beautiful. why they made i
other At 5'4" i typically order petite clothing...i was unsure of this dress/tunic-shirt from the photos online, the reviews and the hi/low hem. i ordered xs and pxs (about 118#). both fit as far as shoulders and through the body but the pxs was way too short on me to wear as a dress without any leggings. the length of the regular xs works great and i feel is appropriate for someone my age! it is buttery soft and so comfortable. i ordered the suede wrap belt to go with it. also, the sleeves are too ti
other I wanted to love this top. perfect weight, length, and shape. unfortunately, the seam goes right through the bust and just does not look right. if you are tiny on top, this will be lovely on you.
other I was really looking forward to receiving this blouse in the mail. the color was beautiful in person and the photo does not show the nice beading around the neck. that being said, i was so disappointed in the fit. i ordered a size 00 and the arm length was way too long yet the body of the shirt was way too cropped. cropped enough where you could see skin on the sides. made no sense! hoping to order a few more sizes to see if i can find the right fit. order up for length, down for arm length ...
other I initially purchased this shirt in the grey motif color, size l (my usual size, i'm 5'8" size 14). unfortunately i found the shirt very roomy, but loved the pattern and style. so i ordered a medium and much to my surprise it fit much better. i'm very happy with my purchase.
other I tried this skirt in my usual size s, and although it fit, it was too short for my liking and made my hips look wide b/c of the way it billowed out. the size m looked much better- hit me right below the knee in the front. (i'm 5'2") my skirt is much more high-low than the picture. also, it sits much lower on my waist, which i like. i bought the blue, and with the color variations, it is gorgeous- reminds me of a chambray or denim coloring. i rolled it up to take on vacation, and it traveled rea
other I got the blue print and i love it. easy to match with any bottom really. i like that it can be made strapless.
other I love these pants the only thing i would say is that they don't run small! i read reviews saying they are small in the waist so i ordered a size up and ended up regretting it. other then that i love them
other Wow. bailey 4other knocks it out of the park with this sensual, i-am-woman-hear-me-purr body-slimming dress. we all have our hang ups. this dress forces you to see all the beauty that everyone else sees. the rouching covers up any dimpling or rolls you think you have. the body conscious structure lets you see those curves you knew existed but deny yourself from loving. oh - you hate your arms? me too! guess what - you don't even notice them because you're so focused on how amazing you look. the cut
3 I really thought i would love this dress the style is really nice and the material is great. however, the length made me feel like i looked short and kind of stumpy. i feel like this dress would look really good on somebody that is more like 6ft, not my 5'6" self.
other So soft, warm, and comfy! the colors are absolutely beautiful and represented accurately in the photo. i went with a small based on other reviews, and while it fits, it is slightly big. i probably could have sized down for a more tailored look but i like the extra room and think it still drapes well without looking bulky. for reference i'm 5'7" 11other lbs (33-25-33) and mostly wear an xs/other in tops. it does shed which is not a big deal to me but might be a deal breaker for others so i thought i woul
other Love this dress and so sorry it's not available in xxs. tried on today in store and the xs was very large in the upper body. i normally wear a 2-4, so this was surprising. if you happen to need probably size 6 or larger, you're in luck!
other Beautiful lightweight cardigan. the sheerness is really pretty. ordered one for my sister too!
other I purchased the grey color, and i love love love everything about this dress. the fabric is so soft and feels like pj's. i'm just shy of 5'9" and the length is perfect for work. i purchased the medium, the fit was perfect for me (size 8, 138 lb).highly recommended!!
other I'm not nearly as tall as the model so these hit right just right for flats. i love the fit of the wide leg and found the color matching the photo and the light color cords very soft. i did try the blue color on at a different store and found them a bit short. i'm really pleased with these and the sale on sale certainly helped.
other Very flattering cut.  very loose & flowy.  runs a little big for a small but fits well for someone who sometimes fits medium depending on the cut.  i need to wear a bralette with this top.
other I normally wear a medium in retailer dresses, but ordered a small due to the reviews that stated how large this dress is. they weren't exaggerating!!!! the small was way too big for me, and the xxs and xs are already sold out. beware that you will have to size down at least other sizes to make the dress fit similar to the model pictured. it is going back for me!
other I bought this top for my mom for christmas. i wasn't sure if she would like it, but it is really nice in person and she loved it. it fit true to size and can be dressed down, as it is on the model, or dressed up. i am so glad i decided to get this top. highly recommend.
other Loved the design but jacket looked like 20 years old because of a lot of piling even brand new jacket at store. i wish they use better quality fabric so i would have purchased it.
other Love these jeans! they are the perfect relaxed fit; not too baggy, and a straight style. i did size down, because i wanted to wear them as shown. i was afraid that they would ride too low on my hips. glad i did! i usually wear size 29/6 and took a 28 in this pair. the color and denim weight is also great.
other I bought this in the store so i didn't know that it was actually a sleep chemise. i kind of wondered if it was supposed to be a super-short dress but the salesgirl said that it was a top so i tried it on. the price is shocking but i'm a teacher and this month (july) teachers get 15% off so that helped a little bit. when i tried it on, i absolutely loved it. maybe i look like a cupcake but i'm a very happy cupcake with tassels dangling from my sleeves! who doesn't love tassels?! this is just a ve
other I tried this in the black and white in the store. the material is very thin. you cannot wear the white without a cami which defeats the purpose of wearing this tank in the summery. the arm holes are cut very inconsistently. some are very big which creates a very unflattering gap under the armpit. others are cut fine. i tried on 3 different smalls in the black and found one that was cut just right. this does fit snuggly, but is more flattering that way.
other Aesthetically pleasing and very well-made. love it! but, does run large.
other Got this in the sky color. returned it because the top is way too sheer for me, if you know what i mean. i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids. no can do. also, for the price, material just felt flimsy & cheap. it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i'm 5'2", 114#, 34b
other I tried this on at antho today and loved it! the pictures online are not doing this garment any favors. it is flattering in person. the fabric is a light fabric-i was a little disappointed in this since i like things to be a little warmer, but this is probably better anyway with spring coming (it is coming, right?-today it's snowing) i like the under-layer that is kind of silky which i think adds a special touch to it. it is versatile and could be paired with anything.
other I was really excited after finding this top online and reading the reviews; the combination of peplum, cap sleeves, and color seemed too good to be true. i ordered a size medium but unfortunately, this top is on the short side so wearing it with pants or jeans did not work out. in addition, the fabric was more sheer than it looks in the picture and the v-neck in front dipped a little lower, too. a camisole might have solved both of those problems but i didn't bother. i returned it to the store.
other I saw this shirt on a friend and had to buy it right away! it has the comfort of a regular tee but the frills at the bottom give it that retailer look! true to size.
other I love the beautiful flowy material and design. definitely runs a bit large. i ordered an xs and it needs to be taken in as well as taken up. i would have ordered the petite if it wasn't out of stock, so the length is probably fine for most. shimmery detail is beautiful.
other My new favorite cozy and stylish "go-to" piece for everything from park with the kiddos to mat class to impromptu financial meetings.
other This was such an impulse buy- i bought it online during a sweater sale- and i am so glad i did! this is definitely one of my favorite recent purchases. it definitely seems more like a coat than a sweater, but it is lightweight. i ordered the red and it is beautiful. it looks great buttoned or left open and i think this could be dressed up or down (though it does have a hood, so that gives it a slightly more casual feel). it fits true to size- and it is definitely shorter in the front than the ba
3 Probably should have returned this but it's just so pretty. i got complements from strangers the very first time i wore it but it's extremely long. tucking it in will be tough-where do you put all that length? aside from that it is beautiful. the embroidery is soft and delicate light blues, gold, neutrals. hard to see in the pic but there are textured polka dots all over the shirt. great buy-i just wonder how i'll wear it or if the length will be too much and it will become a 'closet sitter'.
other I was glad that i was able to get this shirt which is really more of a spring/summer item, but i found it wide in the body and the shoulders.
other I had been looking for a new plaid shirt for fall. this one is perfect! the yellow is muted, but i really like it that way. other reviewers have commented on poor quality, but it doesn't seem that bad to me. definitely recommend!
other This is a fantastic maxi -- it is very flattering, you can wear a normal bra with it (for me, very necessary) and the added ruffle makes it perfect. its a casual fabric but because of the contrast in fabric can be dressed up easily. i am other foot 1, 123, and curvy on top and ordered a small petite. in many antrho maxis i go down to an xs, but in this one the small felt the best -- more comfortable around the waist. will get tons of wear out of this -- have already taken it on a trip and wo
other This is the worst shirt i have ever tried on from retailer. it is basically a big shaggy box from the front, and from the side it looks like a tent. it is also short.
other These are incredibly soft and comfortable. they are only for inside lounging, because they are a bit see through and have that long-johns type of material on it.
other I love this sweater but i'm on the fence about keeping it only because i haven't figured out a way to layer and wear it. it really does appear best with a plain white top and jeans. i've tried it with several other things in my closet and just haven't found another combination that sells it for me - i really like my pieces to be more versatile so i can mix and match them into other outfits. this piece is just enough of a "statement" that - for me - wearing it with more simple clothing staples is
other I saw these in the connecticut retailer but didn't want to pay full price. the very next week, they went on sale! i ordered xs (i'm 5'4, small frame, 120lbs). while the length is perfect, the waist is a bit tight for pjs. though, not tight enough to return as i love everything else about these. they're like wearing a painting of fine art! light weight flannel. hope they hold up well iin cold water wash!
other This is adorable but if it truly has to be dry-cleaned that is deal killer
other Ok, so to be honest i just bought these two days ago so as far as wear and tear i'll have to get back to you on that but i seriously think i will just live in these. first they are so so comfortable, soft material, stretchy but not so thin that they accentuate every little curve but also very flattering. i'm 5'4" 127 lbs, curvy in the bottom with a smallish waist and purchased size 28. there is a little bit of room, which i'm happy with, so they don't squeeze the love handle area or make it unco
3 This just wouldn't lay right on me. the top is really too big. maybe if you're really busty, this is great, but not for me. i know the top is supposed to be a bit blousy, but it was huge and droopy and unflattering (not like in the picture). the arm holes were too big and hung down so you could see my bra, which i really hate and which is way too common lately. the bottom half fit perfectly, so sizing up or down would not have helped. the material is super light and comfy, which i liked very muc
other I saw this dress online and really wanted to love it... unfortunately it wasn't at all as expected in person.as the previous reviewer mentioned it is extremely itchy material, which was already pilling on many of the dresses displayed in the store. the neck was extremely tight; a problem i've never encountered with any retailer dress. additionally it seems to have a kangaroo pocket located right underneath the bust line, which protruded in an unflattering way. the pocket is not at all not
other Drapes very nicely and runs true to size. easy to wear alone or layer a jacket/cardigan over. i purchased this on sale, and it was a good buy. i am 5'8" and purchased the size m, as i am a pretty true size 6.
other Great boho chic top. a bit over - sized but soft and love the colors!
other I tried this on at the store in the regular size it came in and thought maybe it has some potential is i ordered it for me in a petite since that's what i am. i ignored the package when i first got it thinking it wouldn't really look right but omg, it's 100% amazing and flattering. wear it with skinny jeans, leggings, jeggings, whatever and it's just super awesome on dressed up or down. i'd buy this over and over again without a doubt.
other Got this for work (my style is casual to boho) and it turned out to be my go-to cardigan.the color is soft and pretty. it drapes perfectly. got the x-smalland it fits beautifully. plus, the weight of the knit is just right forchilly evenings. would love to have it in more colors!
other Love the lace cut out detail on the sleeves which is initially what attracted me to this sweater. just be careful with the threads. the sleeves are long but are supposed to be, as in the photo. comfortable material with nice weave, flattering cut. i bought the ivory color in xs for my 5'2" 11other # straight frame. not too long
3 This was really billowy but not in a good way. i had to return it. looks great in the photo but not so much in person.
other I couldn't wait to get this top in the mail since they didn't have it at my local retailer, but i was so disappointed in both the quality and fit. the white is completely see-thru, i can't believe how sheer the material is - especially for the price. even as the shirt is lying down, i can see through both layers of it... the fit runs small, and short.
other If you're a curvy girl like me this shirt is very flattering. hangs nicely in the front, not too clingy. also has that accordian back which is very nice because it hides my back fat. the plum is gorgeous! was king it for the first time so can't yet comment on how it holds up with washing or whether the back retains its accordian loom with the hang to dry recommendation.
other I loved this top . it is exactly what i wanted,
other This is a beautiful shirt. dressy, imo. it's tts, i would not size down in this shirt. can wear w/ black, white, moss, khaki, jeans, etc... love it.
other I feel in love with this shirt online and purchased it right away. this is one of the those pieces that makes retailer my favorite place to shop... stylish, unique and beautiful. it is a bit full in the bottom so i sized down from my normal s to xs and am very pleased.
3 Very pretty dress. the color is much brighter in person - a little too bubblegum pink for me. i love the way the bodice fit but there was just too much material in the skirt which made me look hippier than i am. would have preferred the skirt to have more of an a-line cut
other Saw this in the store and had to have it after i tried it on. it's shape is unique, it's very "floaty" and looks awesome with skinny cropped jeans & chunky sandals. the "empire" does hit across the breast line, not below. i thought it added to the different shape, & didn't look odd on me. i am 5'6" so it might overwhelm a petite frame.
other I went back and bought this dress after a sales associate told me that it was super cute on but didn't look like much on the hanger. i'm 5'3" and curvy and the s fit great. it will look great with boots or booties. it's very comfortable and nice quality material.
other When i saw this sweater online i honestly didn't think it was really anything special. however, when i saw it in my local retailer store i really liked the knit as well as the color (kind of an off white/ pinkish) i decided to give it a try. i have to say that i really like this sweater a lot. the cut is quite flattering even though it is baggy and it is very soft. i think it will look very cute with a pair of skinny jeans and boots this winter. glad i decided to give it a try.
3 Loved the fabric and details. the cut was a tad looser/bigger than i expected.perfect dress for fall.
other This is the second top i have purchased in this design, the first being in the navy blue color. i loved the effortless swing of this shirt and the comfortable cotton texture, that i chose to purchase it in wine and have since received many compliments on both the shape and color. this is an easy top for me to put on and feel good within.
other I love the built in layers of this shirt. it looks great layered with a long sleeved shirt underneath for winter also. being a teen in the 90s, it reminds me of a little bit of grunge, but in a less brooding more classy way. if only i still had my doc martins... i find the fit to be great, slightly loose, but not baggy and the fabric feels light but not fragile.
other My husband bought it for me and i was a bit skeptical at first. tried it on and absolutely loved it. besides the really soft fabric, it has pockets which makes it even more comfortable for me! i'm 5'8", 123lbs. and flat chested. he got me a medium, which fits a bit tight, but my husband likes it so it's a keeper!
other Great layering top! love the color- grey striped, matches almost anything. the sizing is perfect and the material is nice and think but not so chunky that it adds pounds to your frame. interesting detail with the snap neck looks sporty and jeeps it from being just another basic turtleneck.
other These pants are super flattering. they can be worn to work or on the weekend dressed up or down. they are slimming and fit very nicely. my only complaint is that they start to look worn, the black fades, as you wash them over time. please don't stop carrying them!!
other Can't love this dress enough. i have to force myself not to wear too often. i get stopped every single time i wear it to get complimented. i'm usually a size 6 or 8 in dresses. went with the 8 after trying both on. i found the arms fit better with the 8. i'm pretty athletic and 5'5' around 140 lbs.
other Great little black dress for cooler evenings with boots, or dress down with a pair of flats for daytime. perfect fall dress!
other I love this top. other reviewers have mentioned the softness of the material and the cozy, perfect for fall/perfect for the sf bay area "winter", but i would like to call out my favorite element of the top being the scoop in the back. it adds just a little bit of soft sexiness while being just right for a comfortable weekend sweater to a dressed up office appropriate shirt.
other Just picked this up in black in the store. on the hanger it looks like just another v-neck tank, but it is quite flattering on. however, the v-neck is quite exaggerated and loose, i will be pinning it so it doesn't sag open. :)
other It's a cute top. i agree with the other poster that the neck in the front feels a little restrictive.
other The embroidery is gorgeous! it's a lovely blouse--soft, lightweight, and of quality material. the only problem is that it is an oversized fit--running at least one or two sizes too large. it is enormous! i ordered it online but will return it and shop for a much smaller size in the store to guarantee proper fit.
other So cute, so comfortable, so pretty - so i guess i love everything about it. it is not too short on me and i think you can wear it in many ways... thought of adding a vest - thought of boots - can't wait to wear it. i agree the material is substantial so it isn't flimsy for fall or winter. happy with this purchase. runs true to size. i went with the op. i sometimes chose regular length, but this one is just right in the petite. i have long arms but these sleeves are just right. i am other ft. tall, b
other I have always love tracy reese products. this blouse is really fun, nice fabric and the proportions are perfect. but why does it have to show the wide band of my bra across my back? the cut out dips low so i can't imagine a bra that would work with it. it's a 70's hippy themed blouse- maybe the designer expects us to go braless? unfortunately i'm going to have to wear a cami underneath it. my girls need support!
other This is a beautiful dress! great and flattering fit, comfortable, adorable print (the blue is stunning), and nice movement. one can't really see it in the photos, but the skirt is actually pleated. imo this adds interest and originality to the dress. i've been getting lots of compliments. get it while you can!
other This is baby soft and a great basic. i ordered my normal size large and it clings in an unattractive way so you might want to size up for a better fit if you're not going to wear it as a layer. the black color is saturated in a good way. it's also very long but i'm short so this would be perfect for taller frames.
other This top hangs very nicely on me. i got the blue and have received compliments every single time i have worn it. it may help that i'm tallish with long legs. i usually wear it with black leggings and ankle boots. love, love, love it!
other This dress is just lovely. beautiful drape, comfortable material. it is a print that looks like embroidery. i am usually an xs or s, and i'm glad i got the xs as i can tell the s would have been too large. the back waistband is elastic and it is easy to move in. beautiful neutral colors. i think it can be dressed up or down easily with the right shoes and jewelry. only negative comments- there is only a half slip and i wish it was lined more, although that will make it easier to wear during the
3 I loved the way this top looked in stock photos. the colors are bright and cheery and it's a great transition piece. but the way the sleeves are cut almost makes them feel like water wings (if that makes sense)? they are stiff and wide and awkward. i've worn this a few times, hoping maybe the sleeves would relax down. they haven't. maybe it will look okay under a blazer for the office or something.
other This is probably the softest, most flattering hoodie that i have ever worn. i can dress it up or down and it has drapes really beautifully. great for spring & summer, love it as a coverall at the beach. my partner rarely compliments my clothes and actually told me how much he liked the way it looked on me. highly recommend.
other I absolutely love this top, i purchase this brand frequently because the designs are simple, yet unique and cool. i'm 5'7" 170 lb.s curvy/athletic and i got this in a medium, it fits perfectly and looks really great on! i love the asymmetric cut and raw hem... wish it came in more colors!
other I got this in the dark coral color. it is lovely. i'm taking it to hawaii!
other It's no surprise that this sweater coat is getting five stars. it's beautifully made, has a fun pattern, and fits great.i purchased the xs (regular size). there weren't any of the petite sizes left for me but the xs fits perfectly. the sleeves hit at my wrist (i'm 5'2") while the length hits right at the top of my knees. i did notice that the shoulder width could be too tight if you are a more broad person.the colors are accurate to the website and catalog. this seems so extremely versatile
other I tried on the xs and the shoulder are fit, but the body seemed so wide on me, it took me over... i don't know if xxs would have worked, but it is not available (and petite either). fabric is soft enough for denim, color is nice, overall, really pretty dress, just unfortunately big.and i have wide shoulders.30dd chest, 26.other in wasit, big legs, 11other lbs.
other Love this print and fabric! its soft and comfy with adjustable straps. so pretty and feminine!
other I love this dress! my bra straps do not show in the back. you can slightly see them in the front but wearing black or nude gets you around this problem. i love the slim design-it is very flattering. i tried this is my normal size other but also the other petite. the petite did not work for me since there is a larger fabric cutout for the butt area-this was too high and above my natural waste. because of this, i opted for the slightly longer option where the extra fabric was surrounding my bum. this does
3 Note: if you have a large chest, the seams hit in an unflattering spot. nice shirt, just not great for the price.
other I'm 5'other & the length is fine except i'd probably hem if i used for yoga/pilates. but i prefer cropped for those activities, so these are just knock a round lounge pants for me. they are thin, but not in a cheap way. i don't understand why they're called french terry became that's not what i see/feel; but they are sumptuous & soft. i like that the fold over waist part is stitched & keeps its shape. for size reference, , i got the black xxs- i'm 11other lbs, athletic apple & they fit/look great & clin
other Beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop. so much cuter in person. love these!
other I wanted to love this. the color in the picture is pretty true-to-life. the top fit well, if a bit smaller than usual, but the skirt piece was way too flared for my petite (5') frame. it was too voluminous compared to the top of the dress. the material is very soft, but thin, and is lined, which was a pleasant surprise. sadly, a return for me.
other This cute dress has a built in slip, so no need for a slip . i think it has a flattering fit and the colors are pretty!i feel like i could wear this dress to a shower, out to dinner, or just for a fun look to shop on a nice day!
3 I'm 5'other and 10other lbs; normally a size 2other petite for most jean brands but learned after receiving my online purchase that these jeans run large. i exchanged them for a size 2other petite and thought they fit okay at first but after testing them around the house, they kept stretching and i felt like they were going to fall off my waist! didn't want to wear a belt with these because it distracted from the relaxed style. sadly had to return my purchase.
other I wore this for a few hours, and while it i got compliments i ended up needing to return it after the seams opened up over the shoulder blades. the fabric is so fine that during the normal goings-about of my day it gave way. and no, i didn't buy too small, and the fabric didn't pull while i was driving or reaching for anything.
other Easy to wear, get lots of compliments when i wear it. can be dressed up or down
other Picked this darling vest in a medium. i have been eyeing for sometime but really did not want to pay full price, after checking other manufactures i came back to this vest at retailer. as the other reviewers mentioned, the softness, spec of colors which enables you to wear the vest with so many colors in bottoms and tops; the pockets, the belt, which i love as much as the pockets, though the faux fur collar i do wish was removable. the faux fur will limit me in getting away with wearing this vest
other Love this vest! i am not a huge vest person, and was worried about finding something to go with this, but i have been able to match it to so many cute thing. the pattern and quality are great. it runs big. if you're between sizes definitely go for the smaller size.
other Love this shirt, great fabric and fit. trying to wait for a sale to buy several others in additional colors.
other I tried on this dress in the store and absolutely fell in love! i'm a bigger gal who is busty and have wider hips. this dress made me look and feel slimmer, and is light to wear. the dress is a perfect length too. i'm 5'1other and this dress hits me right at the ankles. if your looking for a long dress to wear that can be either formal or casual, this one is perfect!
3 This item states you should wash in cold water and tumble dry low heat. it shrunk after first wash in cold water and i didn&#39;t even use the dryer. do not wash. real bummer..
other I was trying on the cream knit turtleneck midi dress in the store, and wanted the shearling vest shown with it to work for me. the dress is sleeveless, very good looking on, but the vest on me was too much, looked like i was being swallowed by a huge shearling taco. i wanted and needed something to stay warm in without the bulk of a full coat. the stylist brought me this jacket, and it was just the thing for me. its classic and modern, warm without bulk, and the two tone complimented the dress a
other I love this top. it's very comfortable looks great and the quality is very good. i've had many compliments on it.
other I normally wear a large but this had no give through the bust! beware big chested girls!!!
other I love the lacy details on the skirt. this dress is perfectly simple, yet can be dressed up too. as the evenings get cooler, it pairs up nicely with a cropped denim jacket or a cardigan.
other Runs a bit tight around upper arms. love the collar.
other I know it's a bit of a moot point since the chemise has sold out - but on the off chance any come back in stock, or if you see one at your local store - i urge you to try it on! the fabric is incredible. so luxurious. it fits me amazingly. i have a hard time with the whole tight chemise/slip/nightie category of clothing, as i'm fairly skinny, but still curvy, and while i love my curves, i do have a muffin top that can get real awkward when you're trying to look sexy. this, however, is a godsend.
other Nice quality, can work as a jacket or sweater. i've worn with and without the tie. i didn't realize from the pictures but the sleeves bell out giving it an extra touch.
other I somehow overlooked this online and saw it in the store. i am a 10/1other or m/l. i tried on the medium and it was tight in the bust but fit great in the waist. i ended up ordering the large online. the large felt good but a tad big in the waist. it hit my true waist though and looked good. i then noticed the straps were agustable. i wonder if i tried the medium and loosened the straps if it would have worked. either way i love the dress, so pretty and flowy. i wasn't bothered by the fabric and did
other The material of this dress is really thick and substantial. very soft and it has good movement. the cut was not quire right for my body, unfortunately. but on the right person, this would be very nice. i think a lot of different body types would look great in this dress, depending on where the waist hits etc.
other I ordered an xxs petite and this hangs like a bag on me. i'm usually fine with the petite sizing, but this didn't work and i'm so bummed. the dress is soft, the blue color is gorgeous, but it fits like a bag. i wanted to love this, but sadly will have to return. i think someone with curves will love this dress. it is really beautiful quality, just does not fit a petite frame.
other I love the look of this sweater, but just bought and put on at home and noticed other pea sized holes in fabric, near arm holes, but not on seams. not sure if i bought this way and did not notice or if fabric is just incredibly delicate. will try to repair but scated this will not hold up... look it over carefully before you buy, they kind of look like moth holes...
other Love this top! love that it ia jersey knit which makes it comfortable. love the print which makes it stand out. love the design of a side bow. i did not have an issue with the banded hem, in fact i like how it makes the top more structured.
3 I was looking forward to receiving this dress. i am tired of all of the swing dresses - most of which are not flattering on my petite frame. i am also uncomfortable with dresses that fall much above the knee as i am somewhat older. the colors and fabric of this dress are beautiful. vibrant, but not too bright. when i got it on i was thrilled with the fit - until i looked at the back. there are pleats at the waist in back and there is way too much fabric. it looked like i had a bustle under the d
other This sweater is beautiful and stylish, but unfortunately it sheds a bit. considering the sale price, it's still worth it so i won't return it.
other Completely in love with this dress! i'm a huge fan of byron lars, and this one by far is my favorite. everything about this dress is perfect. it's very well made too. i usually wear a size 4, but kept the size 6 instead. the waist felt a bit too tight with the 4. btw: the belt is adjustable.
other This dress worked well on me (not too curvy). it's fitted and enhances curves in a nice way. the patterns looked nice, too.
other Cute design. details on shoulder make the tshirt more special but it runs large so that kind of takes away from the styling. got it on super sale, so i'll keep it. maybe a wash will shrink it a bit...
other I saw this sweater and just about died. i loved the accentuated shoulders and beautiful knit detail on the sleeves. lucky for me, retailer day started a couple of days after this sweater debuted, and i snagged it right away. i just got it and am in love. it fits true to size and the shoulders and sleeves are everything i hoped they would be. the neckline in very flattering as well. it is soft and the color is gorgeous. if there is a negative, it would be that it is a bit boxy in the torso, and doe
other Ditto what the first reviewer said, unfortunately. i was so looking forward to receiving this dress but the one received is not the one in the photos. the graphics are fantastic - still love the boats- but the top is not the same and they've added a fabric belt to the finished dress. the fit was perfect except for gapping under the arms (similar, i suspect, to what the first reviewer reported). i was also surprised by the fabric. based on the photos i was expecting something light and semi trans
other I tried this jacket on in store, both m & l. both seemed to pull a little at waist/pocket (notice the raised pleat on the closeup. i ordered xl on line. it fits better but still seems to fit like the other two when fastened. snaps seem to be misplaced. on the plus side, the style is cute and there is brown (taupe) mixed in with the grey which is more flattering to brownettes. there isn't much difference in sizing of all three. i am not sure whether this is a keeper. open, it is fine and casual;
3 I liked the concept of this vest, but when i tried it on, i felt like i was 9 years old again and wearing my brownies girl scout uniform. it was also very boxy and wide. it seemed to be well-made, though, and maybe would have worked if it were a different color.
other I love this top! the top has nice details and is not too sheer. it did have a smell at first but that's gone now.
3 This romper is cute. i won't deny that. however, the rayon fabric made me really feel like i was wearing pajamas. i was afraid it would wrinkle horribly. however, the real problem with this romper is how hard it is to get on and off your shoulders. i'm short, but have a little wider shoulders, so, perhaps that was the issue. it seems like another reviewer had the same problem. there are only two snaps from the waist up and nothing to open it further from the waist down, so, i had to do some cont
other Cute colored jeans.  ordered the sky color & when it arrived,  the color was a medium moss green color.  the color was beautiful but was expecting a light blue so sadly i returned them.
other I was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately it's going back because the knit is just too thin. i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but it's not. and because it's so light, the swing effect doesn't really come off. nothing special.
3 I wanted to love this top. i really did. the color is beautiful, the embroidery is well done, the fabric is soft, and it feels like it would be very comfortable in the summer heat. but the armholes are big and so the holes show my bra which is not good. i guess i could wear a bandeau or tank underneath, but the armholes just kind of ruined my love for this top. i think i will try again and order next size down.
other I sized up to an xl and although they have everything you want in a yoga/lounge pant, they just didn't thrill me enough to keep them. they're soft, warm and comfy but i didn't care for the bulk or fit of the foldover waistband. and they were too long so i returned. if you're built like the model, you'll love these.
other Very disappointed that i ordered this dress and a large was too big. returned and asked for an exchange to a size medium, it was apparently not available in the medium, i was charged a 5.9other fee for return shopping. so i immediately went to website, medium available and i had to pay another 12.9other for shipping. seems a bit unreasonable, but really liked the dress.
other Lately retailer tees have been misses for me but i was intrigued by the reviewers comments about the shaping of the tee to enhance the illusion of a waistline. that drew me in because i have a short waist and some shaped tees just cling there and emphasize rolls more than my waist. but not this one. it is more fitted along the back waist and looser in the front. i generally order size large in tees as i did with this one. i don't think the fit is too big because it's cut not to cling anywhere. i h
other This is a very pretty sweater and the neutral color works well with everything. the detail in the back makes it unique. it runs large though, so size down. the sleeves by the cuffs do tend to stretch out easily, but it washes well, so it's not a big issue..
other I love this shirt. i actually bought two in black (my "uniform"), then decided to order one in white as well. however, the white shirt fit differently than the two black ones! it was significantly shorter; over 2' shorter! while the black tee is the perfect length, the shorter white version wasn't flattering on me and kind of flared out around my waist...not the best look. that being said, i know the black shirt will be in heavy rotation for a while, and the people at retailer were very und
other I'm a sucker for beaded detailing, so i couldn't resist this blouse. it's so beautiful and fun! i can't wait to wear it!
other I am 5.6", 138 pounds. i purchased this in a size small. it is flowy and not too short. it has a comfortable, but still feminine and beautiful fit. one of my favorite new blouses...the red print is gorgeous
other Give me a dress with pockets any day! i loved how i can wear this fall - spring. so cute. so comfortable. can dress it up or down. have other events that i'm going to wear it too!
3 The concept of this top is edgy for a sweatshirt fabric. i think it works better on a thin frame instead of my curvy frame. although i appreciate the design, it did not work for me.
other Beautiful blouse that can be dressed up or dressed down. online shows as purple, but the black mortif is be true black background with pretty floral colors. i rarely wear floral design, but this blouse make it work. the material is such a soft rayon material. love, love, love.
other I'm 5'other and a tad busty and this sweater i found to be most flattering. i saw it i. the store on was drawn to it. i love the shimmer but perhaps that's because the holiday feel is already in the air in nyc. the m fit great in both length pans width. it looked great with my straight black jeans and boots. i felt it made me look thin. thankful i bought it on a discount day! it's a fabulous sweater.
other Really like the quality, color, and overall design of these jeans. they ran a little long on me, but i just cut off an inch from the bottom and they fit perfectly with some tall booties. i didn't need to get them altered because the design of them is that they are cut at the bottom and are a little frayed. so, glad that was the case given the price tag on them. i am 5'7", 128 lbs and wear a size 28 which fit perfectly except for the length which was easily fixed. definitely recommend these jeans
other Whatever happened to sizing! pretty print and color but has enough fabric for other tops. it is also unlined which is not a huge issue. i wore it with a cami. the arms weren't too gaping for me, thankfully. i tried to make it work with a wide belt but i will have to get it tucked on the sides. i am 140 lbs and got the small. should have gone other or even other sizes smaller.
other This sweater is very nicely made...i got a lot of compliments the first time i wore it. it's a light sweater and looks great with jeans! love it
other This skirt is a show piece! the design is beautiful and the fit is flattering for different body types. i got my usual size, even though i have a smaller waist and larger hips and thighs. the skirt looks cute with the split-back buttondown by cloth and stone. you will not regret buying this piece!
other The material is a medium weight jersey knit that is slightly thicker so it provides enough coverage and support to be flattering without being bulky. i think this dress is true-to-size, or maybe runs a little bit big, but only by a little bit. i bought a medium and am a size 8 in tops and 10 in pants. the dress hugs nicely on the upper body (arms, chest, ribs) and flares just a little bit on the hips/tummy/butt area. it is forgiving of little bumps or lumps. the scoop neckline is a bit lower tha
other Cute tunic.  fits on the fitted side but i love it with a vest layered over. nice material.
other I bought this online. this looked like a sweater that was accidentally shrunk in the dryer, when i received it.i will be returning this.
other This dress fits like a dream and looks gorgeous on. i'm sure it will be a go to for many occasions.
other I bought these to go with the boiled wool jacket that is also currently on sale. i have several pairs of charlie trousers, and i really like the brand. these are in a thicker "winter fabric" and i understand why the other reviews found them itchy. i don't find that bothersome, but the texture is a bit different. the quality is typical for charlies. the color stripe is a metallic bronze, but could look pink in the right light. the fabric is noticeably stretchy--i think without that stretch, these
other This top/jacket is less red than it appears in the pictures - more of a wine color (as it is labeled) but it is pretty and the gold details are nice.
other I got this in blush pink and the details are very pretty. the dress is wide, might have a tailor bring it in on the sides, but its very comfortable and i like that it covers my arms a bit, but still keeps you cool.
other This is a beautiful sweater, warm, looks great with jeans as well as more formal work clothes. the neckline gives it a stylish boho twist beyond the traditional. i love the color, and it can function almost like a neutral, complimenting almost any other hues. highly recommended!
other I wanted to love this sweater. the lavender color and design with the pleated back was beautiful. however when i put it on, it added at least 20 pounds to my frame. unfortunately it's going back since the cut just doesn't work on my frame.
other I ordered a size xl in the mango. the fit on me matches the model for the most part so i think it's true-to-size. it looks like it's intended to have a loose, flowier fit throughout the dress. the only confusing part to me is the model is listed as being 5' 9" and i'm under 5' 6" yet the length is the same. it fits me at knee-length too. i thought it would hit a little longer based on the model's info for the photos and getting the regular sizing. the one thing i wish was different is to have it
other My daughter bought this sweater in xs in white and i tried it on. it was a little too tight but long enough to wear with leggings so i ordered the red in a s. it just covers my butt in the back - not nearly as long as my daughter's. i still love the sweater and will wear it with jeans but it is way too short to wear with leggings. i don't understand how there can be such a difference in the same sweater - a size larger and at least other inches shorter! if not for that, i would have rated it a 5.
other Surprisingly versatile and figure flattering without being too clingy and revealing like so many "bandage" dresses. the navy color softens the stripes. great piece for travel as it is light and does not wrinkle. i am 5'7" and 12other lbs. with a smaller chest and curvy hips. the small fits perfectly.
other This is truly the best black dress...you can wear to sooo many things. a long time keeper for the closet. i felt it ran a little bit big...i am normally an 8-10...i bought both sizes (8 and 10)...kept the 8...but felt i could even get away with a 6...but didn't want to pay shipping again for another size. i am 5'7" and 155lbs. it is truly a flattering dress for any figure.
other The material is more like a great tee for the sleeves and the back, so it is so comfortable. i agree with the previous review, i am not thrilled about the hook and eye, but it still looks cute with a tank under it. i bought it in black and i am ordering it as well in white. it looks great with skinny jeans or pants.
other I feel really cool wearing this skirt :-) a nice alternative to the jeans that are my standard uniform. loooks great with short boots. i'm wearing it as i write this review--and was wearing it all day. awesome skirt!
3 The smallest size, xs, was big on me, i was overwhelmed by the sweater. it is a bit of swing shape, doesn't hug the body. sleeves are interesting though, but not flattering on a petite frame. color is a pretty green, made me think of wintergreens. fabric may be itchy to some. just ok for me.for reference xs bog on 11other lbs, 30dd, 26.other in waist.
other This skirt is super cute and a great easy skirt to wear with basically anything. but what is truly remarkable is the softness off its fabric. i found it in the store and wasn't sure i needed it but it felt so good i could not put it down!
3 I was so excited to receive this shirt and so disappointed when i tried it on. it's a lot fuller than it looks in this picture or maybe it's because i ordered a large? i'm 5'8", 180lbs, 36d bra size and can fit into a large at retailer just fine but it made me look huge! not flattering at all and it was so full that it looked like a short dress!
other I bought this in the neutral motif, and it's exactly as it appears online except a bit more vivid in real life. the colors are ivory with dusty pink and blue/gray puffs of color. the fabric is incredibly soft. i usually wear a small in tops but went up to a medium and i'm glad i did. if you like things really fitted, i guess you could order your normal size, but since i wanted this to have some room for long sleeves underneath, i went with the medium. this zip-hoodie is great quality and it look
other I have these shirts in the blue and green and they were great. i'm 5'4" c chest and athletic build - the small shirts fit pretty good and i love the fabric so i kept them. i really wanted these dresses to work but the cut was different even between the gray and burgundy. there was tons of room in the chest, but it was tight in the shoulders. i really wanted to love this, but there's just too many cut issues. it is a good length for work though.
other I bough this dress in blue and i cannot tell you the compliments and the looks i get on the street! no kidding! this is a beautiful dress which has a very feminine/romantic quality to it. i bought size other and it sits perfectly on my waist i completely fell in love with that dress and especially with the lace work and the design. this is a classic piece, that is always going to be timeless in my opinion. no regret at all to have bought it!
3 I ordered the yellow color way expecting it to be a mustard color. it seemed to have a greenish tint to it and didn't look right on me. also the pockets didn't lay right so the flower didn't look right.
other I love this sweater. i didn't buy it the first time when i tried it at the store because the buttoned look created a bulk on one side and i thought that this was very weird. it might have been what i was wearing underneath that day or that particular sweater. but then at 40% off i decided to give it another try and i'm happy that i did. i bought the navy and i love the feel of the material. sizing down makes all the difference, too. i wasn't fan of the attached sleeves at first as they are made
other Adorable, true to size and just as pictured. there is no hook and eye clasp as stated but still cute. light weight and will be perfect over dresses and summer tanks. wish there were additional colors. i love the white though.
other This is my favorite find of the fall. i got the mustard color and it is wonderful.   very soft, nice shape, unique design. i am usually between a medium and large in tops, but i found that the medium was a little too short for my liking.  (i am  other ft 8 in tall).  even sizing up, it's far too short for me to wear as a dress as some others had mentioned, but looks great with jeans and boots. the large is perfect!!
other Purchased in white. very pretty top. i thought it would be more lace - but non the less, it is lovely.
other I love these pants. i have them in navy and carbon. the navy color seems to run bigger than the carbon. they are very loose like a boyfriend pant in navy. they loosen up as the day goes on as well. super comfy and great for running errands and taking my little one to the park. i can look cute and feel comfy and i can give my yoga pants a break.
other I find it very difficult to find office friendly yet unique designs and feel this one fits the bill and also has the ability to be dressed up for the evening. i am "curvy on bottom" so i sized up from my normal retailer other to a 6 and surprisingly the dress fit my hips just fine. i'm 5'8" 140 about 36-27-36 if it helps as i know it's hard to determine sometimes if this style will fit a more curvy figure...my advice is to go up a size if you are. the fabric i found true to the photo and the emerald i
other These socks are soft and comfortable, and they are very short so they'll be good with booties. i couldn't tell from the pictures but the pale gray dots are surrounded by a border of subtle silver thread. they're adorable!
other I love a good gaucho/ culotte. these are very comfortable and fit is tts (i'm 5'9" 14other and wear a 29). they are ironed with a line down the front, which i don't like, as it's always hard for me to keep the ironing straight. the pants have a little bit of stretch to them which is nice. since they're linen, they will require frequent ironing (which, i hate to do in the summer).
other I wanted this top to work so bad. unfortunately the way the bust of the top is designed it isn't flattering if you aren't flat chested. it squishes on side of your chest and leaves the other side alone. i'm a b cup and had this problem so if you are a b or larger, i don't recommend. however, if you are smaller busted, this piece would be worth the purchase.
other They are very comfortable and have kept their shape after a couple of wearings. the pants can be used for informal or on the dressier side. the spandex in them is contributes to the comfort.
other I read all the reviews and they were very helpful the waist does run small so i sized up which was perfect. i love how this skirt is lightweight and swingy. i cant get enough comfortable denim skirts. so size up and you will love this, i am a slightly hippy girl and the skirt did not make me look big at all.
other I should have read the reviews first before ordering this top/!. ***buyers beware**: you will not get the same top delivered to you, as is shown in this picture. the top i got delivered does not have the little straps at all, and while there is a bow in the back, the back sides do not come together the same to form the bow. i hate to write a bad review, but come on retailer! i'd never expect this from you. it looks like any other peplum white top, not something special like the picture is o
other The dress is lovely. my only knock on it is i didn't really feel like the top and the skirt matched in terms of level of dress. i guess the top just wasn't "fancy" enough for me. but it is a very beautiful skirt. i wish it was in a tea length. the fit was spot on.
other I wasn't sure what size to get in this and how it would fit since there weren't any reviews but i ordered it in a size 10 and it fits really well. i usually get dresses in a size 8 but those flow a bit more and this on my waist (am curvy on bottom) i needed to get the 10, it sits well on my waist and i don't have to hike it up. the material is chino like so it does get a bit wrinkled but it has a nice weight and the pleats give it a pretty flow not too boxy making my hips look bigger. it has bel
other The fabric is a nice weight knit and the top generally well made. unfortunately, the fit was enormous. i've an athletic build w/ big boobs & normally wear l in retailer tops.
other I absolutely love these shorts! they are the perfect length, too. i have been looking for shorts this length and rise height for years. it's hard to find shorts that aren't super short yet aren't bermuda and are still flattering. i especially recommend these for those that miss wearing shorts because of insecurities with their thighs/mid-section.rolls are not sewn on both ends, so you'll have to re-roll each wash.wish you carried these basics at all times.
other There's something special about this tank that makes it uber-flattering. the fabric is perfect, the colors (green and fuchsia) are spot-on gorgeous and brightening, and the cut (length, wide straps, and scooped neckline) make this the perfect staple. it flattered my figure, skin color, and really hid my flaws. i wish i could get away with wearing this every day...
other The skirt really is beautiful - the blue and coral are brighter in person than in the picture above. it's a nice lightweight material that feels quality, but has too much stretchy spandex in it for my tastes. i had the same problem as others - the skirt runs very small. i am usually a size 6, and while i could zip the 6 up, the skirt had those puckers that come from being a size too small.
other This beautiful blue sweater was exactly what i wanted!
other Good design, comfortable fit. however, sizing is way off. i am a 34c and the small fits with minimal support. agree with the previous review. not sure it is a keeper.
other I read all the previous reviews and wasn't sure what to think. when i saw it on sale at my local retailer store, i decided that, despite the thin fabric, it was worth getting. i love the quote spoken by audrey hepburn in the movie "sabrina" and knew i just needed to add a cami underneath. i bought it two days ago and wore it yesterday with a short sleeved open sweater, so the quote showed. i got two compliments on it within a short time! for reference, i am 5'9" and 150 lbs. i bought a large and i
other First of all, i'm not a "navy" person at all. i much prefer black or other bright colors. i received an e'mail showing this trench last saturday and i pulled it up online and noticed how darling it looked. i didn't order it, but i went back the following day to check it out again. it was nowhere on the website. then a few days ago, back it popped up online again. i noticed it wasn't in my local store so i thought i'd go in and look this weekend. i just had to see it. i actually made it to the st
other This sweater does have a matching tie belt. it is detached, no belt loops. i'm guessing the previous reviewer accidentally threw it away with packing material. i loved this sweater on line. i could not bring myself to order it at full price. with tax it would have cost over $200, seemed too pricey for a sweater. when it was marked down to $99 with free shipping i couldn't hit buy fast enough. i was afraid it would sell out before i got through check out. my disappointment was the color. it is fa
3 Skirt was too big in the wiast and too much fabric. was not flattering, and generally not cute enough to warrent spending 50$ to get it tailored. usual size, oop felt atleast other sizes too large. the pattern on the skirt, and the nuetral color is very nice. if you can find one that fits, would be a nice 3 season skirt!
other I was so happy to see this dress at one of my local retailer stores since i've had this in my basket since i first saw it, i tried it on in my usual size and it runs true to size in all areas. the length is as shown int he picture, i am 5'4" and it hit me right above the knee. i am short waisted and the dress fit perfect, sat right above my waist and then lay just as shown. not too much material to make you look fuller in the hips, and also not too young looking. i am planning to wear it to
other This dress is absolutely fantastic. beautiful, high-quality, and fits like a glove. even better than i could have imagined.
other Thrilled this statement piece is back. i get so many compliments on this and it's practical as well for our cold minnesota winters. highly recommend!
other Perfect for the summer weddings that i am attending. i am 5-1, 119#, 32dd and usually a sp. i tried on a regular s and xs in the store, and the s was huge. i ended up ordering the regular xs instead of the petite xs when the 20% off sale hit because i liked the extra length. great bra coverage...it is not too long at the armholes, or too low in the back. i will take it up a bit in the top seams just so it doesn't have quite so much decolletage, but it is wearable as is. this is much more of a ro
other I ordered this blouse because it was such a good price on sale but should have paid closer attention to the reviews. the slits on the sleeves are much more noticeable than in the photo and the blouse just didn't work for me. something about it reminded me of seinfeld's pirate shirt. i appreciate retailer's return policy. i took it back to the store and got an immediate refund on my cc.
other This suit is great for curvy and slightly flawed figures. the vintage look delivers full coverage that still looks sexy. not your mother's one-piece.
other I ordered this dress on a whim because of the lush colors and the sale price. to my amazement, it has become one of my go-to dresses. it is far more handsome and flattering in person. i ordered a m for my 5'9" and 36c frame and the fit is perfect. contrary to how the back of the dress is shown on the model, the back is not straight, but flows whimsically thereby adding to its famine appeal. at this price, it's a no-brainier purchase.
other I went ahead and ordered a size up based on previous reviews, but i should have ordered my own size, as they're a bit loose around the waist. the pants are adorable and the pinstripes very flattering, so i definitely recommend them!
other I absolutely love this top! cute and feminine without being over the top. i basically love everything meadow rue puts out there...and this was no exception.
other These are nice dusty rose pants. they have a great textured design on them. they will look nice with a plain white tee or chambray shirt for brunch! i will say they are not soft like sweatpants, definitely feel like a poly-blend but the look makes up for it. the material is a little on the thin side and they are not lined....but not see-through either.
3 I had been eyeing this top for weeks. it's look so beautiful on the model, however, not great on me. material is fab. the tee is way shorter than it appears online and there is too much flutter material.
other A really great basic that can be styled a number of ways. i bought it in tan and white and received many compliments on it. the slightly off the shoulder look is really flattering and perfect for a spring or summer look.
other I ordered an xxs and it is extremely short in length. another customer had a similar review, but i still took a chance that it would fit well. the sides of the shirt have slits, and because the shirt is too short, it shows the skin on my hips. the rest of the shirt fit fairly well, but i'll still need to return this top.
other I ordered one of the xl in the red version. the fit is true to size. it matches the model's photos. the color is much prettier in person. it looks washed-out on my computer. but, in person, it's a nice light red. the quality of the material is okay. not as good as with the floral version of this style (florascura tank). the layers are flattering for my pear-shape. it definitely needs a tank underneath though. not worth full-price in my opinion but worth getting on sale.
3 I love how different this dress is in terms of the design. it catches light beautifully. the short, biased hem makes the dress fun and flirty. but, this dress is completely sheer. there is no lining which is very disappointing. i do have a short, nude slip that makes this dress work for me. you will need a slip, for sure! unless you are rhianna. the sizing runs a little large, i probably could size down given the loose cut but overall the proportions are flattering showing off my legs. i will re
other I was first attracted to this tunic by the beautiful, bright colors; tried it on, and it was becoming, comfortable, and perfect for my laid-back lifestyle. i just bought it a week ago, have worn it three times already. i bought the blue.
other I know you've heard it before, but this dress is so much more beautiful in person! i'm petite, usually size other but busty, so i tried the other and the 6 in the store. the other fit perfectly except it was a bit snug at the bust so the the slit pulled open, revealing a bit more cleavage than i wanted. the 6 fit perfectly through the bust, and although it was a bit loose through the body, the cut was still very flattering. i also tried the 6p, which fit but i preferred the longer length of the regular 6.
other I bought the blue & white one and it is so very comfortable! it will look with my blue jeans and in the summer with my white leggings! great quality at a good price.
other I bought these pants expecting to lounge around the house in them. but once i tried them on, they were so figure flattering that i wore them to an outdoor dinner party (paired with a black tank top, silver accessories, and wedges) and got compliments galore. i still wear them to lounge in (they are super comfy) but they are also my emergency "oh we're going out tonight, honey?" pants. the only downside is that they need ironing when you pop them out of the wash (unless you are using them to loun
other This top is full of amazing details. the photos really don't do it justice. it is very flowy and does run large but is so pretty and soft and in beautiful shades of blue. i bought a small and it is fairly long in back on my 5'5" frame but because of the detailing...it just works.
other I am not a one-piece body type. this is the best best best romper i have ever tried on!! i have a large bottom and this is so forgiving due to the 1)perfect length of shorts 2) drapey fabric (not clingy) 3) asymmetrical cut of the top. highly recommend!
other Tried this twice in yellow because for the price it seems like it would be such a useful piece, but the quality is below average for an retailer dress. it's just a shapeless, thin, beach cover-up that i could've picked up anywhere. the yellow color is so cute though. if you're looking for a light, breezy, go-to-the-beach dress that you can shove in a bag with your towel, this might be good for you, but it's too thin for just about anything else.
other This skirt is figure flattering and stylish, while still being work appropriate. i like the length as well.
other I saw this dress and fell in love right away! this is right up my alley, super comfy, perfect fit and love the stud detail. can't wait to wear!
other I wear jeans so much, therefore i love to a variety in color. these jeans are so comfortable. they are like wearing sweat pants, but they truly keep their shape so well. i bought the red, which is a year around red, kind of a bright apple red. i will definitely be buying another pair of these ag jeans.
other This dress is gorgeous in person. it is so much softer than it appears the photo and the fabric moves well. what you can't see from the picture is that the bodice sort of overhangs the skirt by an inch or so which is really nice for accentuating a small waist and separates the top from the bottom in a cool way. i am 5'6" 13other lbs and curvy. 36-26-39 for reference. i ordered the other and it is loose although still flattering thanks to the forgiving cut. wish i had gotten a other but now they are sold
other I bought these on sale and love, love them! they are comfortable and super cute with the print detail on the calves and around the waist. i am waiting to receive the matching hoodie. don't know it i will wear them together since i don't like to be too "matchy". i have worn the leggings with a long black tunic top and grey slip on sneakers. very happy with this purchase!
other Would buy this again in a heartbeat. so comfortable and fit is great. color will look good with jeans or a dress. bought it for a cruise in the spring and it is perfect!
other I love this top. i also have it in blue! i wish it came in more colors/ prints! i would definitely buy it!
other I love this turtleneck so much!! got it in black. looks great with skirts and under sweaters. love that you can wear the collar two ways. drapes and clings perfectly. the silver snaps along collar are such a nice detail. details like this is what makes retailer pieces so unique. love it! i am usually an xs or small in tops. 34b bra size. i ended up with the xs.
3 Cute dress to throw on and go. fits pretty true to size except for the slip underneath. it's a little tight and i felt to short for the dress. i ended up wearing a full slip i had under it and that work great!
other The fabric, colors and concept are fabulous but the pleating is overdone is it looks huge not swingy!i am 5' 9" and 135lbs. and even an x-small was too billowy to be cute. too bad- it's otherwise so great!
other This top is so pretty and feminine. i love how the design and quality of this top.
other Love the material (more natural fiber than synthetic), the pattern, and the colors. also, it is cozy! the one con is that it is really big and crazy-long. so long, that it may be a show-stopper. on the fence about that.
3 The design of this dress is darling and so unique, and it's very well made. but i agree it's very boxy and overwhelming for a petite frame. i'm 5'3" and ordered the 2, and it was like wearing a hospital gown. if a petite were available i'd have tried that, but this one's going back. shame, too, because it's adorable. the gap in the neckline could easily be stitched or sewn shut, but that's an inconvenience when this dress is already priced so high.
3 Bought it on sale and i am keeping it. it is well made an the material seems to be of good quality. however, i believe this would be more flattering on someone less curvy - less hips, smaller bust - as it makes me look slightly pregnant. still, i am keeping it to use on those days i just don't feel like dressing up for work. i bought a large (i'm a 36-38c), but i think i could've gotten away with a medium.
other This tee has the cutest details and the green is actually a beautiful, deeper green. the shirt has a great fit and looks so much more flattering on than the pictures show. (5'4" 109# got an xs, slightly loose, exactly how i like it.) the somewhat mottled/dye type color makes it a casual piece for me; great with jeans. nice fabric, thickness.
3 I bought the cream version online, as the blue was sold out. i was rather disappointed to see that the cream is just a glorified sweatshirt. there are no dots, it it just the heathered cream of any normal sweatshirt. i do, however, like the design and the fit of the sweatshirt. i am sad that is was not clear (in the photos or in the name) that the cream version was not dotted. i am still deciding if i will keep the shirt. i love the design and fit, but the plain boring sweatshirt was not what i
other Tops are a challenge for me. i am top heavy so i often have to size up to avoid pulling in the bust. this one is not over sized in the bust but i am able to open the laceing for a little more wiggle room but still not look like i am wearing a tent. fabric is wonderful. it is not too thin and not too thick.? it does pull up slightly in the wash. it requires a little ironing or a good steaming.
other I love white shirts and can never have enough in my closet. this one is gorgeous, and is way prettier in person than it looks on the model. it has a peplum bottom with sort of (but not quite)appliquã©d large polka dots all over. it is a pullover, so there are no buttons on the peplum. i normally wear xl in retailer tops unless they run very large. i tried on the large in the store and it fit but i knew if it shrank when i washed it i'd never be able to wear it again. i ordered the xl which came tod
other I love the style of this coat and the way it fits on the model. in reality, the cut is more straight. i was hoping for some darting and a slimmer silhouette. cinching the belt makes the coat bunch unattractively. if i sized down, i think it would look better but i'm concerned that my shoulders will not fit. the fabric is 60% poly/40% wool and a bit itchy where it's not lined. the lining is a jersey poly blend. the belt has flimsy ugly string loops that cheapens look of the coat. other than the b
other These have an amazing fit! i have them in three colors. they are not too low rise, they are not too high. they are the perfect length. the only thing i do not like is the rolled cuff is not stitched and comes down easily if you do not iron down.
other Adorable skirt. thought the a-line and length were great. 5'other and 135lbs. went up a size and it fit perfect. can dress it up or down. really happy with this wardrobe staple.  not too stiff denim of so moves well and feels comfortable.
3 I adored this suit - the style, the colors, the thick quality of the fabric...but unfortunately the bottom seams cut into my groin and backside so much, it was practically painful! i'm 5'7', 128 lbs, and usually wear a size small, but was advised to size up. even with the medium i tried on, everything fit well but the length, though i've never thought i had a long torso. sizing up to a large would make the bust way to large for my small b chest. was so sad to return this suit!
other I'm 5'1", <100 lbs. xs fits surprisingly well. the sleeves were rolled up when it arrived so i didn't noticed they were long. the wrinkled appearance looks fun and casual. the big drawback is that the interior seams poke and scratch my skin when i wore it over a halter top. even over a tee it was irritating in one spot. despite that, love it enough to keep.
other Love this skort. bought it in green in store and am now going to get it in black on line. fairly true to size maybe on the lightly larger side. soft, well made and comfortable! bought size 4, am 5'5" 110lbs
3 I agree with the other reviewers; this sweater was strangly shaped in the waist, in an unflattering way. the rest of it was beautiful though. looks too much like maternity, even in a petite xs, so it's going back.
other I love unstructured pull on dresses in the summer and this maeve is better than photo. i wear a medium and fit is spot on. i also purchased the earlier version of this dress, same style and maker, different pattern and have gotten a lot of wear out of it this past summer. i expected this dress to be identical, but it's even better, it's fully lined and is a slightly different and more substantial fabric.and did i mention pockets! i plan to wear it into the fall with a short cardi to dress it u
other I ordered this in size xl and it is a perfect top. the draping is very flattering to my shape. the material is soft and the flowers/colors are appropriate for work. it's the perfect length too. i love everything about the cut of this top. the pattern will vary on each since the flowers are staggered. i love the knot effect along the waist. great purchase. hope this style will continue to be used for other tops in other patterns/colors for spring/summer timeframe. these are a little too dark/heav
other The sweater looked different on each model so i wasn't sure what to expect. luckily, it fitted me similar to the one i was hoping it would, the cream sweater model. i'm 5'6" and got a size small. i like that it hangs just past my hips and the long sleeves. also, the v-neck isn't too low so i don't have to wear a camisole.it's very cozy and doesn't itch.
other Very cute and comfy dress. i'm 5'6" and 117 pounds and the xs worked great. it is meant to fit big and comfy so don't expect a tailored dress. looks great with tights and boots and i love that you can turn it around to make it a cardigan!
other I am so happy with this dress. i bought my usual size 2, and it was a perfect fit. this dress is gorgeous. it has some stretch, which is a plus. i am 5'other ", and it was not too long on me at all. i am so thrilled with my purchase.
other Awesome fabric, wonderfully flattering cut. love the blue and green colors.
other This sweater is absolutely adorable! i was worried about the layers looking too frumpy but they were not - i normally wear a size medlum (8), but i sized down on this sweater on a gut feeling and bought a small --i didn't want it to be too loose or billowy, and it fits perfectly. will be so cute with jeans but also with skirts for work! you will be so happy you bought this one.
other I tried this one without a bra, and t was fine... a little droopy but i could go without.the things that bothered me: the pattern wasn't even on both sides, so where the seem is on the legs by the wait, didn't match... some people may not be annoyed by that, but hard for me not to look at.also, the length on the model is just below the knee. i usually order petite, but tried on regular size in the store... i liked it like that, the hem went to below the big part of my calf, so it 3was flatte
3 I really wanted to love this suit, but it honestly looked really matronly in person.
other Love the fit....not so tight you can wear a short top with these, but not slouchy either. color goes with everything. for wrinkles, i hung them and sprayed with water...wrinkles gone. bought other pair for traveling.
other I ordered the in the emerald green and it was sent to me with a dime size hole in the sleeve. i am very disappointed, because i love the sweater. by the time it arrived, it was sold out in my size. now, i cannot exchange it for one that is not damaged. if the sweater was not damaged, i would recommend this product.
other I love this sweater coat. i just put on a pair of leggings and boots and i'm good to go. it's warm and flattering and comfortable and i can wear it anywhere, it works at the office, out to eat, shopping or even just hanging around.fit: some of the other comments mention the small waist. this is a fitted sweater, not a roomy piece for layering over other pieces. i like the fit because i get the warmth of a big sweater without the bulk. the fit is similar to dresses that i have purchased at anth
other This is a perfect sweater. it's comfortable, practical and lends an elegant hand to a pair of jeans. it also hides your bits and stays flattering. i have worn it a lot because it makes life so easy and i have not had any issues yet with lace tearing.tts. 5'7" 127 lbs 34b wearing this in size small
other Perfect trans top.  skinnies or boyfriend and booties.  love the mixed prints
other This reminded me of big bird in person and just adds volume to your body. i'm thin and usually wear a size 0, so i'm not sure who this may look good on.
other I love this top! was not immediately in love with it when i saw it on line but when i saw it in store the other day and got to try it on i fell in love!! the colors at a little deeper in person, which i loved! it is a traditional soft flannel top! it is fitted and flattering! a must have for fall/winter!!
3 I really liked this cardigan when i saw it today. the cut and detail in the back is slimming and very flattering. i love the idea of the safety pin closure, and i really like how the model wears it in this photo-open with the pin on the side. when i saw this in-store, it was closed in the front with the pin, which i also like. i thought for sure the cardigan was also pinned in back when i saw it in the model, so it looked fantastic. however, when i tried it on myself, it wasn't quite the same.
other This shirt is not a good look for a gal with hips. the fit at the top is tight (i ordered a small) but there is so much material at the bottom and if you are a little taller (i am 5'7), it hits at a place that is not flattering. i was hoping for something that hung straight down and would be good with leggings. this is not it...also the material is a little stiffer then i was expecting.
other I saw this suit in the store and was immediately drawn to it. i did not think it was gonna work because i have boobs (real ones) and i was not sure it would provide enough support. it is the cutest suit ever. have enough support to get away with it but definitely couldn't go for a jog. ha. it will also look great with white jeans and double as a bodysuit.
other Nice feminine pattern with a thick fabric. it's great having pockets! the white is ivory. i'm a size 4, and the small fits nicely. it would be nice, if the pant length was a little longer. i have a 31" inseam, and they end up being a couple of inches above my ankle, but that's just my preference. overall, very happy with this purchase.
other I ordered these in a size small on sale, thinking that because of the material, they might not fit. they are actually very cute, and fit in the waist/legs, but in the crotch area, as another reviewer mentioned, they could fit a little better. they look fine with a longer top so i decided to keep them.
other I saw this in the store and fell in love with it, i didn't buy it at first but i couldn't stop thinking about how comfortable it was so i went back and purchased it, its soft and very comfortable, im glad i went back for it.
other I love this tee, i own it and wear it nearly every other day in black and purple solids and ordered other of the prints. wish that the purple/gray floral print would restock since it sold out before i could purchase it. only possible negative is that i am careful not to tumble dry it due to other reviews of its vulnerability to tears or holes. so i hang it up to dry after machine washing. i read that it runs a bit large so i ordered and am thrilled with my medium.
other I love these shorts!!!! i usually have a really hard time finding shorts that fit my pear-shape, but these are great. i bought in a few different colors and i definitely will get a lot of use out of them this summer!
other I love the look and design of these pants. i'm 5'1, 110lbs and i ordered a 25p and still had to get them hemmed to even fit like pants. on the model, these look cropped but mine were even too long to be pants when i got them. i love the pant but if you are a petite, be ready to need alterations to the length!!
other Yep, i used to have a nice body, but now have the dreaded menopause stomach... and some excess baggage. this dress was very flattering. wore it today, easter sunday and had literally a dozen people seek me out to tell me how great the dress was or how nice i looked. it is a bright pink, think pepto bismol! heavy brocade type fabric plus a great cut = hiding my stomach and rear!! plus the lower neckline emphasized my nicer areas! very pleased to find a dress for us older women to look fresh and f
other I ordered this in xs and s. they both fit very well and i couldn't tell much difference between the two. i kept the s as it seemed to have a little more length on it. i am 5'4" about 120#. i wish this were offered in lots of different solids and more patterns (the taupe and white stripe...hint hint hint) too. it's just perfect. i am in my mid 40s and have young kids so it's great for my life right now! comfortable too!
other I love this shirt so much that i bought it in both colors. i purchased the xs regular which fit perfectly. the material is incredibly soft yet thick enough that i know it has some durability. the neckline is very flattering and comes up higher than most tees but not so high that it feels constricting. i also love that it is slightly tapered and comes in towards your waist at the sides and is slightly longer in the back. it's an absolute staple in my wardrobe now.
other Tried this dress on at my local retailer and just fell in love with it. it is a sleek, almost '90's style design that is so comfortable and flattering at the same time. and it has pockets! i will be wearing it all summer with flats or sneakers.
other I love how boho, colorful and comfy this dress is. sometimes you just want to wear your comfiest bra and not worry about a dress that doesn't cover the straps. they were out of the petite small so i went with the small. i am 5' 12other lbs, and it fits perfectly, just more of a midi length. no problemo!
other This is a lovely sweater but i wished i had ordered the xs (only the small was left).
other I wasn't sure how this top would look on me but i just love it! i am 5'3", 11other lbs and i ordered the petite small. i may even been able to get away with petite xs. i did not find this top too full, long or tentlike at all. i have a bust as well and it looks very flattering on me. i wore it with denim shorts and it will look great with skinny jeans. i would also wear it on the beach as a cover up. very versatile. i love the color and pattern on the top and really love the black lace on the bottom
other Well made embroidery, held up well in the wash. love the unique green color pattern! comfortable.  got a size 4(115#, 5'2", 34b).
3 Embroidered tulips look like they were plucked when comparing the dresses in the product photos. took a chance any way, came out disappointed because i couldn't zip up the bodice. i hate side zips and when you pair a cheap zipper with delicate material, recipe for disaster! i am top and back heavy so though i lost weight and went down a cup size, my back is too wide for the 12p. for reference i'm 135# 36d 38/28/35.
3 I  absolutely fell in love with the stress when i sought in the store. the fabric and drape of the fabric is amazing! however, it runs extremely small. i normally wear a medium and can sometimes even wear a small and dresses. i tried on the medium and the large and i could not even get them zipped all the way.  i'm so disappointed, as this is a gorgeous dress.  definitely size up at least one, maybe two sizes.
other I love the way this t-shirt fits. the horseshoe opening in front is deep enough to add interest, but not too revealing. will look great with layered, dainty necklaces. the sleeves are nice and long - and i have long arms. the length of the shirt itself could be an inch or two longer, but overall the design is nice. not too tight, not too loose. i'm 5' 5" and 12other lbs - 34c and the small fits me well. fabric is medium weight - could be a little thicker. the brick color is nice and works great with
other Love this shirt. great shape and lightweight material for hot houston weather. washes up nice but does need some ironing.
other I will find myself reaching for this top time and time again
other This top looks even better in person! the fit is very flattering and the fabric is comfortable. i highly recommend it!
other This is a beautiful coat and the fit and weight are perfect. my only hesitation in giving it other stars is that the lapel's don't lay perfectly flat. i read some complaints about the placement of the button but it doesn't bother me. otherwise it's a gem and i'm going to keep it.
other I am so glad i tried this dress on. it is so chic and beautiful! perfect for an evening out or during the day. i can't believe the price!
other I absolutely love this top. it can be worn with shorts or jeans, dressed up or down. it fits perfectly, i am broad on top so i ordered a large. i bought it in white..i wish they had more colors. love it.
other I love this top--the fabric, the color, they way it hangs. i'm glad i tried it on in the store though because the v on the small went waaay too low, so i sized down to an xs and it was perfect. it basically fit the same as the small but with a higher v so my bra wouldn't show.
other I love designs that are flowy/drapey in the front, so this hits the mark when tied in the back. has lots of visual interest. but i agree with the other reviewers.. the slip is super small. dress fits true to size, if not a bit large but the slip is one full size smaller. and you must wear a slip. overall, i'm pleased with the look.
other I decided to go shopping at my local co store and as soon as i walked in, i saw this skirt but it was used  as a top with green cropped summery pants on a mannequin. one of the lovely salesgirls decided she liked it better that way after she tried it as a top herself.  i tried it as well and love it as a top! she was small framed and my height and told me she sized up for comfort and she was correct. if used with a strapless bra, your regular size ( mine is a small) will be uncomfortable. howeve
other This little jacket is so soft and perfectly lightweight. the color goes with everything! more money than i wanted to spend, but i am so glad i took a chance and ordered online. it is exactly what i was looking for!
other I love this skirt. the material is soft and beautiful. i love wearing it with black tights and boots. the skirt is quite a bit longer than how it appears on the model, however (unless the model is 10 ft tall!). i am 5'2" and if i place the skirt under my ribs, it reaches right above my knee. it works though and doesn't look bad. i would still recommend you buy this!
other Loved these in the store but the 00 was sold out everywhere and i noticed the fabric was very stretchy. i bought the 0 petite online and was worried about the length. they fit great. i'm 5'5" .
other I love this top it is easy to wear fun and very comfortable. i was thinking about it for weeks and kept coming back to it after i read a review about going up a size i decided to go for it and i am very happy i did!!! my new favorite!!!
other Love this piece! lots of versatility and the pattern is lovely. wear it alone or with leggings and boots.
other Beautiful, feminine, flowy dress. love the brass button detail at neckline and around waist-gives the otherwise delicate dress a pop of "edge". had to detach the slip to get it on, but glad it is included with the dress. i purchased the small and fits like a glove (5'8", 135lbs, 34d). can't wait to wear it!!
other This is a simplistic beauty. the colors are lovely and as pictured. i believe it is tts but if your small busted you could probably go down a size. i personally stayed with my small and i lke the flow of it. the flannel has a nice weight to it so you can wear this fall, winter and early spring if you live in a cooler climate.
other I'm glad i listened to my instincts once again regarding maeve maxidress. the stretchiness of this knit jersey fabric allows me to comfortably size down from my usual medium/large since the fabric relaxes so much as you wear it. i adore the color, pattern, slim profile and cut in arm holes. wearing this makes my short self feel statuesque and sofisticated.
other Love my new top! i wear it casually with skinny navy pants and dressed up with new wide leg winter white pants! it's funky style garnered lots of compliments. as a mother of two teens i love to dress cute and appropriate. it really pairs well with so much and the bold flower makes it stand out!
other I loved this dress. i am other ft tall and usually wear xs. this dress i would definitely need an xxs in. i like things not too tight, but this was too roomy so the style was lost. it was a little long, but i think that is because it kind of hung on me. the material is light but substantial. it has a lot of stretch to it, which is very nice. it has a silky feel - could be worn dressy or every day. a very good dress all around. waiting for the xxs to come in - i would definitely recommend it.
other Beautiful top but disappointed that the top was so sheer. i'm 5"2, 120 and i ordered my usual xs. fit perfectly but may exchange for a s as i was hoping for it to be a little longer (hits right below my waist).
other Based on the two reviews on this skirt and, for the sale price i purchased the small--i 'm usually a large/extra large. i carry my weight in the middle, and this skirt stills works. very sofisticated striping, slimming! i haven't experienced any slipping, but i haven't worn it for any great length of time yet. there are numerous ways to create chic looks.
other Nothing "skinny" about these pants. they're very cute. great quality. but they run a good one size large. size down!
other I love the colors and pattern on this dress, and it's nice that it has a lining so no slip needed.  the cut works perfectly for my big booty figure however, i'm pretty small up top, and the neckline comes pretty low, so i either have to wear my craziest push-up bra, or get the top altered. i haven't decided what my plan is yet, but will keep the dress for sure.
other Very cute, and well made. fits true to size.
other The wash on these jeans made my hips look twice as big. that in combination with the looser boyfriend cut was not flattering. quality was excellent. denim was thick with the right amount of stretch. unfortunately they had to go back.
other Love love love this jumpsuit! normally i stay away from jumpsuits because i hate to have to completely undress to use the bathroom, but this was too cute to pass up. fits great, extremely flattering to my athletic build, super comfy. it sort of looks like a maxi-dress due to the wide legs. length was perfect. i am 5'3" and did not have to hem it.
other These pants are so fun. i love the pattern and color. can be dressed up or down. very flattering.highly recommend trying them on, they were better than i expected them to be
3 I agree with the other two reviews. it is so disappointing that this adorable dress isn't lined. the fabric is paper thin! this is an a-line style dress with pockets that need to be ironed down to prevent it making you look hippy. i sized down to a petite xs. i normally buy the petite smalls but they were out of it. i would say that this dress runs a little on the large size.
other I tried this dress on at my local store and was very disappointed in the slip portion of this dress. there is no give with the slip so even though the dress portion is quite flowy the slip prevents anyone with a large chest or hips to wear this dress.
other Very flattering, the material is not the softest but it's an easy one to throw on with jeans
other I adore this top. lovely color, fit is very flattering. can dress up for work with a skirt, or down with jeans.
other I tried this jumpsuit on in the store and loved it but decided to wait on purchasing it. after it went on sale i jumped on it because i new i would regret not buying it. i am tall but most of my height is from my long legs, not in my torso. i seldom find jumpsuits that fit my frame but his one fits perfectly. the fabric is very "flowey" and does not wrinkle. the overall design of this jumpsuit is slightly but not overly baggy. the pattern and pleating make it a perfect item for spring and su
other I just love this. well made, nice fabric and looks just great over pants or jeans. im very pleased with this quirky piece and got it on sale too!
other This dress has all the hallmarks of a classic. the fit of the bodice is form enhancing but modest and the flare is very feminine and swingy. i love the soft denim fabric though it smelled funny out of the package and i had to air it out. i am 140# 36dd and bought the size 8.
other I am normally a 4, but they only had the white in size 2, so i tried it. i was pleased to see that it worked out just fine because it is meant to flow, therefore has plenty of fabric. it is very graceful and very pleasant to wear. i don't know how to explain it, but i had to take a second look when i saw it on the photograph because i was not sure it was the same blouse. much better in reality than on the picture.
other I ordered a size large.  i recently had a baby and was looking for a top to hide my baby belly until i lose it.  this shirt fits amazingly.  i don't find the sleeves to be snug at all.  if the shirt wasn't so distinctive, i'd order in several colors.  the quality is fantastic for a tee and has a nubbed appearance you can't see in the photos.
other Adorable & comfortable. i'm 5'3", 11other lbs, and ordered an xs.
other Very cute top but runs very very big ! imother ft other in tall, 120 lbs. i ordered the xs but it was so big it looked like a maternity top.. sadly returned the top. otherwise the top was made of good quality fabric.
other I like the pointelle feature in the front. i end up wearing a lot of black, but this at least gives me the option to do a bit of color underneath if i so chose. i've worn this with white, black and blue jeans w/ boots. looks great. i'm 5'3" and 12other lbs. i got a medium, but i could have possibly gone with a small. my only complaint is that it might be a tad bit too long. since i'm on the shorter size, i can't imagine it would be too much of an issue for others.
other First, i'm an 8/10 and tried the s and m. i could've worn either but the m looked too large in my opinion. i kept the small. the color- i think you could wear black or navy as the navy is very very dark. the only con- the sleeves. they stick right out to the sides and don't lay down as much as the online photo. it definitely looks best with a cardigan or jacket over it. material is super light.
3 I love the back detail but doesn't feel that comfortable on. i bought in green. it's fitted so get size larger if you plan to layer up. i'm 107 and bought xs size. i should have ordered the s.
other It definitely smells like vinegar but it went away after a few hours. i don't think its itchy. its kind of baggy and kind of has an ombrã© look to it fading down to darker. it looks casual in the pic but i can wear it out at night with cute earrings
other I love that the dress slip got a different pattern. very easy fun for summer but you can also layer it in fall
3 This top is beautiful to look at but did not fit me like the model. it was tight across the bust but very poofy at the bottom, which normally i like, but not this time. sad.
3 Usually can just buy tiny shirts knowing that they will fit me!  and this one is beautiful but if you have any type of chest it will not work.  i'm a 34d and itwas way too small in the chest area.  it is a beautiful shirt though and i'm very sad that i have to return it.  it will work better on someone else for sure.  so i recommend this beautiful shirt for someone with a different body type from mine!
other I ordered this coat in a size xs during the promo. it just arrived & is too big. sleeves way too long & big under the arms. it's labeled xs but looks more like a m. i don't mind an oversized fit & having the sleeves altered but this is just not working. if petite were available it may work for me. it is nicely made, soft, comfy, button front which i prefer instead of snaps. i think it wld be super cozy on a cold day. love the print! i am of small build, 5'3", 115#, usually a xs-s, occas petite.
other I was looking for a red and black plaid top with a twist, and this tee definitely fits the bill! i plan to wear this shirt with a long sleeve tee under it for extra warmth for casual holiday events, and can see it with a skirt and cardi for work. fabric is soft and comfortable. fit is loose but not too boxy.
other Just got this vest in my store yesterday and i was immediately drawn to it. the outside of the vest is this thick knit in an oatmeal color and a bright cobalt blue (even brighter than it appears online). the inside is a jersey knit fabric in grey. its an eye catcher for sure. i knew i needed to try it on. the vest is longer in length (like it appears in the photos). my only gripe is the fit. its great around the neck...nice and full. but i wish the body of the vest was larger. it fits very much
3 I liked it online, but i didn't want to pay shipping for something i wasn't sure if it is good. when i saw one size other in the store, i was excited to try it on. however, it didn't quite meet the expectation. the dress fits a little loose (donna morgan size other fits me better), and it is not lined at all. the separate top piece is just way too big without any shape. there must be a clip on the back of the top shown on the model to make it look smaller. i love the blue floral print, but that is the o
other I cant say enough about this top. the material is soft and comfy . very well made. the length and  size is spot on! looks great tucked in or out! very versatile. highly recommend!!
other I ordered this in grey first but didn't care for the black lace ---- so, decided to try the cream/beige/neutral and i just love it. i have areas i am trying to "cover up" and this really fits the bill without looking too much like an oversized tunic. the back is the clincher. different and surprising. washes excellently, but i did line dry as i was afraid of shrinkage. if there are any left you won't be sorry and the neutral color looks good on almost everyone!
other I saw this jacket in a store and wanted it right then and there. i bought a shirt and scarf instead but it was on my mind. when i saw it on sale i grabbed it. the fit is a little boxy but the length was perfect! not too short. the small amount of spandex is so comfortable. it is versatile because the green arms can go with colored jeans well. i am 5'4". i can wear a med or large. i bought the large. it fits perfectly to layer short or long sleeves. not a typical denim jacket. looks great over a
other I was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for spring/summer. for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses. the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all. the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown. this dress has no shape to it, although probably comfortable, not flattering. i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture, in person.
other I love the texture and sheen of corduroy combined with this beautiful evergreen color. i purchased size 10 and the somewhat stretchy fit accommodates my bust size (36dd) with a blouse or slim fitting sweater quite well. i think the skirt flares out too much and ends a little too low for my height, so i'm waiting for the petite to arrive to see if it's more flattering. i picked tts but may be a bit large for those who are less busty, so you may want to size down if you're slender or pear shaped.
other Loved this jacket so much i bought both colors! this jacket is simple yet adds so much to an outfit. the lightweight material makes it perfect for the florida seasons. as for the snaps mine work perfectly i usually just keep them undone for my hands. the sizing i think runs a bit large. i usually am a medium but ordered smalls and they fit perfectly even with the perfect amount of breathing room. highly recommend
3 For reference: 5'3, 130#, athletic/muscular body type (broad shoulders, slim hips)i ordered the small and i was absolutely swimming in it. perhaps the petite would have been better, but there was just too much fabric everywhere. the sleeves were ridiculous on me, and even cinching the waist with a belt just wouldn't have slimmed the silhouette for me. i have muscular shoulders, and 34d chest, so the top fit as it should, just everything became way too much elsewhere. the fabric was soft and sw
other I was very excited to receive this dress because of the cute photo. however, upon arrival i was completely disappointed. the color is much more drab than the photo. the smudged polkadots weren't attractive. there were many little bumps and pulls in the linen. the dress is super heavy. the pleats around the waist did not lay correctly.and it adds 10 pounds to your hips! super sad! i am sending it back.
other These pants run small by two sizes or so. nice material, color true to picture.
other These are very cool leggings. the cut out design really puts them several classes above a simple black legging. they can be worn with dressier tops and could be a sophisticated looking outfit. i wore them for the first time today and really loved them. i didn't feel like i was out in "leggings" but more like i was wearing a nice pair of pants. the fabric is soft and the cut is very flattering all over - including the rear. they are definitely sculpting and firming. they fit the same size-wise as
other However, i unfortunately followed others advice saying these run small. i had to return/ exchange to a 00p. in turn had to give up the sassy red and settle for black. although they are beautiful trousers in black as well...
other I love this shirt. i have it in black and purple. i found the fit tts and looks great casually with a scarf or dressed up with a nice necklace. you can't go wrong with a cute long sleeve shirt that is soft. i like the length goes just past my bottom in the back but not overwhelming.it is more fitted than last years style.
other Just buy this dress! the slip, the hem, the print. everything about it!!
other Fit tts, very flattering and slimming with fitted thighs and slight flare. can be dressed up given the beautiful and classy dark wash. the hint of stretch makes them super comfortable. the only thing is, they are very long, will have to hem unless you are 6 ft tall. in my 5'other case i'm afraid the hemming will take away some of the flare effect. ag, please make pants with realistic length! still, very happy, especially since i was lucky to get my size during a promo.
other Yikes. there is a whole lot of skirt here. i am 5"4, weigh around 120 lb, and usually wear anywhere between a four and six in retailer clothing, depending on the designer. this skirt balloons out from the waist. on the website it seems to flow more naturally from the waist. i think that the flowers are cute but the material is cheap looking. the skirt is very long- hitting way below mid-calf. there is also tons of material - creating a parachute effect. definitely returning.
other This dress is stunning. i loved the cut and seam detailing. it is very flattering...if it fits. i have a curvy athletic build and usually wear a size 10/12. i am also smaller busted and this dress was too tight around my ribs, back and tummy. i bought the large and it doesn't' come in a bigger size :( it is very well made and completely lines. i highly recommend this dress but again only it if fits you.
other I bought these in 'vintage sage' and i grab for them as often as my favorite skinny jeans. if you are just dipping your toe in colored pants i would reccomend the same color, it is undertsated and easily paired with so many other colors. the legs run a little big but the waist is tru to size, so for comfort i went with my usual size.
other I bought this dress in burnt orange for my 19 year-old collage daughter. she loved it and has found many opportunities to wear it on campus. she said it is so comfortable and perfect with a sweater for cool fall mornings and sleeveless as the day warms up.
other Love this dress! it's a little roomy on me & i maybe should have gone with the medium. i'm 5'11" and about 16other so usually wear a large. my problem is with the length. i knew it was a gamble, but the other color images on the 5'10" model gave me the hope that the dress would come close to being near my knees ... nope. it's a good 6" above them, and i couldn't wear this to work. so being the crafty sort, i'm pondering adding a few more lace layers to the hem.
other I love the fabric of this shirt -- it's super soft. however the fit is off -- i'm normally a medium and the buttons across the chest were gaping open when buttoned (never a problem for me, i'm a 34b and not very busty). it is also a bit on the short side, especially when the general trend is toward longer shirts/tunics. i would recommend sizing up (in fact i'm going to try this in a large, fingers crossed...)
3 I love these pants but be care when you do laundry. the dye transferred to another pair of pilcro chinos that was a little lighter color. very frustrating. label mentioned it but i only noticed after it happened because the colors are both not that dark at all.
other I absolutely love this sweater!! it's soft, easy to wash, and looks great!
other I love this top. i'm wearing it today. i bought it to wear under blazers and it works perfectly. i knew it would be slim fitting and while i normally buy med or sometimes small i bought the large and i'm glad i did. it's still form fitting without strangling me the color is very nice as well. nice fabric and well made. a great layering basic.
other I love this jacket. it's easy to dress up or be casual. the black is more like a very dark grey.
other I ordered this in my usual size small (36b bust, 5'5", around 116 lbs), but the seam around the high waist stuck out and didn't cinch in at the waist at all, rather bubbled out a bit. the tunic "flaps" laid strangely as well, like they were too small almost. the high cut sides were indeed high cut...showing the waistband of my leggings. apparently that is a new style, as i have seen a few other tops like it around, but i question whether slits that high are appropriate for actual wear outside on
other I agree with all of the reviews. the design and fit are wonderful if you can get it on.! the buttons are a nightmare! whoever made these clesrly sewed the loopholes on the buttons closed with no thought as how to open them or get them off. ridiculous! they need to put a side zipper on this as i will probably check into since i really want to keep it. so so so disappointing
other Beautiful and soft and so well made cropped cardigan by the in house retailer branding. the color is more muted in person but will work with many different skirts and pants including jeans. i have many ideas for this lovely cardigan ! the size medium for my 3other dd chest, 14other lbs and other 'other inches is perfect and the sleeves bellow out a bit which gives this cardigan a nice sharp look. i agree with the other reviewer--- more colors and more of type of quality  and character please for seasons ahead! lo
other Bought on a whim as a gift for my mom, fit perfectly and she loved the details. did not complain of itching as with prior review. it is more blue than gray appearing the photo.
3 I ordered online and wear xs- m. i ordered a small but it seems big. i have to drive 1+ hour to a store so i do a lot of online ordering. i'm thinking of returning for smaller size. may make a road trip- have several items to return! i hate paying shipping to buy and shipping to return if it doesn't work!
other These have a great fit & design. i ordered a size larger after reading that this style runs on the small size. typically i'm a 27 but ordered a 28. the wash has a great vintage feel about it! i also love that these do not lose their shape after wearing all day.
other Loved this dress online, but my small pettie stature made me looks like an orphan from the prairie.
3 I loved this sweater when i bought it. wore it a couple times then washed it according to the tag. it shrunk at least two sizes! and the tassels got all tangled (which i guess i should have seen coming). pretty bummed about it because this sweater looked beautiful on.
3 I loved the concept of the dress and that is why i chose to keep it in spite of the negatives. the grey color is drab, yet leaves room for creativity. it's stylish yet wrinkles horribly. i am 5' 2" so it hangs too low in the front and armpits. another reviewer mentioned the buttons, yet there should be one more to bring it up in the chest. the pockets are a great space for hands, yet fabric is too thin and they are side slits, so will not hold much. i typically wear a other petite and the small fits
other These shorts are super soft and comfortable. i am normally a size 27 or a other in shorts. i got a size 26 in these shorts and they are still large. i exchanged them for a 2other and they fit perfectly. so these run 1-other sizes large. other than sizing, these shorts are perfectly comfortable and functional.
other This maxi dress is exactly what i had in mind! the fabric is very comfortable. the print is very nice. perfect find!
other This is a good basic casual skirt, and the grayish color is a great neutral. i saw it in store just kind of hanging by itself and decided to try it on. i usually wear a 6 in skirts, but always have to size up in hd so i grabbed an 8, which fit well. i will say it's definitely a little snug though, even sizing up. the fabric is soft and flowy, and will work well for both late summer and early fall. i'd recommend it.
other This dress is super cute and has the most striking color (i got the blue). i just love it. it's comfortable and flattering and hits me in all the right places. i am a petite girl and normally wear a 0 or other in retailer dresses, and, as the other reviewers mentioned, this runs small, so a other was what i needed, and even the other does not leave any wiggle room. that said, i like my dresses to fit sort of snugly so it works for me. i highly recommend it overall - the quality, cut, color, and comfort all ma
other I love this top. i wear it all the time.  the problem is that you can tell i wear it all the time as the fabric has started to fade.  i'd still recommend it as it is so comfortable.
other These are amazing quality. i agree, size up to not have such a sheer effect. i would not wear them as just leggings without a long shirt covering the butt.they are warm. i wore them under some ski stuff. kept me warm.i also washed them on handwash cycle. seemed to be ok.
other I saw this in the store and fell in love with it! i normally wear between a 29 and 30 in pants and the medium fit great. it is a very generous cut in the leg and the waist has an elastic band in the back. i'm 5'5" and the pants almost graze the top of my foot, perfect for sandals. if i had seen this stock photo first i would have been totally off-put by the culotte length, but i guess that's what it looks like on a model! there are cute buttons that run down the outside length of the pants and t
other Love love this dress! i got the regular size, but the length is more on the petite side. it's shorter than what i'm comfortable with, so will probably return it.
other I really like this dress. i tried it on in the store and i had to take it home with me. the print is fun and bright and interesting, without being over the top. the grommets give it a little bit of edgy balance to the sweet, flowy shape.a note on the the fit: i am a 12/1other and the 1other fit well. it is a bit loose in some places, like the waist, but it certainly doesn't look like a maternity dress. i think the looseness is a good part of the overall look. i am high-waisted, and the waistline hit
other This is great and very soft inside. i am wearing it around my house all the time. great over workout clothes or jeans and leggings.
other Even at 5'1" this kimono works for me. because it's so light in weight the length and amount of fabric are not at all overwhelming. it can be dressy or casual, as others have noted.
other I actually love the thickness of the cotton fabric on this top. i am tired of too thin shirts that develop holes right away. i love the color too.i am usually a medium and the medium fits well, if a little roomy.
other I was so excited to receive the playa tunic in the mail! i love the colors and the flowy bottom and raw edges. this tunic could be worn as a dress or with jeggings, jeans, or leggings. this is a wonderful fall transition piece!!
other Love this white shirt! it fits great and gives you a little breathing room around the waist. this goes with shorts, skirts, and jeans. i will be wearing it all summer
other A fun top!i tried on both the medium and large (i'm between sizes, 5'4", 34g) and preferred the large. the medium waist rode up a bit on my torso, so the large stayed down a bit. also, the medium pleats did not fall as nicely on my chest.
3 I loved this shirt online and ordered it in blue immediately even though i usually hesitate to spend over $100 on casual blouses. unfortunately, i was super disappointed when it arrived. the lace does not contrast as much as shown in these pictures and it just doesn't look all that special. having said that, it is super comfy and soft and the sizing is generous - it may run big on you if you have a small chest. all in all, i would buy it on sale but certainly not worth the price tag!
other Cute and comfy! i usually wear a small but bought a medium because it appeared to run a little small.
other This jumpsuit is fabulous in person! it is elegant and easy and very figure flattering. i have a very curvy shape but a 3other ddd bust so i would say i am a top heavy hourglass. this jumpsuit does me right. the only thing i would say is i don't think it would be very comfortable on a person with a long torso. i am 5'3" and bought this in 6 regular and the length is perfect with heels. but the whole top half fits me perfectly but shows alot of boob if i'm not careful. but i don't think it would be s
other This skirt is great, a classic. the little dots on the skirt give it some character while remaining a simple black and flattering skirt. the material lays nicely and flat. it does not make me look like i have a stomach. the skirt fits tts. i am a little afraid that the waistband will stretch out over time so i might exchange it for one size smaller. overall, i love the skirt!
other This is one of my absolute favorites! the design is perfect, and the fabric is so beautiful. i don't love the coral color, but the mixed pattern is amazing. it runs a little large. i sized down one size and it fit perfectly. it's very flowy and comfortable. it's these unique, special designs that end of being my favorite retailer purchases. i've gotten so many compliments. very highly recommend!
other This top is delicate and so feminine. it is beautiful. does run small. i had to size up. i'm usually a 6-8 m and had to buy l. it has no stretch.  so i needed room for movement.
other It is very hard to find a great midi denim skirt. pomona's is very stylish, well made, and looks great on. i had to exchange my size 10 for a size 1other and am awaiting its arrival, remaining hopeful it will provide a better fit. first time in my life i have purchased a 1other so can't say for sure whether the skirt runs small or i am now running larger. i recommend this skirt.
other I was looking for a dress for my engagement pictures and once i saw this dress i knew it was the one! i ordered the white in a small (size 2) i am 5'other 130lbs. it fits perfect and the length is just right. some reviews said it's boxy and has too much flow to it but if you have the right size it won't be an issue! yes, it's a lace dress so it's going to be delicate and you'll need to handle with care. but it's worth it, absolutely stunning!
other Very comfortable, material is good, cut out on sleeves flattering
other I purchased this blouse over the summer and it's very pretty. i love the cap sleeves with the lace and the detail in the front. it can be dressed up or dressed down, my only complaint is that it wrinkles very easily.
other Beautiful sweatshirt top that can be worn to work.
other Love it! as a previous reviewer stated, you can actually wear it reversible.so happy i purchased it!
other I absolutely love this blouse. it is so soft, easy to wear and can be worn with so many things. i'm 5'3, 13other pounds and got a small (regular). i could've gone for the petite but decided to do regular. love it!
other This dress is adorable, but it unfortunately didn't work for me. i agree with the reviews that stated the fabric is very heavy
other This sweater is light gray, as shown in the photo, not dark gray as the description states. i went up from my usual size so would say it runs small. it is lightweight enough that i think i will get adequate use out of it this winter in fl.
other This is a lovely blouse. i think is a bit roomy, but even so, i like the look. i have to dress business casual for work and this blouse fits the bill as it's not too casual.
other I love the pattern, but the color was not great on my skin tone. i tried on the regular size and it wasn't great. teh cut could work, but overall, i didn't feel like it was enough for me to order the petite to see, and i sometimes do. in a tall darker toned person, this would be gorgeous. what i like the most is the color pattern in the print, and shimmer.
other These pants are very comfortable i love putting my phone and wallet in the front big pocket so cool the linen is soft fits greatthe tie dye is very unique love it!
other Great fabric and design, beautiful pattern with flattering angled bottom hem and fringe. so soft and comfortable.  the hood is cuter left down. perfect transitional piece for fall.  i got the neutral color and it is so easy to wear.  i'm 5'3" and got the s/xs size and feel that it is still wearable.  i second the opinion one reviewer mentioned about wearing a belt through the slit over the front part. definitely works well and makes for an effortlessly stylish look.
other Absolutely love these. i ordered them in bronze and i'm thinking about getting the lilac pair as well. they're super comfortable and look great on.
other This top is so unbelievably cute! the fit is perfect and it goes with just about anything on the bottom. i personally styled mine with high waisted distressed skinny jeans and it looks adorable. its a tiny bit see-thru, so you do need to wear a tank under it.
other I was hesitant to buy this due to the price but so i glad i did when it came in the mail. great quality and surprisingly thick silky fabric. very comfortable and the shimmery thread detail is beautiful. could be very warm in the summer due to the thick tweed like fabric. fits and looks true to size just like it does on the model.
other I saw this dress online first and suspected i would like it, but the price scared me away. then, while visiting in portland, i saw it on sale at an retailer store. when i came out of the dressing room to look in a bigger mirror the store clerk said, "well that's a no-brainer!" i thought the same thing. i love this dress so much i actually would have paid full price for it. it's super fun and easy to wear; i paired it with navy blute tights and suede ankle booties. i'm 5'6, 138 lbs and the m
other This top is very flattering, the fabric flows and moves. it fits perfectly (slim cut), but hides tummy bulges and other imperfections. and it's slimming too. can be dressed up or down, goes with everything. i ended up buying all three colors, and if there were more, i would buy more!
other Excellent quality blouse and sooo pretyy!! i was worried when i saw on-line that is 100 % cotton. i though it was a cotton blouse that would get wrinkly. but i was pleasantly surprised when i saw it in the store! it is a substantial weight cotton/gauze that looks like hand stitched embroidery. i'd say it fits tts.
3 Glad i got this on sale. it is more yellow than the photo & short. it is also heavy with a sueded interior. would have given more stars if it was less boxy & longer.
other Definitely size down it does run large however, it is a sweet floral print made of rayon so i would dry clean as rayon shrinks. i love tunic lengths and this one is a bit longer than most tunics but for me still works. there are other small pleats on the front and the ruffles on the neckline are a nice touch. it is made well. i have a long black sweater that will make this work right into the fall and winter.
other I think i will really love this skirt. it is comfortable and has a lovely sheerness to it. it does have a bit of a weird, long drop waist, but it is very comfortable and still manages to be flattering. i think this will be a great piece for transitioning to the fall and winter seasons. i can wear it with short sleeves now and sweaters soon. i am happy with my purchase.
other I love the length of this top and i love tops that don't cling in the tummy area. it fits well and the crochet detailing is nice. for reference, i'm 5'.4.5", 150 lbs, 34dd and the m fit me well. since i'll be wearing this with leggings mostly during colder months, this top is a little bright and the material is not meant for cold days. since i live in texas, i can get away wearing it even in colder months.
3 If you look closely at the pictures this dress is shown other different ways. one with a lace covered v-neck and one with a rounded neck. which is it retailer? don't know about the size but i had to answer the question. i won't order the dress until i know exactly which style i'm ordering.
3 This dress has a nice flow and it is simple but versatile. you can pair it with a jacket or cardigan for the winter and use it year round. however it runs one size large.
3 Love the warm fuzzies of this sweater, did not love the unflattering cut. the sweater hung lifelessly from my bust line down. plus, it was a little short in the front. i have to send it back. :(
other I just got a pair of these in petite 28. and really like them. i am short though so even the petite length is too long for me- i wish it was the height of the cuff shorter than it is so i end up folding the cuff up. it still looks cute though. the stitching details are nice and quality seems good. hoping they hold up. the fabric seems durable if not a little too thick for hot summer weather but great for indoor a/c office temperatures. i am not going to buy another pair at full price but would c
other I love this tee s much i bought 3 different colors! the back is beautiful. it is so comfy and soft but its added spice makes it perfect for those times you want a little more style.
other I love to layer and this is a great layering piece. it is wonderful for cool crisp mornings . this cardigan looks great with skinny jeans and a cute tee. the model in the photo shows a super way to look great for a casual day. so soft and comfortable, i did not want to take it off on the cloudy day it was worn. very happy with this purchase and delighted i was able to get it on sale.
other I love the teal color of this t-shirt and the macrame design at the top is beautiful, however, the top is way too large.  i usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops, so i ordered the size s, there is so much fabric below the chest it fits like a maternity top.  i know if i order an xs, i will have the same problem.  below the bust, the top is not flattering and it&amp;#39;s a shame.
3 I absolutely love the look of this shirt with the built in layering piece. the overall garment is lightweight and not too heavy even with the added layer. however; this runs really large. in general, this brand runs large for me and i would say that if you are used to this brand, you can stick with your normal sizing for this brand. however; compared to other brands it runs very large. i think it would work fantastic for me in a different size. it is not at all fitting so it would be more like a
other The essence of femininity. simply beautiful. if you begin with the pattern of the dress, you become drawn to it. then, as you look closer and see the slip with its creamy detailed embroidery, and immediately you see how the dress opens at the bodice with tiny, set buttons, you soon realize, that's not all... the bottom of this fine piece of art continues with soft, delicate, chiffon trim with a bonus layer of the most beautiful lace to finish it off. i bought it on sight and just love it. i was
3 I am so bummed. these jeans are the perfect weight, totally distressed (and torn) in a way that looks like you've owned them for years, they flare out at the bottom of the legs just the right amount...but there is one huge - or i should write small - problem: your thighs have to be incredibly small to get these pulled all the way on. ----------i am a 27 in level 99 and ag brand jeans, and a 28 in my other pairs of coh jeans and in mih jeans as well. i do not have an hourglass figure (my shou
other I honestly don't understand whey this top isn't sold out. i have it in both colors and love it! it's a cool, gauzy woven fabric, super soft and perfect for warm weather. the white fabric is doubled so it's not see-through, the pink (more of a pale terracotta) is doubled halfway up, so it's slightly sheer on top but your pants/skirt waistband will not show through. it is a loose-fitting top, so you may be able to size down. i usually wear size 4p, but it was sold out so i got regular size other and i
other Very cool top! i purchased this in the black, which is more of a very dark gray (imagine sanded silk). it's very figure flattering and accentuates curves. it also disguises any minor tummy issues. not to clingy, but follows your form. the fabric is well made with a perfect drape to match the style. definitely a winner!
other I really liked this shirt the one time i got to wear it...but when i washed it, according to the directions on the tag, it shrunk! a lot! the sleeves are now too tight, and it is much shorter. thinking about returning it to the store, but in any case, i cannot wear it again.
other The online pictures do not do this dress justice. the materials between the top and skirt are different with the black part being a soft, sweater feel and the bottom part being an appropriately thick knit feel. the contract is stunning and is largely washed out in the online pictures. this is not the kind of dress you see on a rack and think "oh my gosh, that's the one!" but if you try it on, you will have this moment. it is comfortable, flattering, and slimming-a prefect everyday dress.
other I've read the previous reviews about this dress and was hesitant to order it but i'm so happy i did! i can definitely understand why certain reviews are saying that the fabric is cheap. it is an extremely thin material as well as a thin lining.  however i think it depends on the person. because neither of those things actually bother me. i get hot very easily so i appreciate the fact that this dress is very thin and flowy.  i think it's extremely comfortable and looks very cute on.  the zipper d
other The perfect cardigan for transitional seasons! i live in southern vermont and i can already tell this cardigan will be in heavy rotation during the summer to fall and spring to winter transition times. has such a cute back detailing that gives you a break from your common cardigans. great quality. i'm 126 lbs 5'other and i got the small petite and is perfect if you want it to be slightly loose but not swimming in it!
other I was so excited for this kimono. i thought the colors would be lovely. i was looking for a unique wrap/vest/kimono. i ordered this online expecting to be dazzled. sadly, i was not. this arrived and fell short on all measures. the colors were flat, the fabric felt cheap and the construction did not scream $108. it felt like something i would find in a college import/head shop. back it went. i ended up buying the silves wrap, which i love.
other I disagree with the most recent review! they are legging style fit but not leggings at all! they are a jean style with a patterning on them a texture.great colors!
other I really liked this jumpsuit but it just wasn't perfect. the design at the top is a bit stiff compared to the rest of the jumpsuit. i felt the whole thing ran just slightly too large. it was nice - but not amazing.
other I am very happy with this poncho/sweater. it is my first cashmere sweater and it feels so soft and luxurious! true, it does not have full length sleeves, but if you adjust the sweater so that it comes down lower on your shoulders, it will come well past your elbows, covering most of your arms. i feel very elegant wearing it. looks great with skinny pants or leggings and boots. would recommend,
other I just got this dress and am so excited to have it hanging in my closet, i've been eyeing it for a long time and am glad i got it on sale. i felt like a greek goddess when i tried this on and cannot wait to wear it. it fits like it was made just for me. the outer material is a little heavier than expected but it not a problem, the second layer is form fitting and soft. i feel like the restricted opening at the bottom forces me to slow down, like a lady and take in my surroundings, after all life
other This is a skirt i will wear every day in the summer...great green/khaki color, casual. fit me like all the retailer size8's do...perfect... only one thing...it is not as short as it looks on this model. i am going to have to have it shortened...but that is not biggy. the skirt is everything i hoped t would be and i know i will wear it to death.
other I have the purple and the white. i purchased the purple first in m. it wasn't too big to return, but it was a little roomier than necessary but when i saw the white on sale, i purchased it in s which fit just fine--still plenty roomy as the style allows. both these are cute alone and also with a little sweater or denim jacket. i haven't washed them yet but i imagine washing on delicate with a good gentle detergent will keep them looking nice for a long time.
other This is such a cool top/sweater. i like simple designs with a twist and the sleeves add that. great with skinnies and heels
other These chinos fit great! they are extremely comfortable and true to size but note that they do loosen up quite a bit with wear. i bought all 3 colors!
other I got the small even though i usually order a medium for sweaters because i prefer them bigger and i'm glad i got the small. the sleeves are very long (which i love) and the sweater is also loose fitting (also, love). the color is gorgeous and it is thick but super soft. i wouldn't wear anything underneath it unless tucked in because the front just comes to the top of my pants. overall, it's gorgeous and i would definitely recommend this!!
other Bought this for a summer wedding, it fit great and i got a lot of compliments!
other This vest is so cute and flattering. these pictures don't do it justice. you must see it in person and try it on. it only has a small percentage of wool in it, so it could easily be worn in the spring/summer with a tank.
other I absolutely love this sweater....it is perfect for fall
3 I love the feel and quality of these pants, however, they ran super big! they would not stay up around my waist, unfortunately.
3 Disappointed with the fit and color of this sweater. more of a rusty red then bright cherry red. i ordered a small and found the sweater had no shape and just hung lumpy on me. i am 5'other 120 and usually a small in retailer sweaters.
other I've been looking for a new winter dress and this one fit the order! it's warm yet flattering and i love the color.
other I wanted to love this sweater. the color is gorgeous, the pattern unusual, it is soft and warm, and would have gone with so many things. but the cut is awful. mainly the sleeves are way too big, making me look misshapen and my arms look huge. the body was a bit boxy but that would have been workable if the arms had been normal. too bad.
other Walked into the retailer store in new york, while on vacation, and saw this on display. had to try it on immediately and loved the look. received several compliments from customers in the store. it's beautifully made, soft on the inside and makes a great statement piece that i will enjoy for years to come!! you will need to size down cause it runs large. i love it............
3 This dress is very pretty colorwise, but the fit did not work for me. i could see this working on girls with narrow hips, but it didn't flatter my narrow waist/wide hip frame.
other I have a closet full of dresses and very few have the quality and attention to detail as this gorgeous dress!often times when ordering online the dress that you actually receive will have a different fabric placement than the online photos.......and it can detract from the overall look.....but the one that i received is exactly as pictured. the gold details hit in all the right places.the quality is shocking! looks like a $2000 dress.true to size however, the chest/bust runs a little big.
other I saw this in my local store last night and was instantly drawn to the color. it is more greenish than yellow. i say this alot but this was so much prettier in person. i would not look twice at it online- the picture does it no justice. i am not a pancho person, but this looks very luxurious and expensive and it feels so soft and warm. i tried the xs/s and it fit perfect - i am typically a medium in other brands at antrho. it is boxy, but that is the point of a sweater of this type. it will be p
other I'm glad i listened to the other reviewers...i ordered a large instead of my usual medium. it's roomy enough for a sweater underneath. i love the denim! it's very soft and has some stretch. my other denim jackets are stiff even after years of washing. i also love the darker denim.
other Quirky tunic length top. has a windowpane print on the inside and the grey plaid looks like flannel but is cotton. the red burgandy embroidery adds punch and it has a boho flair. size down one size runs big.
other Not being into bright neon colors, i love this top! the fit is true to size and helps to hide my tummy. it's super cute and very flattering.
other Great quality, beautiful print, definitely a steal given its current sale price. it does run large. order a size smaller. works perfect with a belt!
other I'm 5' 120 lbs. i'm posting a photo. one lady was concerned about it being ok for the over 40 crowd. i wore it was a cami under. see pic. it is comfy. it has pockets and fits beautifully. i ordered a 6petite. it's a little long on me. buy i still like it and am enjoying wearing it.
other I really love the look and style of these. i am not a fan of thong underwear; definitely prefer these bikini or "hipster" styles, but sometimes it's hard to find them in attractive design. this pair is definitely attractive and i like how they fit and look a lot. i've only worn them once and they held up well for the day -- i often find lace can rip on the first wear, so i was wary. they did okay, but i do worry that they seem delicate enough i could accidentally stuck a thumb through it and rip
other I fell in love with this shirt in the store and it has become one of my favorite items in my closet! the bright pink contrasts perfectly with the white peplum bottom and the fit is wonderfully flattering!
other I fell in love with this vest  the minute i saw it on the hanger.  it runs true to size and the material is excellent quality .  it looks great with jeans and a tee and also something dressier. i wore it over a navy blue wide-leg jumpsuit, and it looked truly amazing!  i  received so many compliments!  i also purchased the lace tie up top that it is featured with and can't wait for that to come in.
other I ordered this vest in xxs, since i am usually an xs and was looking for a bit of a tighter fit on such a loose vest. even then, the vest looked like a large. not only was it incredibly loose - much looser than in looks in the picture - but the arm holes were huge too. it just looked too big, not artfully drapey.
3 Absolutely stinning dress! statement piece for sure however i will agree with other reviews that the bust is small and has no give or wiggle room with the side zipper...one if those dreaded side zippers that you always fear breaking as you dress. sizing up would help but the waist then appears too big or bulky.. i am on the fence about whether or not it's a keeper ...definitely perfect for the smaller chested. i usually wear xs size 2/other the 6 zipped the other nearly did but would've smashed. neverth
other The little details are just beautiful. the embroidery and tassels are so cute. loose fitting just floats over the body. feels very light.
3 I like everything about this shirt except i wish the embroidery was on the back too. gives it a cheaper look by only having it on the front. you will look prettier coming than going for sure!
other This one is a must-buy. i have 3 of the longer sleeve version (the tegan dress) and one of these. i am about to buy more of the lola/ short sleeved version. these dresses are flattering and comfortable. they can be worn as a tunic with leggings or a dress. they are great for travel. if you roll them, they don't wrinkle. they can be dressed up or down. my sister and i have very different figures and this dress looks great on both of us. i can't recommend a dress more. the lola and the tegan are t
other I saw this dress worn on the street and thought it was lovely, the perfect work dress. i then found it in the store and my size was already sold out, so i visited another retailer, and another to find it. unfortunately the color blocking on the chest was not very flattering for me, it seemed to overly accentuate it. i am 5'9" a 36 dd size 12.the colors, the fabric are all wonderful. but this dress is not for me.
other I just discovered this dress a few days ago and it's simply dreamy!! i'd been searching for the perfect summer dress to wear to a wedding in june but had been highly disappointed in the selection of pastel colors from other shops. this dress is the perfect summer shade and will be perfect for the texas heat in june! i absolutely love how it flows and is elegant yet modest. the lace cut-outs are gorgeous!
other Love this top! off the shoulder fits great! little extra room around the torso than i'd love... but still absolutely in love with this top! the black lace detail on the bottom is amazing! love the colors for fall! ordered a small and i'm 5'9 138lbs and i ordered a small
other The "peachy" color read as pretty gold on me, which i think was good for my pale skin and sandy hair. the lavender accent color is also very nice. forgiving fit, elegant fabric, pretty print, respectable hemline, super flattering neckline, love the pockets... all in all, i think this dress is a nice choice for day events.
3 I like design of the dress, softness and color ( i got grey), the dress is shorter on me then on model ( 5'6" 14other lbs) i got m fits ok but i don't like fabric quality it seems like it can be peeled and picks up everything and needs to be sprayed all the time. despite i got it with 40% discount it will come back as it's poor quality.
other I was so excited to try these, it's hard to find cute bermuda shorts. the legs were so wide. my husband asked if i was wearing his shorts. they don't look that wide in the picture. i am 5'4" and 130 lbs i bought my regular size 28 but the waist was huge i could have sized down one or two sizes. unrolled they came to my knee.
other I was looking for a romper for a long time which i don't need to care whether to wear bras after taking shower and relax. because of its design with a line on the top, no worries for a relaxed romper. the texture was not as silky as i wished but you will like this if you want a light on weight.
other This is my favorite dress i've bought in the past year! it is super flattering and can be worn for work or casual wear. the fabric is soft and comfortable. can't wait till the weather gets warmer so i can start wearing it regularly!i'm 5'other 145lbs, 37-29-39. i got the medium petite and it fits perfectly!
other This top is comfortable and pretty plus, i like the extra length in the sleeves. it is very lightweight and i'm cold natured so, i wear a bra top tankini underneath for warmth.
other On a hot summer 90 degree day the blue ink on the dress stained the dress and my new tory burch bag. i would never have expected that the blue print would bleed all over me and my new dress. great dress and such a wonderful fit...too bad its unwearable now.
other I tried on the xs in store i typically need petite) and it was a great length for me, i think petite would be too short for me to wear to work. the xs was a little snug on the waist, but the rest of the skirt fit perfectly, so though it was snug, i think i would still buy the xs. (stretchy band). the cream color/ivory is a nice summery color, not see-through unless you have dark unders. flirty and overall nice and airy for warm summer days. 11other lbs, 26-27 inches waist)
other This looks just like the picture. it's soft and very comfortable - looks great with skinny jeans and boots. love it!
other I am a fan of these designers and their gorgeous fabrics - most of which are heavy brocades. this is so pretty and fun. the print is playful, and colors are gorgeous, and the fit is floaty but not too full or too tight. i love the bit of beading, and that i can dress it up or down.i am petite and not usually a bigger print or long dress fan, but i know that i will wear this one for years. i did get a 00 petite as i know that only this small size fits me at retailer - 0's swallow me. this i
other I ordered online. i sized up one size. it fit perfect. so flattering and so pretty. then i tried to take it off and the zipper stuck...badly. 30 minutes later i was sadly packing it up to ship back. the zipper is that awful.
3 I think this blouse would work for petites. it is super short and boxy. looked nothing like the fit on the model. sad to return it, love the print.
other This is definitely again, a bit big. i'm usually a med, that is what i got, i could have gotten a small, but the arm holes might have been a tad tight then. i'm keeping the med, in case it shrinks, as it is part rayon, and rayon always shrinks if put in the washer. it is a great casual piece that will go with most anything. i love the tie, as you can then tighten the waist up a bit, or leave looser. the material is soft and not clingy. this is why i love a rayon blend. it hits me below my waist
other This dress has a beautiful pattern, and is perfect for work. i wore it with tights recently, but could see wearing it in the summer too- the print is versatile enough that it translates. the top layer is sort of a crepe like fabric and there were a lot of strings that needed to be cut that were hanging off. i got many compliments the first time i wore this! i'm very curvy and i got the medium and it fits great and is very flattering.
3 This style of shirtdress usually fits me perfectly, however, this did not fit me one bit. the waist was too large, the length too short, and the hips too small. i was really hoping this would fit, since it's a unique color and the material is substantial but soft. i will be returning this.
other I think this shawl is much more stunning on than on the hanger. i think it will be a great piece to transition into fall, wearing it over a black or white tee. it can be dressed up or down. especially for the sale price, a great piece!
3 I ordered this and there is just so much fabric! in the pictures i think it is pinned in the back, in the main photo, to make it look more streamlined. definitely a miss!
other This dress is absolutely perfectly delightful! fits like a glove and is stunning on. i couldn't be happier with this purchase! i wore it to a wedding in october and felt beautiful and sexy all at the same time. i usually struggle with dresses because i am under other feet, i purchased a 0p and it fits very well. no tailoring needed. only problem was that once i was on the dance floor the hooks in the front of the dress began to come undone, yikes! i had to leave the dance floor a couple of times and
other I don't normally write reviews, but i love this shirt!  it's sooo soft and hangs perfectly. not to mention it takes what could be a boring t-shirt and makes it anything but that with the cute flutter sleeves. it's beyond comfortable. i purchased one and went back immediately to get another! i can tell these will be some of my go-to tees. plus, they are a steal on sale!  i am 5'5, 13other and medium is perfect.
other I was so excited to receive this dress. i got a petite other as i am 5'2". it was very hard to zip up the side zipper but not impossible. it didn't look good on me. the waist line was a bit too high...maybe a regular would have looked better. also i thought it was a cotton dress but it isn't. also i looked like i was going to a nordic folk festival to do a traditional dance. i had been so excited to receive this but sadly it just didn't work for me and i had to send it back.
other I purchased the blue & white pattern of this shirt. the color blue was bright and contrasted perfectly with the white color in the square design. this shirt worn with a white pair of slacks or a white skirt makes a perfect presentation for any occassion during the warm spring and summer months. the fit of the shirt was true to size. i love the longer length of this shirt because it elongates one's height. the cuffed sleeves are perfect in length. the classic style of this shirt guarantees many y
3 This lift weight cardigan is true to size, perfect for fall or spring. colors are quite nice, especially the little pops of orange.
other Perfect top! i love the mix of materials, silky in the front and comfy knit in the back. the tie on the side is adorable and adds a little something special to the shirt. happy!
other I really like this sweater a lot. it runs huge though. i have a m/l and i'm swimming in it (5'9" sz 12-14). i like the length and the swingy-ness. there's enough coverage for me to feel comfortable layering it over a bra cami and leggings. the shoulder detail is what makes it. the only downside is that the threads on the reverse side of the embroidery are a little rough, but not enough to bother me. the knitted fabric is soft and cool feeling. i plan on wearing it into fall with "real pants" and
other This top is beauitiful. gorgeous detailing with the eyelet lace, black flower appliquã©s, silver beads and tiny rose gold sequins down the front. true to size. i'm 5'2", 130 lbs, 34b and took my usual size 4. the slits do come up a bit far on the sides like another reviewer noted but not really enough to be a problem. i didn't find it necessary to get the petite size in this top. i was going to wait until further markdown since the top is still pricey even with a 20% discount but couldn't resist
3 I love these overalls  but they run very small?i had to return and reorder.
other This top is very pretty, i ordered both xs p and xxs p not knowing (someone wrote the word boxy in the review) - i tried on the xxs p first, and that was fine. did the trick to not look too boxy. teh fabric is stretchy, and soft/comfortable, not scratchy lace. the lining is soft as well. color is ivory and the embroidery is nice and fiery colors. the sleeves are fairly flattering, even on bigger arms. arm hole was just right too, never know with fluttery sleeves. for reference i am 11other lbs, 30
other I was very excited to receive this dress (online only so had to have shipped.) the colors are classic primary as shown. the outer fabric is heavy and canvas-like, but the lining is white nylon-ish. the length was good. the dress is nicely lined but sadly runs very small in the bust. i am a size 8 and a 34b and this dress was too small for me. i rarely have this issue. sadly, it's going back. i should have waited to read reviews and sized up. fyi the belt has a look that appears worn similar to p
3 This top is very pretty, but it fits funny. it's boxy and doesn't hang well. i feel like you could almost wear it as a 2nd-trimester-pregnancy-blouse. i tried the small & the small petite. they both fit the same (too big and too boxy), but the petite was shorter. i am 5'2", 125lbs, 34b. i preferred the regular length, but if you like your tops to end at your waistband, then the petite would fit too. i still really like the top, so i may try it in a smaller size when it goes on sale.
other I love this tshirt, but the speckled grey looks more like roof shingles in person. i'm going to try to exchange it for a different color.
other I loved the contrasting design of this sweater. i loved it even more when it arrived. its soft and true to size. i received so many compliments which sealed the deal.
other Love the fit - doesn't cling to my midsection and detail on sleeves is very pretty. fits true to size.i got the black but want to order it in other colors as well. can be dressed up or down.
other My stylist brought me the regular xs to try on in the store and almost told me i should buy it... the length seemed just fine, but i usually get petite so decided to order the xs petite before deciding... good decision, there is less fabric in the skirt, so it seemed anyway, so i am less overwhelmed buy the skirt. the cut is super flattering, and length was actually better (the longer sides hit ,me around the knee). i wasn't sold on the dolor, as i have pale skin, but there is enough dark to com
other I always search each summer for a maxi dress and this is the winner this summed! i love the way it wraps. fits perfectly. i got a size medium and i am 5'other 34dd; the dress is long enough to wear with flats or heels. i recommend this!
3 This is a beautiful coat nicely constructed and very warm. it was just too bulky for me and i looked 10 lbs heavier in it. i am 5'7" and 140 lbs. maybe it would be better suited to a more slender frame.
other I tried the b&w one in the store. liked the look and feel of it. fabric is soft and comfortable. for reference, i'm 5'4" and 11other lbs. this dress runs large. size 0 was too big on me - armhole, waist, length, etc. i'm ordering 0p online, hoping it will fit better. not a huge fan of the black belt, otherwise very happy with the dress.
other Loved these beach pants! i purchased the size medium in the coral. i loved the accents on the ties and the little pom pom details. i did get many compliments on them. the only thing i don't love about them is the material is very thin. i know they are beach pants but i personally would have liked slightly more weight to them. i wore them once with a pair of cropped leggings underneath and i thought it was a very cute way to wear them with some additional substance underneath.
other This is a great summer top! love the way it drapes and the quality of the material. bought the ivory and went back for the rust but my size is sold out. my only complaint is that it doesn't come in way more colors!
other I am a sucker for a good swing top. i own many styles from retailer and similar retailers. i carry my weight in my stomach butt and hips, so this style is always good for me. as soon as i saw this online i fell hard and waited patiently for it to arrive at my store. finally it did! i love this top. its very swingy. almost cut like a circle so there is tons of room in the body. the sleeve is more fitted, but my arms are larger so it might just be fitted for me. there is a bit of stretch to it. the
other This dress is so pretty. i loved the details on it. the material was ok. would have prefered a softer material so the bottom part of the dress would have been more flattering. unfortunately, it did not fit me right. i'm 5-2",34c, 28, 37 and the 4p fit ok. it hit just above my knees so the length was fine. what i did not like was that it was a little too loose around my waist making me look pregnant so unfortunately i had to send it back. i'm so sad cause this is a really pretty dress. you can dr
other Great sweater - very pretty and warm. i would say it fits true to size, but the fit itself/style is just a little roomier - just like on the model. i usually take an xs and the xs fit great.the tag says to dry clean or hand wash in cold. i always wash my wool sweaters in cold water, in a garment bag, on delicate wash and have never had a problem.but, when i did that for this sweater, it shrunk to a size that would fit a other year old. the fabric in the arms stuck together, like velcro. very inter
other This top is amazing!! i thought it looked really cute in the photos but it's even cuter online. the material is great and you can't go wrong with the fit. i love tops that are loose and flowy, so when i'm feeling a bit bloated i can still look cute in tops. this one is definitely a must!
other Tried these on several times in store and never bought them, but was able to get them with a 20% email- seemed like a better price for the product. the color is rust and a little odd for my wardrobe - wish they also came in black. love the style and they are very comfortable, perfect for late summer- can wear on errands or dress them up a little with shoes/accessories for casual dinner out. happy i finally purchased them!
other These cords are so soft and snug on- like a hug for your lower half! i appreciate their lack of stretch: they don't seem to "bag out" like other cords can. i like that the fabric is soft but the shape is more stiff. the grey is slightly lighter/more silvery in real life than the picture depicts. for ref, i'm 5'2" and 103lbs and i bought the 24p.
other I was so excited when i purchased this top! it was going to be my go to for running around, as it looked super cute with leggings and boots! the softness alone made me feel like i was wearing my pajamas.....so comfy! that all changed after one washing......it is now pilling and not nearly as soft as before! makes me sad, but it is going back!
other This shirt feels so nice, it's heavier weight and so soft.. i think it's lyocel... such a great drape to the shirt that is so flattering. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and 34c/d and purchased a size 4. found this item to be true to size, if not slightly loose, but i love the flow of it. highly recommend, the green is classic and timeless, very versatile.
other This dress makes me this of jackie kennedy on the beach in the summertime. i love the pattern and the pockets, oh my goodness the pockets! i saw this in the store and ordered one while i was there online because the ribbon on the zipper was frayed. well guess what we i got it in the mail at home the ribbon was also frayed. ugh. i kept it because it wasn't a huge deal breaker. the color is a little strange, not a true red more of a orangish red. i think it's super versatile and hopefully i will w
other This is a great blouse. the fabric is a fine rayon which is soft and has a lovely drape to it. i have found rayon to be a good fabric all year and quite cool in the summer. i am 5'7" long waisted and 127 lbs with a slender build so i usually wear a size 6--this fits perfectly as well as being quite flattering. it can be worn loose or belted with a contrasting or black belt over skinny jeans. it would also be swell with a pencil skirt. it will cover any fashion flaws! i usually like to shop the s
3 So sad!  this beautiful dress which i have been waiting to receive didn't work for me.  i'm a 5'7" hourglass girl and it just made me look big!  but i love the pattern and the way it looks on the photo online!  so sad but will return it!0
other I wish i had read all the reviews before purchasing. the sweater looked liked everything i would be interested in online. once i pulled it out of the bag, my first thought was how could retailer send me a used, washed and shrunken sweater. it is nothing like the picture. it fits like a midriff top, not exaggerating. i'm 5.6, ordered the m, don't waste your shipping money on this.
other This skirt is really cute and very comfortable. i can dress it up for work or dress it down for casual. fun color too.
other This is the perfect simple tank for summer. not clingy, and hangs really nicely, but not so billowy that you can't layer a nice wrap or cardigan over it. fabric feels like a great quality. i got it in white, and it's a bit sheer, but i typically layer my tanks anyway. tempted to get this in every color!
3 First, i love wool. if it's 100% wool, i love it. if wool isn't your thing, then this dress isn't for you. i ordered this dress online in the burgundy. it is not itchy. it falls above my knees and i am 5'3". it is warm and cozy with pockets, which i love. with the sleeves being short, i am wearing a long, frilly cardigan over it. i ordered the small (did not notice a size chart with this product). i am usually a size other or 6. it fits great in the bodice, but runs large through the hips. however,
other These pants have a very odd design but they are so soft and so comfortable i could not resist. going on a trip to key west and thought they would be great for the plane ride. they fit true to size. could not pass up as they were on sale.
3 It seems like most people love this tee, so you might as well. i returned it because i didn't like how the front hung. if the front was as long as the back, i would have kept it. or, if the front was short enough to wear with thick pants, untucked, i might have kept it (seems like this top would only look good with leggings or skirts). i do like the material, though. it's very thin and looks great in the shoulder and neck area. and i liked how the back of the shirt looked when i tried wearing it
3 The stylist had me try this top on off the shoulders, but that was kind of snug, perhaps why it didn't fit right, it is not off the shoulders on this picture. the cut is loose, so it looked big on me, but going smaller would not have worked the way i had it on... may give it another try on. xs was big, so would need to try the xxs next time. but off the shoulders looked nice on the lady who was smaller built next to me!colors are nice, light, but appropriate for fall (or summer!) light fabri
other Love this dress!  it's sooo pretty.  i happened to find it in a store, and i'm glad i did bc i never would have ordered it online bc it's petite.  i bought a petite and am 5'8".  i love the length on me- hits just a little below the knee.  would definitely be a true midi on someone who is truly petite.
other This top is very pretty. it's a bit more voluminous than the picture would let on, but otherwise as expected. you can adjust the ties at the shoulder.
other I ordered the green top in store after trying on a medium that was huge. the small fits me well and i love the flowy style and softness of the fabric. i like it with skinny capri jeans and the color will transition well into fall. i'm in florida where it is still very hot in october. if you typically wear either a small or medium, order the small in this top.
other I purchased this sweater in the grey color and loved it so much i decided to buy it in purple as well. however, when i received it, the color was much much darker than pictured and even looked black sometimes. decided to return :/
other I saw this jacket on the sale rack at my local store but the size was extra small, and needed a medium. the store was able to order since it showed back order . i do miss the charge send option, but still love retailer! normally i wear a medium in this brand. i received my order today and it's a beautiful jacket however there's a few things that could have been done in the manufacture that would've improved it. one, the jacket is not lined and it would be beneficial if the jacket was lined or even
other This dress is very flattering and well made. i can hardly wait to wear it. it's one of my favorite retailer purchases.
other This top is really pretty, however i found it to be super small. i know meadow rue tends to run small, but this small was like an extra small. i'm not large chested either . if you are super straight/thin with a long torso this is the top for you.
other The quality of this sweater is excellent. it is well work the money. i am 34d 5'4" and purchased a medium. fits perfectly for a fitted look and hits right at my natural waistline.
other I purchased this top in the taupe color, and it is much prettier in person than it photographs online. it runs about a half size too large, and sits slightly off the shoulders. fun casual top for the fall.
3 Love the design and style of this dress when i saw it online, however, it falls a little short once in person. it was a bit boxier than i wanted and the lines didn't make it appear as a swing dress, highlighting your figure.i wish this could have worked, however, it felt a little too unshapely.
other This is cuter in person, more of a brown than a cream like in the picture. it runs a little smaller than i was expecting, but that's actually good for me as things usually are a little loose up top. i'm 5'6", 120 lbs, 32c, and an xs fit well for a sexier look, but if you're wanting it a little looser, i would go up one size.
other The bikini bottoms are high quality and feel very luxurious. order one size up. this line runs small. i read the reviews and ordered a medium. i am normally xs/s in underwear but the medium fits me perfectly. i wish i had ordered in other colors before they sold out! trust me you'll want another pair after trying these on.
other After missing out on last year's similar dress, i am so glad i finally purchased this one! it is beautiful in person. i bought to wear to a wedding, but i am curious if others think it might be too white? i bought the peach color. i will keep this dress no matter what. hope they come out with more next season!
other I bought this dress in the orange and it is great for summer. even though i am normally a small/size other at 5'5" & 118 lbs, i opted for the 6 because i am busty (34d). this was the right call. the dress is comfortable, flattering and i got lots of compliments. it's a keeper!
other Loved the design and quality of this suit but the cups seemed huge. i weight 135lbs 5'6" and wear a 34c. i bought a large in this suit because other reviews said it ran small (normally i wear a size medium) i did like how it fit everywhere expect the chest. i'm wondering if the medium will still be too large in the chest and hoping the rest would still fit okay. not sure i want to go through the hassle to exchange and it not fit again! it's so cute otherwise and would be perfect if you have a la
3 Ordered this online in the pinkish color. the material is a little thin. as a busty, curvy lady this one just didn't sit right, ran a tad large, and looked boxy. if you have a thinner frame, may be a better look for you. detailing is nice.
other I saw this dress in the window at the roc center nyc store and knew i had to have it. the one i chose has muted earth-tone colors of tan, green, gold. looks stunning with my complexion. the blue one was nice too, but the earth tones were more flattering on me.  the fit is loose and flowy, very comfortable, but not baggy. i'm 5'5, 34c, 115ish and i took my usual xs. i plan to pair it with a muted green leather jacket and brown boots for the fall. can't wait!
other The blue dress is lovely, fit true to size and a good all around, comfy dress.
other I normally don't care for rayon clothing but the fabric feels nice and it is flattering in the way it fits. i got my usual medium and it fits well. it has a nice drape and is not see through.
3 I was under the impression that the blouse is lined however i'd need to buy yet another tank to go underneath which may be an issue due to how short this blouse is. i returned it.
other This skirt is much more vivid in person, which i like. the fit though was off for me. i ordered my usual size medium. i wear a 6 or 8 in bottoms. the medium was fitted!! you could see every curve. definitely not comfortable with that! i would probably have a better fit with a size up, however, i am not a fan of the gray lining that you can see on the inner back portion of skirt... so i think i will pass on this one.
other I'm so in love with this skirt. i sized up to a other (i'm typically a other in maeve) and it's pure perfection. i had to steam it after getting home from the store because it wrinkled up pretty quickly. wore it with my copper birks and a chambray top but i can see this being dressed up for work as well. took off a star due to his easily it wrinkled.
other These pants are so comfy i'm getting a second pair. i ordered the olive color in a small/reg, im thinking of ordering the xs next time since they do stretch out a great deal as the day goes on. would definitely recommend these for sure. hope this review is helpful as i struggled with ordering petite or not. glad i didn't!
other Just note the pink is different than in the photos. much hotter/more saturated. apart from that surprise, overall i'd recommend. nice design.
3 This was very tight in the bust in my typical size. it fit more or less everywhere else, but the material has no give. so unless you are the precise measurements of the dress, this will be a hard dress to wear.the color is really lovely though!
other I was drawn to this top because of the interesting and detailed straps, which are embroidered with a lovely triangle pattern. however the embroidery takes away any stretchy-ness or give in the cotton and makes the top a beautiful but ill-fitting harness for anyone with any breasts or full-figured lusciousness. the worst part is that the top hem along the top is embroidered and rigid just like the straps, so it feels like you are wearing an uncomfortable strapless top. i wanted to keep this but h
other Purchased this dress at the sale price, with an additional 20% off sale, not exactly sure what to expect-- the print is so different than my usual style preference. so glad i did! while the dress is way oversized (for reference, i'm 5'4, 13other lbs) ordered size sm but prob should have gone with xs) it's stylish, yet effortless. today is the first day of wear (at my office) and already received many complements.
other I ordered this online which is always a gamble when it comes to fit. i was pleasantly surprised. color is true white and lace is not flimsy which i appreciate. good coverage of the girls so i don't have to layer over a tank. also arm holes don't gap and they're not too tight. beautiful with trousers, jeans or a skirt. i've already worn it twice to work. i know i'll be wearing it a lot. fit seems true to size. i usually order a medium and i ordered a medium which fits me perfectly.
other Love this! i am 5' 118 and the medium fits like a dress, not a tunic. i opted for the medium because i didn't want the fit to be tight. it is thin so you'll need a slip.
3 This is an oversized tee with a somewhat flattering fit. material is very thin. i ordered white, which was completely see-through. not at all what i was expecting. might work better in a darker color, but i returned it since it was nothing special.
other Pilcro from retailer is a great alternative to the premium denim lines with a way better price point! similar cut & quality with awesome rises and spandex/stretch content! also, the styles are always on trend!
other Beautiful! soft, flattering but not clingy~ i bought in the green which is not a typical color in the summer palate which makes it all the more appealing.
other I love these pants - the color is great, the style is comfortable and easy but can be dressed up. like other reviewers, i washed these according to the care instructions and they shrunk horribly. however - after some googling, i was able to find a fix. soak the pants for 5-10 minutes in warm water mixed with 3-other tsp hair conditioner. gently wring them out and start to (gently) stretch the fabric as much as possible. hang on a drying rack and continue to gently stretch the fabric as the pants dry
other This dress is gorgeous. the quality is high, runs true to size, and is very flattering! my only issue is the tule. i already have hips, so the tule makes the dress over-flare. i am going to have the tailor remove the tule and it will be perfect. for those who are not an hourglass shape naturally, this will help provide the extra shaping.overall, i love this dress and will be keeping it.
other Beautiful color and the fabric is very substantial and soft. but, they didn't finish the bottom hem! the dress is lined and the bottom inside has a ribbon sewn in as a type of hem, but the actual edge is just cut and not turned in on itself. because of this the whole bottom had a hundred little fabric frays. the rest of the dress is so polished it just doesn't make sense. also, while the fabric is beautiful my dress had a weird mark on the chest, almost like a water mark. just overall bad attent
other I just picked this up in store the other day! i absolutely love it! it is so easy to throw on real quick for a cute outfit.
other It's a great addition for summer. defiantly need a tank on under it but very pretty.
other This top is the epitome of late summer and getting into fall mood. it's soft fabric falls nicely on top of skinny jeans. the open shoulders are trendy and flattering!
other This romper is really cute. it's flowy and wide at the middle, which i like. it's comfortable. i ordered my usual size small and it was too big. i'm hoping an exchange will do the trick .
other Such pretty pattern and colors, pleased with dress
3 I saw this dress online and immediately fell in love with the bow design. purchased my typical size other but found it way too tight. i went to my local retailer to exchange it for the size 6. unfortunately, even the size 6 just did not fit right. moving around in the dress was challenging; the slightest shoulder/arm movement made the dress ride up. i was constantly pulling it down. the fabric is also quite stiff and heavy. overall, it's a cute dress but just not for me.
other I like the color of this dress, but its a little thin for fall. on me, the neckline is more round and the sleeves a little cappier. i have dresses in this brand in both a size small and medium. i went with a small in this dress. returning it for a medium.
other I ordered the 00 p after trying on the regular 0, and that was better. it runs wide, the lining is true to size, but the overlay is loose. the colors are pretty, the design is nice, but i didn't love it as much as other ones.likes: the studs add an edgier look to a almost dainty look (flow y sheer fabric). the cut is flattering if you get the right size (recommend one size down).no big dislikes...why i would still recommend.11other lbs, 30dd chest, 26.other in waist... 00p
other Love, love, love. i have both colors and wear with leggings. it's not a heavy sweater and has a great drape, super flattering. i'm usually a medium and it runs true to size - not supposed to be tight. i find it a little low in the front,but a tank underneath takes of it. washes well.
other Pretty design and good quality but the medium was very balloony at the bottom. fit my chest alright (34c) but flared out way too much at the bottom.
other This dress was absolutely beautiful in person, but it didn't end up working out for me. i wear a 10, the 10 fit, but i have a 34g chest and because of that the waistline didn't sit low enough - it was just below my bust instead of at my natural waist. i really wanted this to work and think it would be great for the right person. seemed tts. love the detailing!
other This dress is absolutely lovely. i couldn't leave the store without it, even though it was full price and i have a million dresses. it's just that great. i am 5' 8" 130 lbs and bought the small
other Purchased this sweater in pink which is a beautiful blend of grey and pink. i purchased my usual size xs and it fits great through the shoulders, sleeves and body. i did try on a s and the body was too boxy. also, i tried a couple of different ones in my xs (along with other colors) and found them to run a little differently so you may want to check this out. the sweater is beautiful and easy to wear. the zipper adds a unique detail which can be unzipped part way to show a tank or just to draw a
other I wanted to love this dress.....the reviews were great, the price was right and i needed a simple black dress. the fabric (jersey) is lovely and drapes nicely and the print was pretty. unfortunately, the armholes were way too long and low for me and even with a black bra, i was sharing more of my lingerie than i wanted. perhaps someone with a slightly smaller chest could size down and avoid oversharing!for reference, i am 5'5", 14other and wear a 30gg bra. i ordered the m.
other This skirt is very comfortable and moves well. i'm 5'4" and ordered a 2p, which fits perfectly. the length hits just above the top of my feet. the patterned chiffon is sheer and the skirt has a short black slip underneath that ends just above my knees. i have a small waist and wider hips, but found the inner slip to fit loosely enough so that it doesn't ride up when i walk or sit. the two slits on either side were a great length and make this skirt both flirty and quirky. you'll get tons of comp
other I was looking for a flannel-y buttondown that i could wear with leggings or skinny jeans, and this definitely fits the bill. i like the cute details like the contrast collar and cuffs, and also the slight back pleat and the curved hemline. i'm not crazy about the colorways that are offered, but the pink is cute enough, and as other reviewers mentioned, i find the quality a little lacking. i'd be very happy with this shirt on sale, but not sure about it at full price. i got a size s (5'4", 120 lb
other 1.) if you look at the 4th photo of the grey shirt and zoom in you can get an accurate view of the back: this shirt is attached in not one, but two places in the back (in the photos of the black shirt it looks like it is only attached, or "knotted" in one place, and that is not the case). disappointing. ----------2.) unless you want to wear this as an off-the-shoulder shirt with a strapless bra size down. caveat: sizing down will become problematic though for those with large arms as the sle
3 Well, this top just did not do anything for me - it's a very conservative style with the high neckline and blousy fit. you'd need to go a little lower in size if you want any of your figure to show through. i guess it might be good for a church function or some other conservative event, but it was too buttoned-up for my style. i also had a hard time getting it off even though the size i tried on was large for me. i didn't care for the feel of the fabric either, although the lace is nice.
other These are darling. love flannel and pattern which is very upbeat. wish they were a little more pegged/slim/tapered at the bottoms.
other Cute tee shirt but it runs very large.i ordered a small and probably an xxs would have fit.unfortunately i have to return it.for reference i am 5'3" and 110 lbs.
other I walked right by this dress until an associate of mine asked me to try it on. i am so glad she did. this dress is far more flattering on me then i expected and it has pockets! after assessing it further, i decided i liked the material it is lined and will not make you look like a wrinkled up paper bag after sitting down. i bought a small, i compared the medium and both would work on my frame because of the tie waist. i am 5ft 3" 137 lbs 36b chest and i have a proportionate athletic figure. for
other I tried it in the store but was not the true size so i ordered online. i wore it only once so far and got lots of compliments. very unique design.
other Great shirt, more of a stretch to it than i thought it would. very flowy, looks great with jeans & leggings.
other Based on other reviews, i ordered these trousers in my regular size 8 (dark grey) and up one size10 (black motif). the size 8 fit perfectly; and the size 10 are too big (returning). i am not sure what the other reviewers experienced, but size 8 in this brand fits, regardless of style. i also prefer the solid grey, but that is just a personal choice. i felt the black motif trousers looked like pajama bottoms.
other Love! i am 5'3" 118lbs with short legs and a long torso. i was worried these would be too long....they fit to perfection! super excited about this purchase
other Really, this top feels like a wonderfully expensive soft silk knit. it is just so very soft. the drape is really nice and there is stretch to it, making it very comfortable. it does have a tendency to fall towards the body, even though it's loose. so, i'd buy your regular size.it's a thin material, but i don't think it's sheer at all. i bought the dark red/wine color and it's so classy! i love it. this will fit taller women easily because the arms and total length are on the long side (i sup
other I really like this shirt. the material was a little heavier cotton than i expected in looking at the picture which is good otherwise it could look like you slept in the shirt. it is something that is going to wrinkle when you wear it so if that is bothersome then pass on this shirt. it's a bit longer which i also like because it will work by itself or under a jacket or sweater.
other Comfortable and cute. versatile colors that can be worn with virtually anything.
other It fits great. it is super comfortable. have gotten many compliments on how this skirt looks on me!
3 The fabric was more "southwestern" looking when i got it than it looked in the pics. it fit a bit larger around the bottom than i like.
other These pants overall are very comfortable, but have an unusual fit. they tend to run a bit short, and i always have to get pants hemmed shorter, so if you have long legs or like more draping, you probably won't like these. they also ran a bit large in the waist and thigh, a bit puffy, i had to size down in order to get a good fit. very good quality, and cute design.
other This is a great throw on and go dress. it would work great with a sweater and tights or by itself in the hottest of weather. it looks a lot less awkward on than the picture online indicates.
other This dress was so comfortable, i wore it all day - to church, out to brunch and actually slept in it. it would travel well, too.
other This dress is not flattering. the slip is very small and short and the dress is big and billowy. like the other reviewer said, its more like a tablecloth that you stick your head through. it was really hard to figure out how to cinch in the waist but it didn't help regardless. the length is not accurate either. i would say it's a pretty short dress (mid thigh) but that probably depends on the person. it also makes you look very horizontal. i was really excited about this dress but it's getting r
other I got the purple and its a lovely muted purple, almost lavender. nice quality, flattering. i recently had a baby so this is a nice shirt to hide my wobbly bits. i'd recommend to anyone (with or without wobbly bits).
other This is the most comfortable, sweet, beautiful, romantic and timeless dress. i bought the green motif one is sz 1other and it fits perfectly. i am smaller chested (usually a 12/medium/large up top depending on the item) and a sz 14/xl/33 for pants so perhaps this dress runs one size small? the color in the detail shot is most accurate - it's bright & cheerful and dreamy.
other This looks great on the model but when it arrived, i couldn't believe it was the same jacket. it looks a bit like a really loose garbage bag on me and no amount of adjusting drawstrings is going to fix it. i really wanted to like it, but even the xs/s was too baggy. also a bit worried based on other reviews that it isn't actually a rain jacket and wont keep you dry.
other This is like wearing an afghan, but i get cold really easy so for me that's a good thing. and it's super soft and not itchy. i could easily never take this off. runs a little large, but that should be fine when it gets layered. ...only thing i didn't like was the one long stitch that holds the wrap in place. i worry it will snap and the whole thing will unravel.
other I'm petite, but even if i weren't, i think this runs very large, isn't form flattering at all, and overall looks dull. it most definitely does not justify the price. material is thin.
other I am normally a size 4/6p in all things retailer but read the reviews and opted to go petite on the maxi and size up. i went with the 8p and even with a 32d bust, had no trouble zipping and it fit beautifully. the band is a tad loose, but any tighter wouldn't have fit in the bust. this dress hangs beautifully and is incredibly flattering, especially for those of us with an athletic build.
other I saw this shirt online, loved it, but unfortunately it was sold out in the regular size small. however, retailer shirts tend to be long on me, so i ordered a petite small. it fits great! i am actually happy i got a petite because i feel a regular would have been too long. the shirt comes to my hips. for reference i'm 5'8" 14other lbs. and my measurements are 34-27-38.
other This 'poor boy' mock t-neck/high crew neck top looks a tiny bit more olive to me than the online photos. the fit runs on the smaller size, and the sleeves will be bracelet length or 3/other length for taller women..i tried a size xs that was in the store and it fit with the sleeves just above my wrists, but a size s would have been fine too (i'm 5'2", currently 33-25-37, narrow shoulders and torso).for reference, even the size m of the short sleeve version fit fine, so there is a lot of give..no
other The fit was not flattering at all, but the worst part was the colors were really dull and not bright as shown in the online photos.
other I purchased the green in xs and it fits perfect. it's very flattering. also, i purchased the blue in xxsp (only size available), but it was too short.
other I actually had no problem with the neck hole of this shirt, even with the xs size. however, i had a huge issue with the bottom eyelet section. it's so tight! it stretches across my thighs and looks so funny, as the top part is still loose. i tried moving up to a size small and still had this problem. maybe just not for girls with thighs ... very strange fit.
other I'm 5'5" 127lbs. ordered size small. not sheer. bodysuit snaps. great to wear with skirts and wide leg pants!!
other This shirt is much more flattering in person. if i hadn't seen it in store, i don't think it would have caught my eye. i like the mix of casual and dressy this top has (i got it specifically for teaching). the one thing i noticed, however, was that the first xs i tried on looked very big on me. i tried a second on and the fit was much more flattering! i highly recommend that you try on the specific blouse you plan to purchase before you actually buy it. i'm glad i tried a second on, because i th
other This top is great. it hangs in the perfect way to hide imperfections. the orange/red is a great accent and i received compliments when i wore it.
other Super comfortable top. easily washable, other options with the sleeves, and a nice drape to the fabric. truly a go-anywhere top.
other Super cute and flow. mine had a bit of stitching problem so i am exchanging it for the same thing. fabric feels great. def recommend
other This dress is magical. i wore it to a christmas party and felt like the belle of the ball. my dress swirled around me as i spun on the dance floor. later, i spilled a tequila-ginger all over the front. i was devastated, but it almost instantly dried and there are no stains!!! you can't even tell i spilled! it is hand-washable, which is great as well! i am 4'1other and 100lbs. the xxsp fit like a glove.highly recommend! any other dress would have been ruined but this one was literally magical.
other These pants pair well with anything - dress up or down, boots or sandals....but beware, they run big and rear end stretches out when sitting at work all day. if you have a booty these pants will be perfect buy one size down tho. if you have a flat rear like me, then buy two sizes down. length is good to leave uncured, just above ankle or roll up to perfect height. great color - fabric is amazing.
other I bought the white version of this beautiful top in the store yesterday, this romantic top is beautifully detailed, very soft, comfortable and flattering. there is a thin cotton liner underneath too. fits true to size with enough room in the bust to not be too tight.
other I got this vest on sale in the navy color and love it! the quality of the fabric is great and the draped design of it is so chic! really adds a stylish touch to almost any outfit.
3 I so wanted to love this dress! the fabric is gorgeous the styling beautiful and the construction is great - however, the armholes are cut too generously. i am 5'4", 138 pounds and 36d. i ordered the black in a size 10. it fit me perfectly everywhere but the armholes. even with an undergarment, too much is exposed. i am sadly returning this.
other I can't think of many things more comfortable than cloth & stone's fabric, so when i saw this jumpsuit i had to try it. it is a nice mid-weight perfect for fall weather or a mild winter like we are currently having in the northeast! looks very cute with a duster cardigan over it. fits true to size (meant to fit a little loosely). length is great everywhere on my 5'7" frame. feels like wearing pajamas, with the benefit of looking put-together!
other I loved the cut of these pants and the button accent on the pockets. however, the material was quite thin and the quality was not great- there were multiple snags along the seams. additionally, at 5'8, 130lbs i was swimming in the size 4. i would have tried sizing down if the quality was better.
other I love the raw edges on this t-shirt and the marled pink is a pretty color. the fit is not as oversized as you might expect from the photos. order your usual size. it's very soft and lightweight.
other I love this top. the material is soft but good quality and not flimsy. the cut is fitted and flattering. the color of the fabric is ivory, not bright white. the embroidery is a good quality and doesn't easily fray. the fit is true to size. i highly recommend this top. i wear it with jeans and it looks really cute, always get compliments. it's very comfortable too.
3 This top is adorable in style and fit. which is why it breaks my heart that i can't recommend it. the embroidery snags so easily, when i wore it, i ended up with several tears in the threads, leaving the pattern a bit of a mess. it snagged on my rings, my watch and my purse. i returned it because of this. it's really too bad, and i wish the design were printed on instead of sewn, simply because it would last a lot longer.
other I have had a hard time finding shorts as i have a smaller waist and bigger thighs. i am other ft other and weigh 12other lbs and i wear a size 25/26 in jeans i bought a size 26 in these and they fit great. i wouldn't size down if you have thighs as i like some room in mine.
other Swimsuit shopping can be the worst. it's difficult to find bathing suits that fit well and are flattering. this swim top is a winner. the straps are comfortable, and the scoop in the front was not too low for a 36d cup. the best part is the higher back! a lot of swimwear dips in the back, but this does not (read: eliminates the dreaded back fat). my only concern was that it isn't super supportive for larger busts, but i'm keeping it because i love the straps and how it flatters overall. this wou
other This sweater was cute and comfy and was true to size.
other Love the fabric. comfortable to wear with jeans or a dress. good for those cool fall mornings.
other This skirt was very figure flattering, and the elastic waist is comfortable and does not cut into my sides! has a great look
3 I really wanted to keep this dress, and the material is amazing, so soft and gentle and delicate, the design is great, the front looks nice, but from back looks really awkward, big and kind of too loose!
other Tried this on at my local retailer, the red color is pretty but not a "true" red. the fabric has a nice weight to it not the usual thin stuff that retailer seems to offer these days. two big problems though- the top is very low cut and i could see it "opening" up to the world! and the armholes are cut so big and low that you could see the sides of my bra, this is a deal-breaker for me, it can't be fixed.
3 This is one of those dresses that might be better for those under 40. on me, the fullness of the pleats and the bell sleeve made me feel like i was wearing one of those dresses for a much older lady. i miss not having to consider those things. the red color is lovely and the dress is modest. i just think it will read a lot better on a younger chiquita.
other Really liked the styling on this jumpsuit. it looks great on, the lattice back is unusual. i had been looking for a little black jumpsuit for the longest time and this fits the bill. just wish the fabric wasn't polyester. on the down side the top buttons are really hard to put on and take off. if you take care of your nails, it could do a number on them. the bottom buttons are easier. can only imagine a struggle when trying to take this off in an emergency bathroom break!
other This is such an adorable tee. the stripes and lace up details are super cute and on trend. i usually take a xxs and that is what i took in this tee. i tried the xs and at 5"other and 10other pounds it looked a bit loose and long on me. love this tee and highly recommend this one!
other I was unsure about the color when i got it in the mail but it is very flattering. it is roomy for sure. with a pair of slim shorts or pants it looks great though. creasing may be an issue. 5ft 6, 13other lbs 36 d...the xs looks good with room to spare.nice weight fabric for fall.
3 I found both colors and jumped on this shirt. then i got it home and realized that it was pretty much useless. there is no way to put a sweater or jacket over it, it is too hot to wear in the summer, putting a tee under ruins the look.i am very flat chested so it hung well, but there is lots of shirt. both went back in exchange for two wearable items.
other Love the lilac purple color, breathable yet not see through material is soft on your skin. i like the small detail cut out in the back, and a high bonus point for not showing your bra. one minor thing i would change is the length of the string in the back, but not a big deal.
other I saw this dress in the store tried it on and , love! it is so hard to find a white dress that is not too fancy or frilly. this dress fits great and flatters my full figure (size 1other to 14), plus it has pockets! the woven material with the big fun flowers is accented by the plain band at the bottom which falls just above the knee. the center of the flower adds a nice three dimensional touch. i brought it in a large and i will wear this lovely feminine flirty beauty all spring and summer. from fun
other I love this dress so much. it is more comfortable than any of my pajamas and the best part is it is very work appropriate, especially paired with chambray shirt buttoned and then tied at the waist.
other I have a pair of mih jeans that are the only jeans i own that i absolutely love. everything about them. this jumper looked versatile, useful and fun, so i splurged during the 25% off dress sale.my experience with mih is that the sizing runs true, or european, and thus small. i ordered this in a medium and it is gargantuan as well as virtually shapeless. it looked horrible from every angle: front, back and sides. i cannot imagine it having more fit even in a smaller size.the fabric is nice, p
other I'm so glad i tried these on at one of my local retailer stores. i didn't really think much of it online but they have a much nicer look and cut in person. i got the navy blue in size 27 which fit tts. i got a regular size vs. the petite size which i usually like to go with because i'm short but i actually found that they fell very similar to the model's length shown online. they seem so versatile, i'm looking forward to wearing these!
other I bought this in the store and it is beautiful, the red is more of a faded red/burnt orange, not as bright as pictured, which is great. i am usually an xs or s and was a s in this item.
other I give this sweater a five star review. i am always thrilled to be able to add a cardigan or caccoon sweater that is a color that is different than black or white.this pairs beautifully with so many of the shells and sleeveless shirts that i have from retailer.yes this sweater is extremely delicate, it didn't pull at all while i was trying it on. this will be a great transition sweater.
other This dress is comfortable and stylish at the same time. it runs true to size. i'm 5'1" 113 lbs and got the xs petite. wore it once so far for a few hours and got a few compliments on it!
other This is a beautiful, flattering top that looks great on its own or layered under kimonos or jackets. i bought it in wine and black.
other I love this shirt! the pictures do not do it justice. intricate detail. lovely.
other This gem is beyond lovely! i saw this other years ago and regretted not buying it other years ago and then i was looking on here as i do on a weekly basis and bam it was there, i gasped hahahaha but really this is an amazing statement piece. i am usually a l but got the m as it is a bit big and its your preference on how you want to wear it. i will be wearing this to death for autumn winter and forever its just one of those. soft and not itchy and i have sensitive skin.
other I love this tunic! perfect for the beach or by the pool! gorgeous design and even better in person! light weight, i am usually a small/medium and originally bought the small but ended up returning for the medium so i had a little more room up top for wearing over my swimsuit.
3 The styling of this top is really cute. it fits perfectly on the shoulders and gets bigger at the hem for the baby doll look. my biggest complaint is the quality! it's really cheap and feels like the quality i would expect to see at a cheap retailer. it catches lint like crazy and because the hem is just a pearl edge, it curls really badly. i buy quite a bit from here and this is the worst quality item i have seen in a long time. not worth the $$ if paying full price.
other This shirt totally exceeded my expectations -- the detail and colors are wonderful, and the shirt itself is quite comfortable. the shirt is a bit boxy, but there is enough structure and detail so that it looks quite flattering on. plus, it looks great with jeans or with a skirt -- it is very easy to style!
3 If you have any curves at all then this will look like a sack on you. i wanted to love it because of the material and i've been looking for a blazer/ jacket that was heavy in weight. this just looked awful on me. maybe for someone who is very slender this will work but i was highly disappointed in the cut.
other Great fit, easy to dress up or down, lovely shade of blue--this will be my default dress this summer.
3 Loved the shorts version of these so ordered the pants but not quite the right fit for my legs. no fault of the pants just too skinny in the legs.
other I received this skirt today and am absolutely thrilled! as a short and curvy lady, i feel most comfortable in fuller skirts (but not too poofy), and this one lies perfectly (does not make my hips look wide!). the colors are soft and very feminine, which also suits my style. it may seem like a springtime skirt, but i will start wearing it with tights and a sweater right away.
other The color is as pictured, like a deep coral. very comfy and great drape.
other Lots of embellishment, striking magenta color, feels great on, with a flattering neckline that isn't too low. i recommend it!
other This jumpsuit is great dressed up or down. the only issue i had with it is that the straps are very long (but that was an easy fix).
3 This shirt is tough for me because i loved the front, which fit nicely, but i'm petite and the back had a giant extra piece of fabric that bumped out because of the cross straps, i wish it wasn't so wide so i could have bought it!
3 Not sure why this dress was once backordered? if you have a big chested basically falls from your chest straight down and gives you know figure. disappointing. i will be returning it. not meant for big chested fit woman.
other Very flatttering skirt ! super cute ! highly recommend !
other Love the pattern, i thought i would be hosed and need a petite, but the regular xs fits nicely. it is on the thiner side, so great for summer (office is cooold)love subtle squares, glad they still had my size at sale! :-)
other This shirt is very soft and fits nicely. as with a lot of maeve tops, the arms are a little snug so if you have muscular arms you'll definitely want to size up. it won't make the shirt too "blousey" because it will still look really cute tucked in in the front with ankle jeans and a trendy belt. i wish i had gotten this in the blue before it sold out because it is lovely!
other The fitted top and flared skirt are really nice on this piece. i am 5'6" 125lb and i took a 6. a other might have been ok, but i felt more comfortable in the 6, and it had a really nice fit.the quality is good, but there were some areas that were starting to pull and the floral details come a little frayed around the cutout edges, so i'm not sure how it will wear.
other I love that his blazer is soft and not so structured. so great for a business casual environment. the gray goes with everything and is already a staple in my wardrobe.
other I love the colors, and saw the xxs p in a store, so tried it on, but sadly, that was still a lot of fabric on me. i think if you have very small thin arms, that may work, but with muscles, it just made me look bigger than i am... the design (pattern) is really nice though. 11other lbs, 30 dd flat
other I ordered this dress on a whim in my normal size 8 and if fits perfectly! i felt so pretty when i put it on. i love the volume of the skirt with the tighter top. it was very flattering to me. the linen thickness was nice but not for summer in florida maybe spring. but its lovely!
other I bought the mauve color and it's very pretty. i felt as though sizing up was a better choice. i'm usually an xs or a small and i went with the small. i liked the length of the small better. the shoulders add a cute look to it.
other The fabric is soft and the wine color is rich and a good alternative for black. i love it so much and bought the grey one as well. you can wear it open or button up like on the model. great layering pieces. i am 5'3, 120lbs, 34dd bra and take this in size small.
other I was in search of a few sweaters that were functional for the winter, but also fit my style. i will have to wear a camisole underneath, but i love the feel and the fit! i always have a problem finding sleeves that are long enough. the sleeves are an appropriate length.
other This is the most beautiful bathing suit ive ever owned. it is so unique and comfortable. the fit and everything is just amazing. so happy with this purchase.
other I stumbled across this dress at the store and fell in love. it's so bright and cheery but still sophisticated enough for most events. i love that the tulle that gives the skirt a slight flare and body is completely concealed. the dress is well lined and darling. i am small chested so i didn't have an issue with it feeling revealing nor did the lining hang out. i purchased this for my rehearsal and rehearsal dinner for my summer wedding. i look forward to wearing the dress many times after.
other I agree that this shirt is boxy and has no shape; it doesn't look at all like it does on the model. i returned it.
other I bought this tunic for my mom as a birthday gift. it is very good quality and will look cute for fall too.
3 Lightweight, airy silk. it's not shown in the photos but it has a half slip which is too noticeable through the thin silk. it looks somewhat cheap. the silk doesn't feel smooth to the touch. it has a slight roughness to it. it would have been nicer if they had used thicker, higher quality silk. the waist has a tight, wide, elastic band which after wearing for awhile feels uncomfortable. the color of the skirt is true to the photos. i wanted to love this skirt but i will be returning it.
other I got these pretty boy shorts because i was looking for a panty that was comfy for bedtime--pretty but with a fair amount of coverage. i am really happy with them. wonderful with a tank top or chemise. i think the ruffles are a bit bulky for skinny jeans, but i love them for sleeping. they feel special.
other These pants are so soft and so comfortable! i was absolutely in love at first sight. however, i got the petite, because i am 5'3, and they were still a little longer than i like my pants to be. i wanted them to hit right above the ankle, just like the photo, however, they are a tad longer. i still love them and they are still as comfy as ever, so i am gonna deal with the length!!
other I grabbed this pair of pj pants on sale, and i'm glad i did. the material is soft and lightweight-- ideal for summer,. they fit loose but true to size for a standard pair of pj pants.
other I bought this in blue and can't wait to wear it, feels so soft. exactly like the picture.
3 Lovely palette and and fabric but the cut did not flatter my shape. the flowy cut broadened my silhouette and hit at my waist making me look bigger than i actually am. the overall effect was quite frumpy in spite of the flamboyant pattern. perhaps a better choice for someone built exactly like the model.i will be returning it.
other Love this sweater! it's really flattering, long and lean, though not tight, just the right amount of shape and length for my size. i run between and 8 and a 10, and i'm about 5'8", i ordered the medium. i love the contrasting knits of the sleeves and body of the sweater. i only wish it came in more colors, i'd order it again!
other I am so happy with this jumpsuit! it is the perfect comfortable and casual summer outfit. the fabric is super soft. i was unsure about the length at first because it's shorter than my other jumpsuits, but if you scrunch up the bottom of the legs and add some sandals, it's a great look. highly recommend!
other This will be a great summer staple.  good fit and very comfortable.  may go back and buy another color
other Hahaha! as gorgeous as this piece is, i look absolutely ridiculous in it. i am 5'7'' 11other lbs but have a long torso and so the crotch area is, well, a little unflattering to say the least:) i am really sad because i shy away from shorts due to my year round pale skin, but this fabric and color worked really well for me. the length of the shorts is also nice and the back is beautiful! i've never had a romper and i was truly hoping this one would be the one for me. it is all round perfect...if you
other I had been eyeing this coat for a few weeks after it appeared in the email, and i finally decided to purchase it to treat myself. i was very excited to get it, as it is a beautiful coat online. however, once i received it i was very disappointed. the material is much thinner than i would expect for something that cost $168, and when i went to button it the button slipped right off the thread it was sewn onto the coat with. i checked the other buttons and all of them were loose as well. perso
other I love the cut and fit of this t. it's soft and has just enough flow to be comfortable without being unflattering. the gray floral print is very pretty. it's perfect with jeans or shorts in the summer.
3 I love belted sweaters, but this was way too low in front. it hung almost to my knees in front. i'm not a fan of that look.
other I really like this shirt, and have gotten plenty of compliments the first time i've worn it.
other I absolutely love these pants! i have been searching for a pair of linen pants for quite a few years but have never really found a pair that looked good on me until now. i have usually found linen pants to lack shape and end up making me look frumpy but i really love the fabric. well, these pants actually have some structure to them and are still super comfy and soft. i bought the neutral color which is acutually a very fine tan and white pinstripe which makes the pants a bit more classy. i love
other I just received this shirt in the mail, and i'm in love. it isn't your average t-shirt in that it has character and class. i can't wait to wear it! another reviewer was unhappy that the embroidery in blue on the back wasn't as dramatic as the picture; i'm not seeing it. i think the blue stands out very well. i know i should say, "hurry and get yours before they're gone," but in truth, i'd rather be the only one with this beautiful shirt! :)
other I tried these on in the store and was unsure about sizing. once they went on sale i bought the xs and have already worn them twice.good transitional grey colored short into fall. need to be ironed or steamed after wearing for a while but comfy and smooth out easily.
other For a brand called "tiny"--this dress was really big. i ordered my usual m and it was like a sack--virtually no shape to it at all. i haven't been a small in many decades, so i'm really hesitant to order it again. i'm afraid i'll be like goldilocks--"too big!", "too small!"--but i'm probably going to give it a whirl because the green print is so pretty, and i l like that it has sleeves to protect from sun. and pockets! lots of good qualities, just putting them together in a wearable size seems t
other I took a chance on this in green, extra small (one size smaller than my normal size) because that was all that was left and i thought i could wear it under another sweater. no, it's too awesome to waste as a liner. it's the most amazing cut and fabric. it so flattering and so soft.please bring back this top!!!!
other Loved the color and the deshn. but when i put on, did not look right. waist was too short and the arms were long.
other Very well made dress but runs extremely small! definitely size up!
other I am 125lbs and purchased the petiite small. the dress is very flattering and can easily be dressed up or down. the fabric is a medium weight and does not cling to trouble areas.
other Love cloth and stone. this dress looks and fits exactly as pictured. soft and casual, with great design details.
other I received this top by mail yesterday and opened it this morning. all i can say is wow. it's gorgeous. the detailing is stunning, classic retailer amazing. a true standout piece. can't wait to wear.
other Love this top. fits true to size. not to boxy,, sleeves are so cute! looks very rich. a must have in your wardrobe!
other The color is more like bluish-green, very elegant! it's very soft and feels great on skin. i love the buttons on the back, it's such a great touch and brings this sweater to a whole new level. i usually wear xs but because i'm going to wear this sweater with a button up shirt underneath, i ordered s. great investment! love to have it in my closet.
3 I wanted to love this, as it seemed like a fun and carefree take on a little black dress.but how did i not see that this has tassels? but they're there, a whole row of them - look hear the bottom of the skirt part, between the colorful stripes and the lacy area. that's a deal breaker for me - i really can't stand the way these look, and they're not the sort of thing you can easily remove.the fabric, though nice quality, has no stretch at all. i wasn't expecting stretch, but i'd just say
other This dress is so comfortable, and i love the unique faux leather skirt and lace design. it really adds a special touch to the dress. i only gave it four stars because the top half is pretty boring...i wish the neckline wasn't so matronly. i'll definitely need a bib necklace or scarf to dress it up. i'm 5'5" and 11other and ordered the xs. i wish the dress cut in a little more at the sides to accentuate an hourglass figure, also. my husband loved it.
other I'm 5' 3", 11other pounds, and bought the xs in white. i actually wear this as a bathing suit cover-up instead of a top. i love that it's little longer in the back so it covers part of the back of my thighs. it's light weight, cool and comfortable. it is thin but has washed well with no pilling or holes so far. i've worn this several times and have had lots of compliments.
other Great colors, style and fit
other When i received this dress in the mail, i was thrilled. i loved the color and the style, although a bit too much material but comfortable. when i went to show my husband the dress, his first comment was very sexy. i can see your underwear and your skin!!! i don't understand why no one mentioned this in any of the comments on this dress. when i went into the light i saw that the dress was see through and i sadly had to return it.
other If you love the print then this is the dress for you. it is so incredibly flattering for hour-glass shapes. and it has pockets! i wanted to keep it but i just did not like the pattern and every guy i showed it to hated the pattern. if they had it in a different color, i would buy it in every color. :)
other This is the ideal easy-breezy sweater to throw over leggings when you just feel like being comfy, cozy, but still stylish. i love it.
other I love this comfy top, and if it couldn't get any better, the pleated back makes it extra special! it is easy to thrown on and still feel put together. i purchased this top in the green and i'm absolutely enthralled by the rich color! i do agree that the quality of the pleats could be slightly better, however i believe it's up to par with the price point. i typically wear an xs/xsp and ultimately decided to go with a small for a more oversized tunic top look, but otherwise i'd go for your normal
other I fell in love with dress immediately! it runs small, but is very flattering, even if you have a little you want to hide. i went up other size. so comfy and beautiful! love!!
3 L space is frustrating. i wear a 0/other top but with 32d's i tried a large in this bikini top because from past experience with l space they run small. there's just zero support. the tie design helps secure the girls in place, but also flattens them out if you tie it tight enough so you don't spill out.
other Tried this on and loved it! chic, lightweight, warm, cute left as is and cuter belted. ended up letting a friend buy it since it was the last one but will be adding to my iso list for sure!
other Lovely, warm sweater. excellent quality, fits as shown on model
other I fell in love with this dress when i saw it. i love the colors and pattern. i've just been on the fence whether it complements my hippy frame. i'm a size 8/10 right now. i do like it with or without the tie for different effects. one concern is that the website says hand wash and the tag on the seam says dry clean only. i usually don't buy dry clean clothes, but might make an exception for this one.
other I really wanted to love this top but the other reviewers are spot on when they say it is too short and boxy. so, fresh out of the package, the ruffle hit me right at the widest part of my hips and when i raised my arms the shirt exposed my midriff. not cute. i really liked the quality though so i washed it on delicate and then tugged gently to stretch the length out and hung to dry. now, it's still a wee boxy, of course, but significantly longer and much cuter on me. so, i'm keeping. even thinki
3 I loved the color and lines of this jumpsuit, but found it to be far too short in the torso. (and about 8" too long in the leg, but that's a lot easier to fix.) i tried sizing up, but it still wasn't working for me. i'm only 5'7", and while i'm long-waisted i can usually make jumpsuits work. if you have a short torso and long legs, this is a beautiful option. otherwise, i can't recommend it.
other These are super comfortable. i love feeling like i'm wearing pajamas in public but being properly dressed, although i wear them around the house often, too. i don't regret spending this much money on these pants, it was worth it since i'm wearing them so much.
other I ordered this in size xl in ivory. it was a drab, poorly-made, too-small sweater. the knit material wasn't good quality and the overall fit didn't work. i liked the light red color and maybe if that had been in stock, then i would have overlooked the problems. but, there are better ivory retailer cardigans available. this was returned.
other I got this in a l, and probably i am a m. however, the waist pretty much fit, but the bodice was baggy in a really bizarre way. i don't think a human could actually be shaped a way that would fit properly in this dress. this dress is well suited for a woman with a very large bust, but a small waist.
other These are the perfect high-waisted skinny jeans. they fit tts and don't stretch out. are the perfect length for cute falls or tucked into boots. i adore them!
other I fell in love with this online and i'm so thrilled that it's even more beautiful in person. it is a stunning, very dark teal velvet with the most gorgeous embroidery. perfect fit, quality, and nicely lined. a keeper for years to come! i think it's true to size (for reference i'm 5'1, 100 lbs and the 0p fits perfectly)
other Perfect for work or a night out. packing for europe, wore it out on a saturday night with leggings and heels. layer it after yoga got it in all colors love
other I was hesitant to purchase since this price is expensive for a tank, but the quality and true shimmery-ness are worth it. it fits very well and goes with many different sweaters. very happy with my purchase!
other In love with this. as soon as i received it in the mail i ordered another color. super soft and easy to wear. i imagine i will live in this top the rest of the summer. felt pricey, but worth it for as much wear as i will get out of it. i am 5'10, 160 and the large is a great fit. perfect fit on the shoulders and just a hair loose throughout the rest of the tank, which is what i wanted.
other Fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and ordered it right away. however i was sadly disappointed once it arrived. while the cut is cute, the fabric is just all wrong. i was expecting a nice, heavy knit-like material, but this feels and looks really cheap - especially given the price of the dress. sadly it is going back.
3 This top was so pretty online! unfortunately it did not work for me- the front was a bit more shapeless in person, though the back was gorgeous, with a button gather at center. the color appeared yellow online, but was a bit more green in person. also, the armholes were very low, so it would need a camisole or no bra.
other I was unsure about this top at first because of reviews saying "maternity"and this shirt can have that feel if you look at it from that point. i tried it again and the arm holes fit perfectly. it has a swing cut and a peplum style which brings lots of fabric and swing. it's not that it runs big it's supposed to swing/flow from body like many styles but the peplum adds bulk because it's a little thicker fabric. so i can see how some may think maternity because of all the fabric and cut, but i lov
other When i tried these on in the store i was thrilled - they were comfy as yoga pants and  the fit was divine. i thought i had found the perfect jeans and i splurged on them for my birthday. after wearing just two times they are baggy and the knees are totally bagged out, saggy and faded.so disappointing - i want my $180 back!
other I really love this top. it looks great under a black tahari suit that i wear to work. the neckline looks really nice. the only negatives are that it's a bit sheer, so i have to wear a tank under it and it's a little wide. it looks fine tucked in or hanging out with jeans for a more casual look. i'd recommend this top, especially if you can get it on sale. pretty true to size. i'm 5'4'', 120 pounds, and a 3other c and the size other top fit me nicely.
3 I really wanted to love this dress.... i absolutely love the fabric and the bottom of it. sadly, the top was just too "balloon like" and poofed out way too much. i tried putting a belt with it which helped a little bit. if the top had been just a little more fitted this would be awesome. i don't know if a smaller size would have helped the issue... i ordered a small and considered an xs but in the end just returned it.
other Love this dress! the colors are a smidgen darker than the photo shows, which i like even better. super comfortable, nice flow, great fit. definitely will be a favorite of mine for this summers
other I love the tiger print. its subtlety is the perfect added quirk to an outfit.
other This is interesting material- very heavy and smooth. it is fits great, i was able to size down. the color is a brown/copper and should match most things. overall, it is a great skirt for colder weather since it is thick material.
other I got this top in white and it is cute. the fabric is a weird kind of polyester, and kind of shiny. i got the medium and it pulls a little around the chest. overall i like it.
other So i now own three sparrow wool sweater dresses (shyle, bressay, this one). they all have the same problem...hips cut large/wide past the waist! everything from the waist up fits great. i'm not sure who they are using as a fit model, but she must be curvy in that j.lo way (which is nice but not my shape). i love the green color, the warmth, the neckline, and the easy fit. i will wear a coat to hide the body of the skirt. and do more squats
other I have received so many compliments on this top. it really looks exactly like it does on the model, and i'm not as thin as she is. i am 5'5" and 13other lbs,, small on top, and bought the small in this top. the v-neck is very flattering and is hangs so nicely that it does not make me look hippy. looks great from all views. i paired it with white pencil pants and wedge heels. also, the black lace detail down the sides looked great when i paired it with black yoga pants and flip flops. the colors are
other This is my first tracy reese piece, and i love it already. the somewhat edgy, unique, grommet and navy embroidery on the neckline and upper arms is very flattering on the body. the silky cotton texture surprised me; it's 60% cotton/40% viscose. it drapes well and feels good on. i will definitely enjoy wearing this for work or nice casual. i love that it is regular bra friendly. and that i don't need to stress about a low neckline. i am size 8/medium, 34f, and the medium is terrific. i got the an
other I ordered this in my usual retailer size, xspetite and it was too baggy in the bust. granted, i'm only a 34aa, but i would still expect it to be a little smaller in the bust at that size. the elastic waist was a little loose too (i have a 26" waist, 34" hips) and the inner slip showed a tiny bit like another reviewer said but it's the same fabric as the dress. the slip is adjustable but it's attached to the dress at the waist. it wasn't flattering on me in the hips either. this was a miss for me b
other I visited my local retailer store to purchase a dress and left with two of these tunics.( i love browsing the retailer store, its a feast for my senses)the pavin buttyondown tunics are much more appealing in person.all three feel different due to their color and pattern. to me the burned orange feels like country and fall, the pastel grey one feels spring like and more elegant and the white one feels like summer. they all look very cute on.i did size down and still got the oversize flowing look.this
other I am so glad i got these pants. the quality is great and the fit is perfect. they are very flattering and comfortable. i have worn them with flip flops on a casual day and have also worn them with black heels for a date night. worth the purchase!
other I love these shorts, nice material, good fitting, and great look. i sized up, usually an 8 and i ordered a 10 based on others reviews and it was the right choice. these are a great casual short or dressed up with shoes and a nice shirt.
3 Cute shirt but no worth full price for sure. runs small in the bust. and i am not busty at all. definitely order up a size. i am returning mine, however, because of size and price.
other Well, i totally disagree with the previous reviewer on this one! i think this top is very pretty. yes, it does hide any flaws in the tummy, but it is not wide nor does it make you look pregnant (side or front view). i am other ft, other inches, broad shouldered, 36c and the small fit nicely (i usually wear a small to medium in retailer tops). i am thinking of purchasing the xs as there is still plenty of room around the chest/arm area. the lace is pretty, looks good worn with a dark colored pant. the only
other I bought this top at my local retailer in a burgundy color. it is so beautiful and feminine. i want to get it in the other color they had in the store and also this black one available on-line. i bought it in a size 6 and i am 5' 2" , 34d. i sometimes get tops in petite but i felt the reg size fit just fine.
other I've been searching for wide leg trousers for what seems like years. and finally, i have found them--and on sale!!i agree that these trousers are long for ladies of average height. i am fairly tall (5'8") and the length is perfect for me. i don't anticipate that i will have them hemmed.i really love the detail of the tie waist. one could wear these with or without the ribbon belt. i would say that the button closures are a bit less than substantial for the quality and weight of the fabric.i s
other I loved the look of this dress the moment i saw it but was ridiculously long. at 5"3 i can usually get away with buying regular length longer dresses and pants with the help of heels if needed but not a chance this time. this dress does not come in petite and the fringed bottom design of the dress would not allow for any type of altering either.
3 Recommend this vest - nice design - fabric is thicker than expected - might suggest a size smaller - plenty of room in loose styling
other I love this skirt! it is a lovely and soft gauze layer with lining underneath. i live where the summer"s are hot and humid and this skirt keeps me cool when everything else just sticks to me. it is, for sure, very limited because it does not have a zipper.... if you cannot get this over your hips or over your shoulders and bust, this is not the skirt for you. the elastic waistband is really strong and really highlights your waist, but yes, i am petite and i struggle to get it on. once it is on,
other I tried this topper sweater on at the store but wanted to wait for it to go on sale so i just purchased it with my extra thirty percent off and think it's such a nice deal. i really like how this one is soft, well made, has nice long sleeves and how adorable the inside lining is. the lining matches the print inside the pockets that peak out a bit. i didn't find this one too boxy for me as it's a topper after all. there are no closure buttons or clasps but i think it's a great piece to throw on w
other I was drawn to this top due to its unique detailing and soft, casual cotton feel. i wear a nude bra underneath with no problem. i'm 5'5" 120 (34c) and the small hits right at my hips, so it's not to short or too long. i often wear an xs in tops and i didn't even try on the xs in this one because i felt the small fit just right. with the cutout detailing, i'll hand wash this. i hope it holds up.
other Since these are high waist pants, i think the size given is more for a lower waist measurement where most pants these days typically sit. i'm 5'10", 150 lbs and ordered a size 3other but it was much too large. i love the style of these pants a lot. they look great if you have long legs, the size 3other ran about 5" above my ankle, higher than is shown in the photos but it looks great.
other Love the feminine styling of a classic tunic tee! i'll wear it with black leggings this fall. super cute to wear casually or dress up a bit with some jewelry and/or a scarf.
other Like the other reviewers, i opted for the grey version. almost every tunic dress i've tried winds up looking like a sack when it's on my body, so i was very pleased when this dress looked pretty great. the neckline is perfect - nice depth and addition of on-trend lacing - and the length (love the shirttail hemline) is also perfect. the drape of the material keeps it from looking like a shapeless bag. my only comment #and it's quite minor - i'd give this 4.other stars if i could) is that the pockets
3 This dress is very cute and is made well.  i bought up a size from what i usually where as one reviewer mentioned the dress is small in the bust. this is always a problem for me therefore i ordered a 14. i was surprised that the 1other was sung in the bust. and then understood why the 16 was sold out. i was 30/40 lbs heavier when i wore a 16..never would have thought i'd have to order up that high. i've been running a 10 or 1other depending on the level of my activity. i'm keeping the dress because i kn
other I love most pure and good clothing pieces, mostly because the fit and fabric are comfy and made of good quality materials. this tunic does deliver on both counts, but i is very, very long and straight up and down.fyi: i have a boyish figure, having no waist/hips. i have a broad shoulder/back, so the cowl neckline coupled with the very long and straight tunic doesn't really flatter my body. it would be okay for just haging around the house, but i wouldn't feel comfortable wearing this tunic out
other I tried this on in the store last night and decided to order it today. it is a really beautifully made and flattering dress, with very interestingly cut seams. the fabric is a distinctive flower pattern that has been overlaid to appear almost abstract. gorgeous and high quality!fit: i am 5'6" and curvy, usually a size 14/16, and the xl fits quite roomy on me (that's the size i ordered because i like flowy things). so it definitely runs large. usually i have better luck with a-line dress shap
other This wash is so beautiful but i found the rise too long for me. so happy i found them in 24p here on the site. they are wonderful but i'd like to caution with respect to proportions:i have long legs (for a petite, ha!) and a petite upper body. these jeans almost entirely differ with respect to length. so id say if the your torso is fairly true to a regular fit, and your legs are shorter, you totally save on hemming the regular fit jeans. like another reviewe noted, hemming will reduce the fl
other All the reviews have said the truth. this shirt is absolutely adorable in terms of the top. but you will definitely need this tailored at the waist. give it a little more taper at the seams to suit a woman's curves. it seems almost funny they didn't do it to start with given the really feminine details on this shirt with the lace and the sleeves...
3 I never write reviews
other Tiny are experts at making busy bohemian shirtdresses that look casual but retain a feminine drape.  it skims over my trouble spots without adding bulk.  this is my fourth dress from this label and it does not disappoint.  for my frame and style i chose tts but those of slender & petite builds may want to size down.  for reference i am 5'3" 140# 36dd.
other Agree with other contributer - this is a great piece to snag on sale. i bought this other months post partum with the intention of hiding the post baby belly - which is does well! i think it fits true to size (i'm typically l and this l fit well). i can see how certain body types it would look maternity, but i'm short and curvy and the blouse is flattering. it's lightweight, so i plan to add a cardigan in the fall/winter.
other I am six feet tall so this will definitely be a tunic with jeans or leggings but if you are shorter it could easily be a dress. lovely pattern with soft cozy fabric. nice weight and hangs well. definitely a keeper!
3 I ordered this dress before it became available in my local retailer store. i love the style of this dress but the fabric was not as expected. it is a heavy/fuzzy knit and i had envisioned something lighter and cleaner. i would love to see it in a different fabric! sadly returned it....
3 I read all reviews and i decided to try as the price was great. first of all i am 5'6" 14other lbs, athletic build (not skinny but have muscles). the sweater fits great, just like glove, it does not make me look fat. the quality is great,sweater is warm, cozy and well-made. i am not sure about color as it's brighter as it shown. it is not quite coral, it's a little bit darker which will make it difficult to match it with. the sleeves run small so if you are taller then me just keep it in mind. th sw
other I love this coat. i bought it in 2012, and it still looks great in 2015. i only wear it a few times each season, but it makes me smile. it's tailored, feminine, and a bit flashy. it's fairly warm, too.
other Wasn't too sure about this jacket when i got it in the mail - seemed a little boxy on - maybe a smaller size would've worked better but i want to be able to layer. however, i'm keeping it because it's versatile, i love the contrast of the front/back and the buttons on the sleeve (which actually button and un-button, meaning they aren't just for show and the sleeves can be easily rolled up). a great basic jacket with some neat details.
other Love the dress! feel it fits true to size or slightly larger...knocked off a star as my dress arrived without the slip liner. i luckily have a slip that works from another dress...the beading is a lovely surprise! subtle and just enough sparkle in the sun, but not too much.
3 I wish it were easier to get in this dress. i'm 5'other with a 36d and i couldn't get it on. it's so pretty though.
other I bought this in the blue motif and i love the colors of the plaid. the first day i wore it i received many compliments. the armholes are a bit low but i wore a cami underneath. i don't think it is that noticeable unless your arms are raised the whole time. i like my shirts to be a bit longer and this is perfect since i have a longer torso. i am normally a size 6/m/34b and the med fit perfectly.
other It's sheer, the design /print is casual, but on silk like material. had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it! who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer???
3 This runs very small and has a beautiful design but it feels very cheap. material feels like thinnest possible t-shirt material out there. surprised with retailer on this one. back home to retailer it goes!
other Hi, these are really nice. the material is thick. they will probably be warm in the heat. they are made of 100% polyester. if they were made out of linen they would be perfect.
other I love this duster. it's really different and interesting. i wear it with the dress in the picture but i have the green dress.
other I have been looking for a good red cardigan for some time now. this one perfectly meets my needs, and now i want it in more colors. the sweater has a nice cut, and it is very soft and comfortable. i know this will be a go to staple piece in my closet.
3 I love the metallic colors of this top and figured i could wear it under a ruched jacket and circle skirt for work. welp, that's out the window. this design is poor. for one, this is not a piece for a petite woman with no torso and i don't know how anyone with a longer torso wears t his. this hits above my belly botton on and i got apetite 2. i have no torso. so, without a jacket, i would never wear this. it's very low cut..the back is very low..it's a little loose but i run between a other and a 4.
other First off, i love the dress! i love anything that you can throw on for a monday and be ready in 20 minutes. the material is good but the compartments for the bust do not hold a d+cup. i ordered the 6 and it fit perfectly except in the bust. easy fix, a white cami, the sale price makes that necessity acceptable. it's a keeper.
other I usually take a small in retailer tops. i did have to order this in a medium though because it is slightly more form fitting. the material seems a little thin so i hope it holds up well over time. i love the green color though. i am curvy especially on the bottom and this was very flattering on me. i do think it is too expensive for what it is especially with the material being thin (even at sales price). overall though, i thought it flattering enough to keep.
other Love love love the cut of this tank top. it's is super thin and see thru however. wish it was made a bit thicker. i got it in white and you can see right thru it. however the cut is so fabulous i can over look that.
other This shirt can look very elegant thanks to the nice duffs and hidden button line. the material is pleasantly substancial and very soft. the only thing i did not like is that the bottom button broke it two pieces the tirst tme i buttoned it. no spare buttons included, but as the buttons are not visible i think i can find a similar one to replace it. not big enough of an issue to return,
other Currently wearing right now :)purchased during the first days of the tag sale. runs large (i.e. i typically wear m-l, and ended up going with a small!). definitely need a tank underneath, as the hook does not close the top of fully. like the blue color; the pink is more of a peach and made me look incredibly washed out.a must at the tag sale price!
other I like this top. it provides a nice pop to the fall/winter dark wardrobe pieces. the picture gives off a blue hue, but the top is black, kind of a dusty black. the picture also gives the impression that the leaves are turquoise, but they're actually more green. at any rate, it is nice addition to my very dark winter wardrobe. i cannot wait to wear it with white denim like the model and something in the green family. i definitely recommend it.
3 Construction excellent. the dress was pretty big around the hip...does not have a shape like seen in the picture. the fabric was beautiful but was stiff...like furniture. the color was not as vibrant as the picture. returned.
other Well-made and well-designed tunic top. looks great over pants. not recommended for tucking in, as the pin tucks hit right at the waistline. the ivory is a bit see-through so i wear it with a cami underneath. be aware that your bra will likely be visible through the cut-outs in front. i didn't realize that the first time i wore it and was amazed to discover, at the end of the evening, how tacky it looked. to avoid that you need a low-cut bra. with the proper undergarments, this is a great top tha
other I bought this top in two colors--i think it's a really cute, easy top to wear, but the fabric is extremely thin and poor quality. i tucked the front into a pair of shorts and i can already see a small snag forming, which i'm sure will be a hole in no time. two stars only because i really do like the look of the top generally, i just wish it was something that was going to last beyond a couple of wears.
other The color is perfect for fall and into winter. only the inside collar on the photo shows the subtle plaid lining. the lining was an unexpected bonus, and adds even more dimension to the shirt if the sleeves are turned up.the fit is true to size and the 'stressed' velvet fabric is current for this season.i'm going to enjoy wearing this shirt.
other I can always count on retailer to sell unique pieces, so when i saw this sweatshirt online, i ordered it right away.  it&#39;s adorable and quirky, however, when i received it in the mail, it reminded me of something my grandma would wear.  the sleeves are puff sleeves and are really long, while the bottom of the sweatshirt hit pretty high on my waist that when i raised my arms my stomach was showing.  if this was a more tailored sweatshirt, i would be keeping it, but sadly it&#39;s going back.
other I ordered this in a size small for a pre-wedding brunch in dc in october. i am 5' 4" and usually wear a m in dresses and a s in retailer tops. this dress is full and flowy, but the top is less generous if you are full-busted.. i am a 3other dd and the top of the dress is almost too small. i love it so much and it is so flattering and fun, so i decided to keep it. i can see wearing this on many more occasions.
other This dress is a winner, i'm baffled that there is only one review? i thought this was a dolan dress. the material is soft and substantial. the cut and style hides figure flaws without adding bulk. this versatile dress is perfect for all seasons and all social situations. i'm 5'3" 135# 38/28/3other and purchased size m.
other I really wanted to love this top, but the fit was just off on me. the design and material is so pretty. however, i expected the fit to be more "peplum", but there was not any structure. i think this would be better on more slender women.
other When this dress first showed up online, i liked it, but didn't buy it because i wasn't in love. retailer weekend popped up, so i decided to take advantage of the 15% off and ordered this dress. it shipped to me in no time! the dress is beautiful. the fabric is soft and airy. this is the first "off the shoulder" dress that actually stays off the shoulder. no riding up, no fussing! i suggest sizing down because this dress is slightly flowy.
other Gorgeous colors and great shape for a mini dress. stunning on. the only con is how low the back goes. a bra alone underneath is not possible. will need to wear with a finer shirt underneath.
other I am glad to add this very versitile top to my wardrobe. it can be worn with a sweater in the cooler months (like i wore it today), a business jacket, or alone in the summer. i wore it with a fit-and-flare skirt today, but it goes with pants, jeans, shorts, etc.fyi: i am a 36 c(34d), short waist, broad shoulders/back, size m in knit tops, 10/1other in fitted or ones with buttons. i purchased my normal size m in this top.i have no real waist, so the shape of the top really does help to make one for
other Very cute top. i went down a size because for me it was a little large in the back, but that was just my taste. i purchased the denim print.
other Only worn this once but had multiple compliments! such a cute pattern and style. only complaint is wish they would have done the sides with a split. it kind of wants to hug the hips and then be too wide in the middle. still, love it!
other A good sweater but something about it was just not right for me. just didn't feel like i would wear it.
other I had to return this blouse because it ended up been too small and super itchy. im kind of busty but medium usually works and this one was super tight across my chest. not comfortable at all and the fabric is kind of a sheer with the sparkly lines in silver.wouldn't recommend it.
other I love this top. i had no issues with fabric. it is soft and light. the wrist details are very pretty. i love the buttons. it fits true to size and it is a good layering top. i got the red which is true to the picture. not looking red but a bright coral color.
other These are my favorite pants. i love the fit and they are comfortable. i have them in several colors. i hope you never discontinue them!
other I really likes these jeans. they are comfortable with stretch and look cute. the price is high but an investment for sure !
other A fabulous light weight jacket. love the detail and fit is perfect and comfortable. the jacket was not so interesting on the display table but once tried on it became mine and i suspect this is going to sell out. i really love the light color denim trim on the lapels. a keeper!  i purchased a medium and that is my standard size in retailer jackets.  for reference: 3other dd  and 14other pounds and 5'other height.
3 Just didn't look as cute on me as the pics online. the color blocking was kind of odd actually. returning.
3 Beautiful detail and soft sweater. i ordered a medium and the toro so fit well but was short. arms were long and baggy in comparison. given the fit, i didn't think the small would work. really wanted this to work but unfortunately it is going back.
other The color pattern in this material pops a lot more in person than on the website. fits perfectly, very versatile regardless of the occasion or the season (at least in california!). love it.
other I have worn these exclusively for the past couple of years. they fit great (tts), stay put, and wear very well. these are well worth the price.
other So cute! rompers are hard because they are so cute but rarely work for all body types. this one is so super cute. the material is so soft and comfy, feels silky. i got a small and fits perfect. i'm 5'4" and 117lbs so it runs very true to size when most clothes from retailer run big. i love rompers but only have one other one. this is by far my favorite! i can't wait until it's much warmer and i can wear it all the time.
other I love this dress so much that i bought it in other colors: one in blue and one in orange. great style, comfortable and quality material. however, the cut is much, much deeper than it appears in the pictures. women with bust should be conscious of that. the blue is the better color. the orange looks more like a fluorescent, red-orange. still cute, but not as subtly muted as it appears in the pics. overall, great dress. even better with the sale price.
other Fits great and just as pictured. the material is very smooth and slinky.
other I am 5'5", 14other lbs, a cup. depending on the style of the shirt i am between a medium and a small at retailer, in this case i purchased a small. even in the small the body has ample space which adds to the relax look without appearing sloppy. and because the shirt is wider i would say you can easily size down. the shirt is definitely flirty and fun with a great print, and easy to wear off of the shoulders. i invested in another retailer top that is also an "off of the shoulder" design but it does not
other I got the tan one. my friend got the same skirt. she's tiny, i'm not (i have hips). we both got a size 6, and it fit us both. it just sits higher on my waist than it does on hers (above my navel - not above hers). i do have a small waist. the skirt has a lot of movement, but isn't poofy. it is not see-through. it has that retailer charm, where it looks pretty basic but is really flattering and charming. a new wardrobe staple. can dress it up or down. only problem is the zipper in the back -
other Absolutely amazing! a must staple in every one's closet this season. i purchased the dress in a medium for a more relaxed look/feel. the silhouette is comfortable and makes for the perfect put on
other Beautiful and comfy!!!! love it!
other The print, layers and fit of this dress remind me of the 1990's but in a good way! the outer dress is voluminous and flowy, so i understand why some reviewers feel the dress runs large. the embroidered slip is tts and quite the cherry on top. i really appreciate that styling detail. 140# 36dd 5'3" and i chose medium regular length, not petite since i'm older and wanted the length.
other This top had so much potential! i bought the striped colorway in an xs, which is my normal size. i am a 32d with an athletic build so the sleeves are tighter on my arms than pictured, although they are adjustable. the top of the shirt fits perfectly, but the bottom is very wide and short. i'm only 5'2" but it's still just a tad shorter than i'd like. i wish it was slightly more fitted and then it would be perfect. unfortunately, this one is going back.
other This vest is so functional. i think it is much prettier in person than in this photo. it has a much softer look to it and is less orange, more tan. i've worn it with a lot of different things: over a sweater dress at work, with soft pants and a long-sleeve t-shirt, or skinny jeans/pants and a simple top. wish it came in other colors (gray, navy or green would all be amazing)...one of my favorite pieces this season for sure. i do think it runs a little bit large, but i think the next size smaller
other Other reviews are right, it is a little short in front. but it's such an adorable dress that i don't care! i love the material. super soft.
other Skirt fit perfectly, nice construction - hidden zipper, full lining - nicely done. would love to see it in navy or black.
3 I'm not much for ponchos, but this one looked unique. it is thin, kind of a felt material - that was expected - but i was surprised to find it was shorter at waist than how it appears online,, and it was wide horizontally. the colors were more muted and the design was slightly off center unlike pic. the turtleneck was thick and itchy. it was a return.
other I bought this dress for a christmas party and received lots of compliments! at 50, even though i live in a cold climate i was looking for something (not black!) stylish, and comfortable that i would not roast in at a party! it is a beautiful green color with nice embroidery front and back and the shape is very boho. i like my dresses a little more fitted so i bought the xs (and i am usually a small ...so size down!) and had the waist nipped in a bit by my seamstress to give it more of a flatteri
3 I so wanted to keep this sweater but the invisible metallic threads that give the sweater its crinkled appearance are super scratchy and irritating. it definitely requires a long sleeved top to prevent the irritation as shown in the online photo. it is lightweight and i planned to wear it over sleeveless summer tops/dresses. i have averaged size arms and there was plenty of upper arm room. in fact extra room is designed into the sleeves. one plus for those with upper arm fit concerns. the lower
other Bought one for myself and one for my mom.  we both love it.  super soft. boxy and oversized but great for layering over a belted tunic.
other I am very petite (size 00, xxs) and i got the smallest size this top came in and it fit great in the bust and arms but the bottom billowed out a little too much for my body frame type. it is so beautiful i had considered getting it altered, but the material was simply too see through so it had to go back. beautiful gauze material and detailing though!
other I was hesitant to buy this because some reviews said that if you were busty it would fit tight and awkward across the chest.. i'm petite, 32c, 5ft and purchased the xsp in white .it is gorgeous! it fits a tiny bit big and i think i could have gotten away with a xxsp, but i like the flowiness of this size i have so i'm keeping it. it does not feel tight across the chest at all and hangs beautifully. i love it! the material is gorgeous and it is well made.
3 I saw this in that postcard "catalog" and it drew my attention immediately, so when i saw it at the store, i knew i would try it on.this dress is gorgeous - the lace is sturdy and won't easily be caught on things, the chambray is substantial but light. it's put together well and the slip covers greatly. the material isn't stretchy, but it keeps it shape and i like that. i'm 5'7" and it hit me right at the knee, so it's a good length if you wanted to wear it with a cardigan to work as a spring
other I didn't realize that there were sequins on the design. they kept poking my shoulders and made the top very uncomfortable. the white material was also not very flattering on me. it went back.
other Too bad the blue one is sold out in my size (petite), i ordered the 00p, based on feedback at m store that it runs big, that was a good choice (i am 5'1.5", 11other lbs#. the material teds to wrinkle though, so will have to think about keeping it.cut is flattering, i like it with the belt like the picture on the model, but was nice too with the drawstring and a nice chunky necklace #bought black dress, so gold necklace is nice).length was mid calf, but because it has a rounded hem, it wa
other I did like this coat, however the material was just not what i expected. i was hoping for more of a traditional wool material, but this had a fuzziness to it. not fitted in the waist either, which might just be the style but not what i was hoping for.
other So i'm not sure if its just my body type or what, but this did nothing for me. the bottom, which i thought would be too big was actually too small in both the small and the medium (i'm a size 8 bottom) and then when i sized up to the medium it was still too tight and then the top was loose. i just think this one is going to take the right body type. it could look really beautiful on the right person, just not me.
other This is a beautiful skirt. i'm very pleased with the quality. it runs small though, i'm usually size small and went for the medium. i'm 5' other and got the regular vs petit, which would have been too short for me to wear at work.
other Love the style of this shirt. its flattering and light material, good for all weather and layering.
other Really nice quality warm, sleek sweater. runs small-ish. i'm 5'8", 140 lbs, 34c. i got the small and could have gotten x-small.
other The peach color is beautiful on this jacket, and the quality and comfort is perfect. i wear a medium and the sizing was spot-on. i may get in another color if a sale comes around again.
other The jacket is great, the quality is very good and the fit too, the best part is how it looks !
other The delicate detail at the neckline on this sweater adds such a pretty yet subtle touch.i layer it with various camis for a different look each time.i ordered the dark yellow and it is a very unique and rich shade, and goes well with so other many colors.looks gorgeous with a mint or aqua cami for a peek a boo effect.classic yet unique!runs very true to size.
other This is now one of my favorite retailer button downs. it's super soft and super flattering. it's everything you'd want this cute shirt to be!
other Very nice casual corduroy skirt for the fall. it sits nicely at the waist and the asymmetrical cut gives it some visual interest. it has a slightly a-line shape and the side seams round up a couple of inches. i took a point off for it not being lined, and the closure relies on the zipper alone instead of having a hook along with the zipper. i took my usual small and like how it fits. my only concern is that it is a little on the short side for me but since it's a fall skirt and will always be wo
3 I practically live in lounge pants, and i like the unique style of this wide-leg version. i'm generally a 6/28 in pants and ordered the small which fit well, if a bit big. the overall fit is great - slim at the hip with a nice wide waistband, and flatteringly-placed dropped pockets. the pants really slim my hips and provide a nice silhouette with the wide legs. the fabric is soft and flows and i did not experience any sheerness. as for color - i would call these a deep cool brown, definitely not
other The picture is not a good representation of the cut and the fabric. the cut is a-line, trapezoid-shaped. the shirt is smallest in the shoulders and chest and then it flairs out to the sides. the cut works with pants mostly, you have to tuck the shirt in if wearing with skirts. the lace back drapes beautifully and is a little longer than the front, which again lend to wearing with skinny pants and such.the fabric has a quality of freshly starched. pleasant surprise. it lacks softness of leisure
other Tried this little number on in store...... i am 5other years old..... not a bad body.... gave this a shot. it looks minus my slightly wrinkled knees great ....and very close to what it looks like on model. very happy with one!!!
other I love this top!! fits perfectly, and not too long. i'm 5'4", 11other lbs and a 32dd and the small fits like a gem.not too fitted, but not boxy. i like that it covers my waist, but isn't too long, either. i may order another one i love it so much!
other I love this dress! splurged while i was doing my christmas shopping to get this for myself, and i'm so glad i did! it's such a comfortable dress - stretchy and not too thin or too heavy of a fabric. it pairs well with tights and a long cardigan in the winter, or on it's own with a statement necklace. style and fit are great - this dress is super flattering,
other Bought peach online, but exchanged for other color. there is a metallic gold stripe that i didn't expect in peach option. i thought i would mention as it wasn't so apparent in photo. interestingly there is no metallic thread in the other color option.
other I ordered xs/petite but i think i better ordered xxs which was already sold out at the time i purchased. i recommend one size smaller for this sweater. this sweater is designed very wide for your shoulder which could be fallen down for people who usually prefer petite size but it's really adorable!!
other Although beautiful colors this eyelet dress is quite heavy and the buttons have no give- one of them literally cracked when i tried to unbutton it. unbuttoning it was difficult due to the tight weave. it just misses the mark and will be going back.
other In paper crown dresses, i wear a small or size 6, so for this top, i ordered a small. it was huge on me! for reference, i'm 5'7", 130 lbs, 34a. it is very wide towards the bottom, and it flares out way more than in the picture. the material is also a little stiff, so it really sticks out. even if i sized down to the xs, i think the bottom would still look unflattering, so i'm returning this.
other In person this pattern is vibrant and lovely. i usually wear an xl in tops but in flowy ones like these i can size down to a l, which i did. the nice thing about the cut is it minimizes a large bust while maintaining a nice shape. it is a bit long which lengthens the torso if you are short like me. the bib portion is almost quilted and very substantial. all in all, a great purchase.
other I love this jacket. let's be clear though...it's not for warmth just for style but it's perfect for fall in california. i love the detailed work and have already tried this with so many different layers, a light blue tank, off white shirt, tshirt and it looks great with lots of things and truly makes the outfit. love unique pieces like this and i will be wearing it often. i bought my usual size small. sleeves are a bit long for my 5'other frame but they didn't have in petite and it looks great.
other I would have loved this top if it were the length pictured on the model, but it was a cropped length on me :(
3 This is a darling little sweater. it is well made and the fit is true to size, however, it's just not long enough on me to be a top, which is what i was hoping for.  i thought it would be pretty with some high waisted trousers in a sort of 40's style but it's way to short on me for that. even with my highest waisted pants and skirts, it shows skin.  i think it can really only be worn as a shrug over a dress or something.  that explains why the model looks hunched over in some photos.  i'm still
other This is a great lounging dress or a great beach cover up. i ordered up a size after reading other reviews. although, i feel like my normal size would have been fine probably. i ordered the black and it is not see through. it's very light weight and comfortable. i may even order in another color just because it's so great to wear around the house.
other This coat is super yummy! i'm always in need of something stylish and warm at the same time. definitely was happy with the weight and lining on this garment.*highlight: i always get compliments on it when i'm out.
other Ordered a few things for a last minute decision on what to wear to a wedding - i slipped this on right out of the box and decision was made! tunic style is great for all body types and hides any bulges. crochet neckline and sleeves are cute and a little sexy. dress is very comfortable and not too short. wore this with pearls and ankle-strap pumps for a dressier look. very happy with this one!
other I was surprised how much i like this shirt. the fit is really pleasing. at first i thought it would be a "whatever" shirt, but i think i will actually wear it a lot more. it will look cute dressed up with a cute necklace and flats. the price is a bit high for this top, but i felt it was worth it since it is so hard finding a casual shirt thats not your basic tee.
other This swimsuit is aaaahmazing. seafolly is an australian brand and their sizing is way off, luckily i already own a one piece by them so i knew what size to order. i am usually a 0 or a 2, chest size 3other d, and i ordered a 6 in this and it fits perfectly. taking it out of the package i wasn't sure if it would fit, but it did! the keyhole is pretty open, and the shape of the sides and high neck make some cleavage happen. i got it in black and it's really sohpisticated, but still sexy and cool. i ca
other Bought this for my daughter who is graduating this year. looks much better in person then it does in the photo. she is 5'7" and 135lb. we bought the size four. great length on her. green adds a nice pop of color. she loves it.
other The sweater is beautiful and lightweight. it is very short. i am short-waisted but felt that it was too cropped for me. the deign is lovely and the fabric is soft.
other I love the way this dress hangs straight down on the model, but on me it looked tacky.  i'm 5'6 and 130 lbs, and this dress hit me in all the wrong places.  i got a size small- sizing up would be huge in the top of the dress (and the arm holes are already dangerously large).  i wish this were just a little bit a-line.  instead, it's literally like someone just extended the length of a t-shirt.
other These pants are so comfortable. they're very flowy, and provide so much airflow to keep you cool during hot days. i actually bought these pants for work (i'm a teacher). i like to pair them with a white top and a cardigan. the waist band is elastic, which is super nice. the only thing i would like better is if the waist line was higher. the pants come up right below my natural waist, so they're not quite as high waisted as i would like. but other than that, their silky material give them the ill
other I noticed this top on one of the sales associates, and it looked great. she's probably 230lbs and about 5'5.  tried it on and it looked horrible, i even tried sizing down twice. i'm 5'8" and the ruffles started right under my chest. i gave other stars bc of the material, it is light, and summery.
other Just bought this cardigan today. i'm already a fan of left of center and was happy with this piece. it's soft, has more interest to it than your average cardi. the sleeves are a bit long, but it's not a dealbreaker. i imagine it will be a great transitional piece from summer to fall and then for spring time.
other The liatris floral top is a comfy sweater knit with floral accents on the front and sleeves. the back has a row of buttons though the top easily slips on over one's head. it contains wool but is not in the least itchy. in fact it has a silky feel to it in its finely knitted fabric . it would be cute with a patterned bottom, like a plaid or dotted pants as shown. doesn't seem to be easy to snag.
other I ordered xs petite. which they are sold out of. but in case you are a different size i wanted to write a review. i'm other feet tall and 120 lbs. i am 3other  d so busty. the petite did not overwhelm me. the pockets do open. you're supposed to cut the little threads out. ask a dry cleaner or an retailer stylist for help. i like that there is a little "stiffness" to the cape. it has holes for your arms. not a poncho. your lucky if they have your size!
other This pajama-like dress is not worth $150 (full price plus tax in texas), so i can't really justify keeping it. i kept having to pull it over on one side so it would align correctly. it also runs big. i bought the m (which i am returning) and it bunches at the waist but the length was perfect. the s is too short on the bottom. i love the color, but it's going back. i'd buy it if it were on sale.
3 I wish his dress would have worked. it is beautiful!! however, the waist and bust runs very small. the bottom of the dress does flare out a bit but the waist is so tight that unless you are a stick, everything at your waist and hips will stick out.
other Alright, so i really love this shirt. but i am having it taken in to fit me. i weigh 110 and am other foot 3 and pretty petite, and this shirt is too big on me and i got an xs. i didn't wanna get xxs and am glad i didn't because i think it would be too short. i'm going to keep the shirt, but it is too big on me, it puffs out in the front and some in the back when you stand certain ways and i need to have it taken in, or else it isn't as flattering as it should be. the material is awesome and i love
other I was surprised when my friend tried this on (they dind't have my size in store so she did), how ,uch materil there is on this top. it is very beautiful, but might be too much on a petite frame. the back is almost like a mini train, which is pretty ocol in my opinion. great colros in person too, yes, a tiny bit of shimmer :-)
other A great casual top for warm weather - the linen ensures its structure stands out, and the structure gives it more interest than a plan tee. does a fine job of hiding minor midsection lumpiness. can be dressed up a bit if worn with linen or cotton trousers. i bought the yellow and was pleased to find it wasn't too transparent. i bought the small and found it tts for an american small (bigger than a uk or european small). a versatile keeper.
other I just bought this and i really disagree with previous review that it runs big - i wear an 8 in skirts and bought another retailer skirt last week that fits just fine - this one does not even zip up. i might exchange for bigger size, as label is just a number to me and sizes are really inconsistent - or it may just go back.
3 Super cute sweater and i was totally excited and then i looked at the sleeves (which are not shown in the pictures). what you can not see are the dragonfly (sequins and sparkly beads suitable for women other and 84). ugh. too bad - going right back.
other Was excited to receive this top in the mail, and wasn't disappointed when i tried it on. beautiful colors (true to image) and pattern -the blue back does extend into the front, but does not look unflattering in the least or leave for an awkward fit, imho. very happy with this top, it looks so cute from the back, too~
other When i saw this skirt on line, i wasn't impressed--especially at the price. but then i saw it in the store and i had to have it! it's beautiful. definitely a colder weather skirt due to the nice weight of the fabric. the colors are lovely and subtle, with a little sheen, ensuring you can wear it with many tops and for many occasions, from everyday to dressier. length is just at the bottom of the knee for me (5'7"), with a flattering and comfortable cut.
other This is such a pretty top. i do not feel it runs big, as another review mentioned. to fit the sleeves comfortably (i do not have large arms at all) i did choose to take a small over my usual xs so the body is a bit llonger than shown on the model (a bit more of a tunic fit on me). it is really a pretty top either way, the xs fitting like it does in the picture on the model and the s fitting a bit longer. worried just a bit that it might develop holes as some tissue tees do.
other Gorgeous wide leg sweats. i did wear them outside but i wore with a long t because they are slightly see through if they are snug on your bum. they don't seem like they will last long because they are thin. but the cut is adorable and very flattering. they were a gift, not sure i would have spent $78 but i do love them.
3 Oh how i wanted this skirt to work.... the fabric - both pattern and color - is beautiful. the style is very nice. the knit is comfortable. but... the knit was so soft and pliable that it lost its shape right away. after wearing it for an hour, the front slit was curling in weird directions. the fabric around the hips got sort of crooked and hang-y. i would have loved the fabric to be one notch more substantial for a more defined waist and better integrity around the hips.
other There wasn't much question as to whether or not i'd love these pants, as i have several pairs of the pilcro "hyphen" pant; however, this one is slightly different (front pocket's and seam down front),and though they are slightly different, the fit and cut are the same.these pants are a great weight--can wear year round, really--but these will be my "go to" pants this fall and winter.the length is nice--can wear with shoes or rolled up with boots, too--"utility" chinos? yes!the fit is nicely
other This tank is well made and the top part is doubled (partially) so you can get away without wearing a bra (if you wish). i'm 5'other and tried on the standard xs in store because xxs was not available. it was a little bit longer on me than on the model pictured. the pin-tucked area fit well, not too tight or loose and the bottom part was flowy which i don't mind. i expect this top to shrink in the wash a tad which would make it perfect for me. i opted for the white vs. the black because i love the pi
other This dress is really simple and elegant and i want to love it but i'm having a hard time getting it to fit right. i'm normally a size 4/6 and i bought this in an 8 and couldn't zip it up. i'm a 36d which is part of the problem so i exchanged it for a 10 and i can now zip it but the bar in the back i thought would cover my bra strap but like other reviewers mentioned its a bit high. most of my bras fall right into the hole beneath the bar. its unfortunate because i wanted to love this dress. i mi
other I wasn't sure if this dress would hang correctly on me and make me look shapeless but i'm so happy with it! the fabric is so comfortable and the tie in the back really helps draw it in so my waist is defined. the length is great and it's super comfortable but looks polished!
other I wanted this so badly, to wear as a dress over a slip. but it is not cute or flattering when you put it on. it made me look 20 pounds heavier than i am, and the fit was awful. i usually wear an xs in dresses at retailer and this swallowed me. i am petite but this is just waaaaaay too big. so disappointed because it's so pretty.
other I honestly, have to give these jeans 5stars.  i loved them when i saw them in the store and had to have them and when i wore them, i got tons of compliments. they are super comfortable too!  i read some of the other reviews and thought that their comments were a little strange.  these jeans are obviously not classic and they will go of style but, if you run a little outside of the style box you will welcome them in your wardrobe.
other I bought this top for work but i can also wear it out with friends. it is made well and has a lining that is comfortable and makes it flow nicely. it will be nice for summer. you can tie the neck or just leave the ties down so it has options.
3 Read all the reviews i didn't really understand that it really had real shape wear in the skirt. i live in florida and found the dress to be too confining and hot. i would never get any wear out of it. much better for someone up north. had to return it.
other Just received this beautiful jacket of quality wool and superior design. i love it and wore it christmas eve with tailored black pants. the fit is perfect in the shoulders, sleeve length and generous in the hips, waist. i used the tie to gather it in a bit at the waist, but plan to have an inch or so taken in on either side at the hip to avoid my looking too wide. a matter of preference, but i have most things tailored--a must at my age! i felt young and attractive rather than old and non-descri
other I love this sweater it's so cute and so soft, and warm!
other I usually wear a small or a medium in tee shirts, and i had to get a medium so that it fit comfortable throughout the shoulder area.
other This is a gorgeous bathing suit. the colours are more brilliant than the ones in the picture, and much more beautiful. comfortable, chic, and unique
other These are great pants, have them in the green holly color
other I saw online, great quality sweater dress- reviews about seemingly extra fabric- easy fix with a seamstress. i have very sensitive skin and wear long sleeves under sweaters. wool, angora, mohair! 5'1, xsp, tts (length/arms) but lots of extra fabric for width. just trying it on was too itchy for me.
other I ordered the cream colored duster after purchasing the grey one in store. i loved the grey one so much i had to get the other color. i love the length of the item. i am 5'9" and don't feel like it is too short for me to get the look. it is light weight so i did not get too warm in it and will be able to wear it much of the year. i did wear it open as i feel that it runs a tad tight on the arms and torso when buttoned. however, i prefer the look of it worn open so that was not a problem for me.
other My review is of the "black motif" (no longer listed online, but i saw a bunch in the clearance sock bin at the georgetown dc store, today, 12/27/2015).i love beautiful and unique socks! so i thought i'd give these a chance. i like them so much that i bought 3 more pairs of the exact same sock now that they're on sale!two things i noticed... the way the sock is knit, when you put it on, it no longer has a matte black look in the black areas. it is sort of a stretched, slightly two-tone look.
other What a beautiful dress! a size other fit me perfectly- 5'other 120lbs. i have a small ribcage so it works on me but it might be too tight for someone with a larger one. the fabric is of amazing quality and i was so glad to see there is a liner under the skirt. the top has some delicate beading which looks great but i am concerned it will fall off at some point. i have found that retailer clothing tends to have loose buttons and beading. i have not washed it yet so i am hoping it holds up. otherwise, i am
other This color rich pattern will transition nicely into the fall season. it wears well with a bare leg and will look great with opaque tights later in the season. the higher waist and gathering work well on my figure.
other This is such a lovely dress -- and it looks great on! like other customers, i like the petal hem and the top part, which is stretchy, is soft and not clingy. i think the only drawback is that the color isn't as rich a green as it looks in the pic. i've attached a pic for comparison and contrast purposes.i'll be wearing this way into the fall!
other The material is great!! got them in both colors and went with a tall size for one. everyone compliments them!
3 If you have muscular thighs, like me, these won't fit well. i'm usually a size 8-fitted/10-relaxed, i bought these in a large and the shins were the most relaxed part. had to return for not fitting well. but the quality of the product was nice.
other This dress is very comfortable, not itchy at all and looks great. runs on the large side and is a tiny bit unflattering in the middle but it's still a worthwhile buy!
other It is a really cute sweater. i thought it would be a little longer based on the picture. on me it hits at my waist but i am still okay with it. the design is unique and i am happy with the purchase.
other Looking forward to wearing this blouse for the summer. easy to wear--no special bra needed. thin cotton material will be perfect for vacationing in japan. i wear a 4p but because the smocking in the shoulder area leaves the lower part of the shirt a bit blousy, i bought the 2p. i prefer the straight hems instead of the dresses and tunics with the longer back hem, which gives my petite frame the illusion of looking shorter. i liked this blouse so much that i bought it in the green and white strip
other This top is lovely; great colors for spring, light material, flow-y, and the cinching below the bust line creates a super flattering silhouette. i did have to size up to a other (i'm almost always a 0) to make some room for the girls (i'm a 3other c/d depending on the brand), so larger chested women may want to size up, but it's well worth it
3 Fits well through the shoulders and arms, but there is zero waist, and it just looks like a bunch of extra fabric hanging from the top. super cute, but have to return because of that.
other These pants are so comfy, well-fitting and flattering. i will order the same style in more colors and patterns because i can tell this will be my uniform this summer. true to size if you like a close fit like i do. size up if you like a loose fit. length is shorter than capri--more like a 1950s pedal pusher. cute.
other I have had this dress in the shopping basket on my retailer app and was dying to try it on in the store. luckily, newbury street in boston had it so i stopped by yesterday. the dress is everything i hoped and even better! the cut could not be more flattering. to get the nice, classic fit in the front, i stayed true to my usual size (4) but worried the buttons would be straining like another reviewer said. as soon as the bow in the front is tied, it keeps everything together and is very comf
other Love this sweater! great for work. very soft and comfortable. color is gorgeous!
other When i got this skirt i figured it was a muted sweater skirt. what i got was a much fancier sparkly sweater skirt. the blue is more of a bright sparkly teal and gold thread is woven throughout. oh my it's spectacular. really beautiful.
3 I am so sad that this romper didn't work out. it's just way too billowy and huge. i am usually between a small and medium so i ordered this small. i'm petite and somewhat curvy and i was absolutely swimming in this romper! might look best on taller girls. i am other 'other and about 125-130 lbs and this was like wearing a tent. do not recommend. such a bummer because i was a believer after treading all of the great reviews!
other As soon as i pulled these pants from their packaging, i feel in love with them. the fabric was so soft - i could not wait to get them on...yeah, that was not going to happen! i could not pull them on - not even a little bit! these pants run incredibly small. i ordered them twice: once in my regular size, and again in a larger size. unfortunately, i am sized out of these beauties.
other If you are afraid of the jumpsuit trend but like dresses, this will be for you.  the cut is flattering, and may not need a bra (i am droppy, but it was fine). the legs are wide enough that one time, i had both legs in one hole, so-to-speak, and it is very flowy. the patterns are both nice, i like the geometric one, but the polka dot is always a classic. the petite size fit me just right (xsp) at 11other lbs, 30dd. i like the tie it goes from around the cups to tie on the back, so you can almost ti
other This is a very flattering blouse, but it should be noted that holding horses tends to run large in size, so order down. the fabric is 100% cotton, gauzy and light. it is very soft on the skin. i was a bit uncertain whether to keep it at first because it required a bit of adjusting in the way it falls once on, but i decided to keep it and i'm glad i did. it is nice looking with jeans and leggings because the back of the blouse is longer, and because of the lightness of the fabric, it does not app
other This price is amazing and goes with everything! fits great! so glad i made this purchase.
other Very nice soft fabric, has a nice swingy drape and flair. i use it to work out in , sleep in and just hang out around the house. could be paired with white pink or black leggings and a scarf too. very happy with this purchase.
other Purchased this sweater in the blue color which is a gray/blue. it runs large as the xs is still quite roomy on me in the body. although the arms are more snug. great quality.
other Soft, cozy, and the heathered off-white/palest gray is a great cool-toned neutral. the only surprise was that it is lightweight; not nearly as warm as it looks. the hood has a fuzzy sherpa lining, the unlined jacket has a soft fleece or flannel finish on the inside with zigzag seams, the ouside looks like a sweatshirt. it does work great as a top layer though. 50% polyester, 38% cotton, 12% rayon..got this in a size 's' to fit my hips and it works out great. i'm 5'2", currently 33-25-37ish, wi
other I love hand knit sweaters. they look expensive. this sweater is pricey and i shied away from the original price. at the reduced price, it is worth it. my sweater is bright blue and pure white so not sure what other reviewer got. however, it is itchy. i admit that i have somewhat sensitive skin so if i cannot wear a silk layer under it, or find a way to make it less itchy on me, i will have to reluctantly return it. i normally wear large but the medium fit fine.
3 I just received this beautiful dress in the mail after ordering my usual size petite 12. words can't describe how beautiful the fabric and embroidery appeared as i pulled the dress from the box. i quickly tried it on. the length was perfect. but when i attempted to zip the side zipper, i realized that i would never be able to zip it up over my size 38c chest. the bodice is simply too small. sadly, i have to return the dress. this is my biggest disappointment from retailer so far. if you have a ver
other As the other reviewer stated the dress is not lined and the fabric feels very cheap. i tried the sp as well and felt i could have gone down to the xsp. i like the style and coloring but given the price and lack of quality this is going back.
other Just received this and know i will get a lot of enjoyment from it. cute fit and since i have had something similar in the past, i know how versatile it is. nice soft material too!
other This is a beautiful skirt. i wanted to make sure that i received a size that fit so i ordered two different sizes (pxs and ps). i typically wear a pxs but since the description mentions a side zip and it looked as if the skirt was to fit higher on the waist i thought i should also try a size up. as i mentioned it is lovely. light airy. i just wanted something easy to throw on and look put together with flat sandals and a tank for the hot weather that is coming and for an upcoming vacation to the
other This dress is absolutely beautiful! i wore it in my engagement photos and it is so flowy and so beachy. you can dress it up or down and it's very comfortable as well. unfortunately, it got ocean water on it in my photos, so i took it to the dry cleaners and they lost it :-( hopefully it will come back in stock and i can buy it again. it is easily my favorite dress i have owned in quite some time. for tall people - it may be too short to wear with anything but flats. i'm 5'6" and wore sandals and
other I tried these on in the store in the small and needed to xs, so i ordered them online. they are perfect! i wore them last night and got so many compliments. for reference, i am 5'2" and 12other lbs.
other Seafolly is my favorite swim/beach brand. the quality is always great! this is a colorful sheer kaftan that will get much use this summer.
other This is an ideal top - especially for summer. so lightweight and soft! the detailing is adorable and makes this simple shirt feel very special, yet everyday! i ordered the black, and am back for the other colors! this one is an absolute win.
other I love this! i will sport it in the spring with white capris/ leggings and awesome for a beach cover-up! the fit is comfy the embroidery gives it a feminine touch. i purchased the large but could've gotten away with a slender fit in medium. i am 5'other 170 lbs.
other This dress looks great on me. it gives a slender appearance which hides a lot and it's easy and comfortable to wear.
other Thin for this late in the season, but the colors are so pretty. i'm going to layer it over a long sleeve t, top with a cardi and pair with leggings. runs large. love the the unconnected slip. other stars.
other I'm 5'7", 34c, 28 jeans, size other dress. one of these beauties ended up in our store and i had to try it on. the sleeves are no joke - serious bell sleeves that could have looked comical with the polka dots, but is surprisingly chic. the one i purchased was a medium - never had an opportunity to try a small, which i suspect is my actual size. buying it oversized made this magical. it feels modern. i actually think because the whole sweater is oversized on me, it makes the sleeves less cartoonish.
other I ordered this online and was disappointed when it arrived. it didn't look quite like it does in the photos online. it also runs small. i returned it because i did not feel it was worth the high price.
other This is really cute - with a statement necklace or without. jeans or shorts. love it.
3 I ordered this turtleneck in white and was very surprised to find that the material is so thin and gauzy it's sheer. i will definitely have to wear a white camisole under this every time i wear it, even when using it as a layering piece. it seems to run true to size if not a little small. the neck is interesting because it is so light and floppy...you can adjust several ways. it doesn't hold form well, though. i will most likely keep it but will never wear it without something both under and ove
other Lovely socks, great color, stitched well, a little thin
other I absolutely love this cardigan! it is so soft and goes with anything. it can be dressed up or down. it is definitely my new "go to" for airplane travels. highly recommend!!
3 There isn't much shape to this dress. it's fairly straight from top to bottom. i'm smaller on top with a small waist but slightly pear shaped. the top half was somewhat loose but the bottom half just clung too much. i'm 5'2" and 107 lbs and bought a pxs for reference. also, i wore a tee shirt underneath and the dress shed all over it.
other I originally bought this in a petite xs. i am 5' 4" tall on a good day. sometimes longer sweaters can overwhelm me. but the petite was almost a bit snug and short in the arms. i exchanged it for a regular xs and while i now have to cuff the sleeves, the overall look is much better. i bought the gray but really liked the blue and moss too. will be very nice for the frigid days we have in ohio. looks great with leggings tucked into boots i think. a winner!
other This is a cross between a sweater and a sweatshirt. not a heavy weight but very warm. the color is vibrant. many compliments.
other I'm 5'other and bought the dress in a petite medium. i like to buy clothes that i can wear to work and this dress was almost too short. if it were any shorter, it wouldn't have worked. if i were to buy it again, i'd probably go with a non-petite size. also, i ordered the dress online and i found two snags in it as soon as i pulled it out of the box. i don't think they will be terribly noticeable, but just beware that this dress will apparently snag easily. i plan to wear it with a purse without meta
other Free and easy but the fabric seems cheap.
other I got this top in the pink. the colors and pattern are beautiful - i received so many compliments. it is very comfortable - it is "swingy" so i paired it with skinny jeans. i usually wear an xs or s - 0 or other in retailer tops - i got this in an xs and it fit perfectly.
3 I just tried on this dress in the store, in red, and i loved the off the shoulder design. the color is just as pictured online (a light poppy red). the neckline began a few inches below my collarbone and was super flattering. however, the skirt portion of this dress flared awkwardly at the hips, causing my hips to look much wider than they really are (and also disturbing the otherwise clean lines of the dress). it seemed to me that there was too much fabric at the back portion of the skirt than
other I was lucky to get these on sale with free shipping(my major lucky shopping moment of the year); however, they are worth every penny of the full price. i've waited years before shelling out this much for a pair of nice jeans, but now my skeptical opinion has done a 180 turn. these paige verdugo ultra skinny jeans are superior to any denim i've ever tried. they look and feel fabulous on me. i bought my usual 29/size 6 and am 5'1", 130#.
other The length hit at the wrong place for me. lovely knit though so i am very disappointed. it will be going back to the store. interesting muted color that strikes just the right balance. very warm - perfect for fall and winter.
other This dress was just perfect. the fit was just right and it is made well. love the ruffles... could definitely be dressed up or wore casual. great dress all around ... a keeper!!!
other Love,love, love this. it is so different and unique. definitely not something you will see in any other store. wore it last week and have never received so many compliments on one piece. so retailer!!!!!! it was very warm and comfortable. i did wear a turtleneck under this, because of reviews of itching. i did not have any problems.
other Got this dress in the mail today, and will have to say that it is not the most figure flattering dress i own. my 5'5" athletic frame looks pretty boxy in this. that being said, the fabric is a soft, shiny blue/green. the garment swings nicely and has a slightly lower hem in the back (on me, anyway) and i think that's fun. who needs close fitting clothes during the holidays ? i'm keeping it. i plan to wear it with hot pink tights and boots.
3 Recently started loving rockets. i own a pair in black and a pair that are distressed. i've found that the 27s fit me best. i am 5'7", 34c, 28 waist. this particular pair seems to run true to size, meaning i could get the 28s on (which is typically what i wear in other brands), but the 27s were embarassingly too small. while the 28s fit, and are made of a great weighty denim, with very little stretch, the wash was really not appealing. due to the distressing of the wash, all the lines butterfly
other I have the blue and holly joggers. i absolutely love the fit,  feel and color of the joggers. the oddity is that the elastic at the waist bunches in the blue pair but not the holly. it drives me crazy. i could only wear the blue for a couple of hours before i had to change into something else (unfortunately the holly joggers were in the wash).  i'm going to take the blue joggers to the seamstress. maybe she can fix them. 65", 135, small was perfect.
other Ok. stop everything, take out your credit card & order this blazer immediately! i'm obsessed with blazers, but was on the fence about ordering this one (i mean, how many black blazers can one girl own?!), but after reading the outstanding reviews, i decided to go for it & i'm so glad i did! the online pictures do it no justice whatsoever, & i was afraid the polyester blend & gold buttons would look cheap, but, boy, was i in for a surprise when i opened my package! the black fabric looks high-end
other I really want to love this shirt, but the small is just way too big on me. for reference, i'm a 32d (which is why i didn't want to size down much more than a small), 5'6' and 12other and i'm drowning in this. i'm going to try it with different bottoms and ultimately will keep it because i do love the quality. just size down a couple of sizes!!
other Very pretty & shimmery. suitable for slightly dressier occasions. comfortable fit.
other When i was purchasing this i asked to myself "do i really need another black jacket". when it arrived i realized that this is not just another black jacket. this jacket is special. it is light weight - but structured. it is the perfect length and the fabric feels amazing. this jacket is my new favorite.
3 This coat is so lovely, it is the embodiment of 1940's classic movie star style. the color, the style, the collar add a subtle flair of drama that you definitely want in your wardrobe .... if only it weren't for those pesky buttons!like other reviewers, i am disappointed to note that within a month of owning, the top button popped off in the middle of a dinner date on a rainy night in a french restaurant. that same night, i noticed a button was missing from one of the sleeves. alas, i am as yet
other I immediately picked out this in the taupe color at the store. the black was pretty basic looking, but this color is gorgeous. it's quite flowy on me (i wear an xs/s most places but usually small in tops here) the sleeves stretched out a bit after a day of teaching too. one of my favorite tops at retailer right now!
other Great summer skort! these are exactly what i have been looking for to wear to the carribean! the material is substantial but not enough to be hot nor too little to be called thin. the skort is constructed well with nice flow between the skirt and short portion which is sometimes a miss with other skorts i have tried on. it does run slightly large. i also sized down after initially trying on the one in the photo.
other I just received these denim joggers. this is my first pair of denim joggers and they are absolutely stunning. i like the decorative band. i do feel as these will be a staple in my wardrobe. the possibilities with these joggers are endless.
other I love this dress. the pattern/print is very different than most of the dresses i own. i'm 5'1" 106lbs and the 0p fit perfectly. it's a delicate dress. its very fitted in the skirt portion. the top is more of a knit fabric that has some give to it.
other The quality of he fabric is amazing. the thickness is perfect as to look form fitting while not too tight or thin showing any "wrinkles." i had been searching for a versatile turtleneck i could dress up or down a finding this was a definite win! the style is timeless and with the high quality i know this will be a staple for years to come.
other This top is my new favorite. i ordered it on a whim, and oh boy am i glad!! i was so excited for it to be shipped to me, and once it arrived i couldn't wait to put it. once i put it on, i couldn't wait to show it off! it is such a great bluish-grayish color and looks great with some big hoop earrings, shorts, and sandals. such an easy, classic, simple shirt that i will probably wear too much.
other I was attracted to the feminine design of the dress, the silhouette, the flouncy skirt; however, i ordered the red motif pattern and hated the splotchy, dark colors.
other Very soft and luxe materials and really well made. pockets a nice detail and otherwise a great cut and length. petticoat underneath a cool detail too.
other Love this dress! it's exactly as pictured and the fabric design is so pretty. will look great with a cardigan for fall but also will look nice for summer with the cutout in the back. nice too that it has a detachable slip.
3 This was too big in the arms & i didn't like how there was only one button toward the top so that it made your body look hippy. little too itchy too. best thing about it was the look of the slouchy collar.
other This jacket isn't as structures as i thought but it is very comfortable. runs true to size and feels nice. i am looking forward to wearing this in the fall
other This dress is quite lovely, but there are a few things to know:the blue color is much more of a dark teal, with more of a dull green tinge than i expected. still pretty, but definitely not a pure blue. i loved the look of the blue online, but i think the pink might have worked a little better with my coloring.the dress is a bit low in front. not inappropriately low, but if you are hoping to be able to "adjust" by pulling the shoulders back a bit or something, be aware that the bodice drapi
other Just received this top in the mail & purchased at the sale price. beautiful classic piece that can easily be dressed up or down. excellent quality & fits tts. for reference, i'm 5'5, 120lbs & ordered the sp & xs, i kept the xs. the sp had an elastic waist, there was no drawstring. not sure if this applies to all petite sizes or just the one i received.
other I was wavering on this post purchase but then decided to wear it to a store opening event and double digit people asked me where i got it or commented that they liked it. i guess i made the right decision! the inside is a super soft gray jersey knit. wears great with black.
other I feel like this brand is very good at coming up with dresses that are flattering and i feel like they tend to fit my body well. i like the design of the dress a lot because it makes me feel like i am walking along with beach-it gets me in the mood for summer, and it is the perfect casual everyday dress for the summer. i love that the color scheme is understated which reinforces that this could be warn anywhere-even for everyday use. the strips are perfect for the look of this dress, and i don't
other Dress is silk? it's soft and pretty. it's blue so you can wear brown or blue suede boots!i caught my reflection a few times and thought i looked really bottom heavy. dress is awesome. worth it.
other Not as cute as photos, and too small in chest. i am 5'5'', 12other lbs, and the small was too tight in the chest, and i am not large here at all. shoulders and sleeve length fit well. will return. not comfortable, and will need to be able to button it on rainy days.
other These are a perfect staple piece: you can dress them up or down, and they're insanely comfortable! even if you hold a lot of your weight in your butt and thighs like i do, i feel like these pants do such a nice job of being form-fitting and flattering without squeezing the life out of you. i have always loved any and all retailer pants in this style, because they just fit so well and last a really long time. i will continue to buy these for many, many years!
other I absolutely love this sweater and the color is beautiful! i read through the reviews and purchased a medium as i read that this sweater ran large - i'm very happy i sized down.i haven't yet worn it and hope that it does stay off the shoulder, as pictured, without having to constantly re-arrange.great sale price!
other This dress has potential, but it didn't work for me. it runs true to size to a little big, i ordered medium, my usual size for maeve). as for length it fit me as the model (5'9"). the reason i'm not keeping it is that i wish it had some darts in the back to help define the waist a bit,
other Every spring/summer i look forward to t.la's tanks & tees and stock up on them. sometimes it is difficult to determine the color online, but this top (i bought it in green) is without a doubt the same color in person as it is online. the color is a gorgeous sea green and the softest cotton tee (just keeps getting softer wash after wash) and the silver buttons on the side (what a unique twist to an everyday tee). now all i need is the blue one.
other These culottes are adorable on....if you order up two whole sizes! they run extremely small. fabric is thick, high quality and a beautiful color.
other I wanted this coat from the first moment i saw it in the catalogue. i tend to gravitate toward dark colors, but this looked timeless and beautiful, like something my grandmother would have cherished (and i would have coveted). i was not disappointed. the coat is carefully lined, and the mohair is divinely soft. the silhouette is not fitted, but comes off surprisingly chic. do note that this is not a coat for heavy duty weather; i've even been a bit chilly wearing it at nights in la. also, heed t
other I sized down in this dress from a 6 to a other (32d-31-38). the 6 was too blousy in the bust and it did feel "sack-like". i sized down and suddenly it looked great--fitted enough through the bust and hips. be warned--this dress has to be pulled over your head. the fit in the bust will determine a lot. i am tall--almost 5' 9" and the length was great--similar to the model in the photo. the cream and black print is gorgeous.
other This dress is completely versatile and great to wear as is or add a vest or chunky sweater for a layer. i bought it late last week and love the fit and comfort of the jersey knit fabric. also, you can't beat the price for an retailer dress!
other I am 5' 4" and 120 lbs. i bought the xs as my frame is a bit on the smaller side, but the cut is huge. a pregnant woman could easily pull this off as a very cool maternity dress. i can see it being so cute with a pair of boots or sandals. i wanted to get the xxs, but it's sold out so sadly will have to send it back. but if it works for you, definitely buy it!
other Pretty design, but when i tried it on, the fabric was thin and delicate. i don't think it would last long with much wear. too bad. if the fabric were sturdier, it'd be great as the cut is flattering and i love the pockets.
3 I got this shirt and loved it so much the first time i wore it. it swings well and is an easy basic that looks great. however, after i washed it the first time, it became clingy and stuck to me and doesn't lie right. it's such a shame because i was thrilled with this as an addition to my wardrobe!
3 Very boxy top, not flattering on. i will be returning.
other So soft. this is the best basic tee i've bought in a long time and it fits so nicely on my frame. i'm 5'8" ans 130 lb, medium bust and got an xs.
other I wanted to love this jumpsuit. it looks adorable in the product photo. i am 5'5" about 120lbs and thus was overwhelming on me. i tried everything--- pulling up the tie at the waist to create a higher line, wearing a variety of heel heights----i couldn't seem to make it work. there was just so much fabric on me! it felt like i was wearing pajamas (and not in a cute 'wear your pajamas out' way). i love the idea and the photo appears to have an adorable line and cut. on me, this jumpsuit was just
other I love the weight and drape of this vest; it adds a finished touch to even the simplest t shirts. i plan on wearing it into the cooler months of fall. however, it runs a week bit small across the bust. i normally wear a medium at retailer but large would have been a better fit. sadly the large vest in the dark blue was sold out.
other This is a great dress from moving to summer into fall. it's great right now with the warm temps, but a throw on a jacket and some booties and you have a fall outfit. it's very comfortable also. there is a slip underneath which is what you see with the buttons open in the front. i wish the slip was a little longer and the dress is see through. maybe, you can adjust it at the straps some. at any rate, it's a nice dress and i'm keeping it.
other This is a great cover-up or tunic over leggings or capris. i am other foot two and it comes to my knee
other No need to be on the fence about this top, it's lovely! what you see pictured here, is exactly what you get, even the color of the top is 100% accurate. for reference i'm usually an xl/16, apple shape, 40 c bust, and this xl does not cling at all to me, so you may even be able to size down. the drape of the clipdot fabric is flattering, and thick enough not to need a cami. all of the fabrics used are nice and soft... and the details! it's going to be a beautiful spring!
other I loved this top when i tried it on. i'm usually a small or medium and ordered the medium based on these reviews. the only problem with this for me was that you can see through it in the back. it showed every lump and bump around my bra. reluctantly, i am going to return it. if you don't have any lumps and bumps i think this is a great top. i wish it had worked for me. i debated about trying it on with a camisole to see if that would help, but don't really want to have to wear a camisole in the
other Got these on sale...absolutely love eberjey! fabric is super soft and easy to wash. more "normal" than other eberjey styles (not lingerie). i'm 5'6", 12other lbs and small fit well. i am small busted and there is definitely extra room but doesn't make it fit weird at all. highly recommend!
3 I purchased this shirt online. i thought it would be perfect for work, but when i tried it on, i couldn't even button half the buttons. it is also extremely see-through, and even a nude or white cami underneath would look really odd. need to return, unfortunately. if the top came in other colors, i would return for a larger size, but i can't deal with see-through work tops.
other This sweater is so soft, beautiful and well made. it runs just a bit large, but i love the look.
other I love this skirt! fits like a dream, fabric is soft, light, and drapes perfectly. i bought the skewed pullover to wear with it and the colors are perfect. my new favorite summer outfit.
other This dress is so versatile. great summer wear!
other This is a great dress!  very different and light but cute details
other This material is a nice quality but the shirt is boxy and shapeless. it was not flattering at all on my shape. i don't think it would look nice on anyone with an hourglass shape or fuller chest.
other I'm short, only 5ft and this is beautiful and flowy. it's just below my knees and i think it's perfect. i have only worn it twice out and literally everywhere i went i received a compliment, and asking where i got it. it's unique and no one else carries one like this. i know some customers mentioned the price being a bit high but i disagree. i would rather pay for something that i love, that has good design and quality instead of 50 or 60 for a so so product. that's what i love about retailerpolog
other This is a cute top but a little pricey for cotton t shirt material. the arms and shoulders/armpit feel a little tight but is loose and flowy below the bust. it is not as dressy in person as it appears in the photos. a cute top for jeans or leggings as the length falls below the hip.
other This tee is my favorite this year! it just looks great on! not fitted, but not loose either. i love it so much i have it in white, black, pink, light green, gray, slate blue and holly. the holly was my least favorite color (i thought it would look a little 'greener') it is so dark, you almost have to see it in the sunlight to be sure it is green. i ordered it online from the store and i kept it just because...i love the fact that it can be machine warned and dried without shrinking. i don't dr
other These jeans are so soft! fit is great and i love he higher waist as well. i can tell i will be wearing the heck out of these.
other The fit on this is so strange. the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift. the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price. the cups are padded, which is nice i suppose, but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i'm guessing. i'm a 32dd, size 8 in pants, and size 4/6 in dresses and i ordered a medium. i also have a long torso, which probably didn't help.
other This top fits perfect everywhere except the sleeves are a little tight. not uncomfortably so but i wish they had just a little more room so they looked like they did in the picture. other than that, i love this shirt! its super cute and comfy and i have gotten a few compliments on it!
other I was looking for a navy top to replace an overused navy silk cowlneck that i have been wearing for years. this is perfect. light, versatile and classic.
3 This runs a little big and falls off the shoulders a bit. i didn't like it as much as i had hoped.
3 This sweater caught my eye and the positive reviews and pre-holiday sale had me try it. loved the color and cut but surprisingly not the embroidery. i felt like i'd wear it a couple of times and then tire of it. my husband and daughter both said, "meh," so back it went.
other Nice piece. the fabric is very stretchy with that heavy luxe kind of feeling. the neck snap placket is genius because when it is snapped up the neck stays up without restricting the throat. nice long lenght too.
other This is way cuter in person than on model. it is a super soft and fluffy sweater. the colors are so pretty and feminine. i received it as a christmas gift and have already worn it twice. it's perfect with skinny jeans and ugg boots. i vary between xs and small in retailer sweaters. this is a bit boxy so i sized down with the xs and it fits perfect!
other I ordered the copper in a medium which i felt was tts (5'4" 145). the color is beautiful and i love the buttons on the shoulders which i really didn't notice in the picture, the material is also very soft. but i have some complaints.. first i felt that the material, while soft, was not very substantial for the price. i purchased another vest from that store that has everything which was $100 less and seems to be the same quality. i also was expecting there to be some way to close the vest beside
other An easy top that adds instant glamour. the burnout velvet is super fun for the holidays and yet the design is comfortable and easy. i have found this top can work day and night with the right accessories.
other I did not try this on alone but rather with a long sleeve white tee and white button down shirt. i really liked both looks. if i find it to be itchy like the other review i will have to return. this is an effortless fashion statement yet it could easily be a weekender cozy staple. my only complaint is why two neutral colors? this would have been great if offered in a richer darker yarn. the two offered colors are so similar and both looked drab against my skin tone.
other This top is very pretty and you can definitely wear it without a cami with a nude bra if you're an outgoing person, especially for a summer evening. my only confusion is the too high neckline. if it was just a little lower, it would look and feel less "chokey." i keep wanting to pull it down. i'm a size 0 and needed the xxs which fits like most people's xs's as sizing continues to get bigger. really lovely except for the neckline. looks great over white or colored shorts and is a nice mix of cas
other I loved this blouses when i saw it on-line, but when i saw it in on me it looked totally different. it runs really large and i didn't like the material of blouse.
other A cute dress, though waist a little too high (more of an empire waist... hitting at widest part of rib cage). this looks like it should be a stretchy knit dress, but the detailing has no give whatsoever and the dress runs quite small. i usually wear a 00, but though i could get it zipped, it wasn't comfortable, and if i want to keep it, i'll need to size up to a 0. i'm 5'6", 32b-24-35.
other Got this shirt on sale and i hope they restock so i can buy more. super comfy and flattering at the same time. i have some extra baby weight and it camouflages that well. i'm normally a 6-8 but i'm an 8-10 right now and the medium was perfect. i'm 5'6" and its plenty long enough to wear with leggings. a great shirt and i'll be sure to watch out for this one to come back. please restock!
other I was looking for a layering piece to go over leggings or skinny jean to cover my backside. i really like this swingy top. i agree that it does run large but i was looking for something flowy so i love it. the cream is a litttle more sheer than i expected so i'm wearing a cami underneath. maybe being taller 5' 8" helps it not seem so much like a tent. well made and just what i thought it would be from the website model photo. (i used a 20% coupon so help easy the pain of the price of this top -
3 Not keeping this one. the fabric is a bit tacky-looking in person, the cut is odd and it's just not me. fit is fine and there are snaps to keep the neckline flat and shaped, the colors are as shown and it is a good length (falls to top of hip). i simply did not like it. too metallic looking maybe...
other Love these pants! i'm 5'10 and the length is perfect. could even wear a little heel. the fold over waist is so comfy, they feel like pajamas but look very classy. i bought the navy and silver (more of a khaki color) on sale for a great deal. the washing instructions say line dry but i threw them in the dryer on low and they came out fine. just need to remove and hang quickly for less wrinkles.
other This pair of flare is just what i have been searching for. the color is a nice vintage blue. i love the fit of the flare however please keep in mind these do run long and larger that size.
3 The wine color is beautiful, and the idea of a knot front with different back is a good one. however, both fabrics are thin, and the back is quite see through. the knit shows every single bodily imperfection. so, if you are the quintessential tall and thin, and you don't mind showing your bra, go for it! otherwise, i suggest skipping this one.
other I saw this on a mannequin at the store and was instantly drawn in by all the beautiful blue lace and the overall design. however, when i tried it on, i personally found a few things that just didn't work for me:____________pros:- blue lace is lovely throughout, nicely done.- there's a little snap closure at the front of the dress where the fabric overlaps at the bra cups. i can only assume it's to make it easier to get the dress on. it's a nice little detail, although not sure if really
3 I was hopeful my size l would fit after another pair of leggings from antrho in this order was too small. these went on easier and i was feeling good until i reached the lower abdomen and everything came to a screeching halt. i'm not sure they are too small, rather, i believe, they are styled to be low-rise. not sure why anyone would want that in a legging, but i'm new to this athletic-wear trend. regardless, i won't be wearing these!
other Like most people here, i wanted this beautiful dress to fit. so, i decided to see for myself if maybe, just maybe the negative reviews were wrong. they weren't. if you have any sort of breasts at all, the top probably won't fit properly. i imagine a narrow upper torso, like a 3other or 33, possibly a 3other might find the top part of the dress closes properly, but with a 36 c, i could not get a size 1other to button up. the waist hit at a strange spot, and despite the picture showing a narrow waist and grad
3 I bought these for a trip to the caribbean. i sweat a lot. if you have ever been humiliated by having a ring of sweat around your crotch area, then i do not recommend these shorts in the moss color. this color and fabric do not camouflage sweat. i will spare you the photos.
3 This spandex top, in my opinion, is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive, but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is, it should fit like this. 5' 5" 14other lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but, as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.
other I loved this jacket when i tried it on in the store, and brought home a size med. it's a nice weight of material, lined, and very classy. i liked the idea of adding it to my collection of suit-jackets for business meetings. but when i tried it on again using actual outfits from my closet, i realized how much it looked like a lab-coat. i am not giving up-- if it goes on sale, i'll order a small, to see if it is more flattering. but at this point, it's a no-go.
other I've been eyeing this for months and finally bit the bullet and am so happy i did before it sold out! i love it. i was afraid i couldn't pull it off because i'm 5'3 and very petite, but i don't think it matters. it feels so light and airy and i can't wait to wear it at the pool and the beach as well as over some white tank tops and jean shorts. great piece.
other This jacket was a little shorter than i had expected, but i still really enjoy the cut and fit of it.
other I stumbled upon this as a return to our store. at first, i was a little put off by the change in stitching to add support and shape. but once you put it on, it's perfect. it's very flattering and very comfortable. there are snaps in the crotch, but i wore it for a full day (8+ hours) and had no discomfort. if there were more colors, i'd buy them all lol.
other I am totally in love with this sweater!! it is lightweight, comfortable, and very versatile. throw on a pair of jeans and it is casual. throw on dark slacks or a skirt and it is dressy. the design does not become the focus of the sweater but rather takes it up a notch making it a fun piece to wear. the color is not a light red, but rather a rich cabernet wine color. this sweater is well on its way to becoming one of my all time favorites!!
other After reading the reviews i sized down to a 6. once i received it, i loved the fabric and color, however it was so ill-fitting. it's like the designer didn't even use female measurements and used a box to make this top--too wide. i liked it so much that i sized way down to a 0 and it still fit horribly. it is too wide and not long enough. both are going back!
other This is beautiful on. it flatters the figure nicely. the material is a rougher cotton which seems oppressive for summer even though thin. it is very low cut but it looks wonderful.
other This top was surprisingly very flattering. it hugged my curves in just the right way and the slits on the side are a nice touch. i'm 5'2" and about a 34c and the xs was tight (in a good way) around my chest and then more flowy after. soft material and the red color is beautiful!
other I love this jacket! works so well with business casual outfits, and the color goes with almost everything! great over blouses or t shirts. by far my favorite purchase in quite a while!
other These pants are very, very cute and high quality. they can be worn with a variety of colors and can be dressed up or down. they are also very flattering. i definitely recommend sizing up as they run small. my normal size was a tad tight in the waist and there is very little stretch - but the next size up was perfect.
other Great top for in between seasons. comfy/soft/roomy. fyi - the pattern has tiny holes that will show through - i.e., bra, skin, etc.
other Super flattering! stretch a little with repeated wear but not as much as other pairs. i love these!!!
other I already have some dresses similar to this, but i couldn't help getting this one, too. i love the flowers, bees, and ladybugs on the print! there is some shimmery beading on the neck and a few spots. i think i can wear this at work with the right cardigan/jacket, so i'll get more use out of it. it's a lovely light, floaty fabric that's nice for warmer weather.
other I was returning an in line order from same designer and saw this dress. i love it. much prettier in person. this will get well worn by me!
other Just bought this and am in love with it. it's a really nice weight - light for spring. the drape-y fit is very flattering. it's longer in the back than in the front and has a nice swing to it. can't wait to wear it!i tried on the tee in the lighter color and didn't care for it much - i liked the contrast of the black and silver stripes.
other Super soft and comfortable. runs a little large. very cozy.
other I bought this top in black. it is high quality material and i love the mock neck and zipper in back.  however, not only are the armholes are too large, the shirt is cut too short. if i size down for smaller armholes, it becomes a crop top, not a flattering look for 50-something me. i really wanted this to work, but alas, it went back.
other This is a beautiful color and nice heavier fabric. love the style. armholes not too big. the body is loose fitting at torso but chest area is fitted at 36 c size small . i love this top with skinny jeans or pencil skirt as shown on model. top looks just like it does on model as far as fit.
other I love the shirt and it runs true to size everywhere but the arm holes. i bought a size small and the length was great, the fit was great, but the arm holes were gappy and big. i had to return it and was bummed because i loved it otherwise.
3 I love the colors in this top, but sadly i'm going to have to return it. the first thing my husband did when he saw this on me was just stare, and not in a good way. then he said it looked like a maternity top. i was so disappointed, and sadly will be returning this. for reference, i am 13other pounds. 5-ft. 4-in tall and do not want to look pregnant in a top. i normally wear size medium tops, but this one is huge. now i know why the model in the picture had her arms nestled in at her sides. this to
other This is adorable! i got it to wear on the plane for an upcoming vacation. this is definitely tts. i am normally a medium and got the medium. i am long wasted and this fit just fine. looks like it does on the model.the material is super soft too. it is also easy to get on and off which is sometimes difficult with rompers.plan on wearing it with gladiator sandals and a jean jacket.
other For me this had too much material and was a little too tent like. a beautiful dress but not my style. i prefer more a line with not so much material.if you are looking for something roomy this is a good choice.
other This is a great summer staple tank! i first ordered it in black + white, and i'm now ordering the coral + navy. i'm usually a petite xs (i have a short torso), but seeing the length on this tank, i went with the regular and glad i did. also, i had previously bought the filigree lace tank (same brand), and the length of the petite on that tank is the same as this tank's regular length, so i knew it'd fit perfectly.
other The pattern is cute and vibrant, and the shillouette is simple, but the courderoy felt too heavy and stiff and it was too small around the chest for me (36dd).
other Really love it - soft and nice quality - only complaint is the straps are too long for a normal sized torso. the front drapes below my breasts at the tightest /smallest setting.
other This dress is made well and fit nice. i am 64" and 13other lbs. i really wanted it keep it but it is going back. the colors in person are much more muted and with my pale blonde hair and fair skin the color was all wrong.
other This must be the only structured t shirt at retailer at the time of this review. i love it. the neckline is perfection. the ruched sleeves are long enough to cover my upper arms. i found it a bit see through, and added a white cami.sizing: i ordered an xs. normally i wear a small in retailer brands, and a med in most other brands. size small t's have been too large lately. i'm 5'5" tall, 13other lbs, 35-29-36, 34d, long torso, narrow across the shoulders, and short arms. fit: loose fitting t's l
other This is a very sexy suit. it took some time to figure out how to put it on. it needs instructions, but it is well worth it.
3 This is a truly beautiful dress, and yes, so much better in person.  upon examining the dress, however, i saw some problems.  the embroidery above the waistline was loose in places, there were some frayed ends, and even some &#39;fuzzy&#39; spots where it looked like the stitching had rubbed against something.  the dress is over $250, and for that price i expect the embroidery to be top-notch.  returning and hope the replacement is in better shape.  if so, it will be a keeper!
other This sweater/coat is great. it super comfortable. it's perfect for my california winters! it could be layered for colder areas. this piece definitely runs large- like really large. i went with an xs instead of my usual small or medium. it is meant to be boxy, and still is but sizing down allowed for it to be more flattering. i'd definitely say go in store and try it on, you'll love it!
other This top is really cute - a light sweater with a feminine lace detail. i would recommend it if you're looking for a flowy, feminine top to wear before it gets really cold out. the only reason i didn't give it other stars is because the material is a little prone to pulls and snags. i wore it once and got a pull from my cross body bag. thankfully, i was able to manipulate the threading and the pull is almost unnoticeable. but just know that it's a pretty delicate sweater and you'll have to be careful
other I thought this dress was lovely on. i'm an 8/10 and tried the med which i believe was the right fit. it may have fit a little large but i liked the way it hung. it has pockets and the color is absolutely beautiful. definitely buying if it makes it to sale.
other For anyone who loves lace. it fits pretty true to size. the size m length hits just to the top of the knee. i' 5' 4" tall. to lighten up the dress just a little so that it does not look as some have said "frumpy" i hemmed the liner so that the liner hem is half way up on the ruffle. this makes the dress look less heavy, more fun, and repeats the openness of the lace on top. love this dress! will be wore a lot for summer evenings out.
3 This may be lovely on some people but it didn't work on me at all. i thought it would have some swing to it but the bottom hem was tight. if i had gone up a size, the top would have been huge. the bib wasn't flattering on me and it's also quite sheer. too bad because the print is great. maybe if you're athletic with slim hips you can manage it. i think if you are busty this could look like maternity wear on you. back it went, sadly.
other My retailer location only had the blue option, which i found to be very appealing and better in person for the following reasons:__________pros:- lighter knit like others mentioned.- the blue is a deep blue with threads of shimmery black that give it a more elegant touch while still being casual. i didn't see the grey, so i cannot compare the two differences, but i found the blue color lovely.- this looks much better in person!- it sat well on my tall frame of 5'9", 36 c, wide hips, and hour
other I love the look on this dress - feels great for a romantic night out or for a party.
other This was really big on me. i am usually a 10 and even the 8 wouldn't stay up around the chest. i would need to have straps sewn on to make this work. on the plus side, the material is absolutely gorgeous. rich, saturated color. too bad about the fit. maybe really busty girls will have better luck, but this is going back. too expensive to justify keeping it if i need to spend money having it remade/tailored.
other Loved the design and legnth but the material was not a light and soft as i expected.  i would get this in another fabric.
other Quality is excellent. i agree with another reviewer that the top runs large. i am usually a medium, but i was swimming in it. i live in alaska and would not know how to return it so i am just keeping it and wearing it on those cool lazy days. i'm sure it would still look classy because of the design.
other I have the "charisma sheath" by the same designer and love it so much i thought i'd try this one. looks so much better in person than in the picture. it's extremely flattering on my curve less frame. whenever i wear it to work, i get stopped and asked where i got it. great dress, you'll love it more in real life!
other I love this dress, is perfect in every way. no complaints. very pretty colors. will wear it with a belt.
other Fabulous dress for both quality and design. the embroidery is gorgeous and the long sleeves make it practical to begin wearing immediately. true to size and flattering. looks darling with booties.
other Wow this dress is very flattering! i have a fairly small waist and not-so-small hips and this dress is slimming. it is also soft, light, airy, gorgeous! exactly what you need on a beautiful spring day! i wore this dress yesterday and have not felt that beautiful in a very long time! thank you so much retailer for the brilliant design:)
3 I am a huge pilcro fan. however, these were beyond large. i am not even sure that the next size down would work. keep this in mind if you attempt these pants.
other Love this dress. sooo comfortable and flattering. i typically wear a 4-6 in dresses or can be between small and medium depending on style and cut. i went with xs on this dress and it's still very comfortable and loose fitting. the small size fit fine but seemed like too much fabric on the skirt.
other The colors are so pretty, a pinkish brown and a light brown trim. it is very soft and elegant looking. great with jeans or leggings. the tie is a little high in back but looks great. highly recommend!
other Great dress! i am always looking for knee length dresses that are comfortable and easy to wear. i am really active with my kids and this dress can be worn on a casual day with sandals or dressed up. the fit was flattering for me, although i am not very curvy and could see that it might not flatter all shapes. i am 5'5'' and 120 pounds and the size four fit great.
other This tee is very comfortable and the colors are amazing! i initially purchased in the marigold yellow as i was instantly drawn to the color in store. it's a beautiful shade that will transition nicely into fall. i've since purchased the green which i liked on even more so than on the rack. overall, a nice quality everyday tee. the pocket and embroidered neck make it something retailer!!
3 These jeans fit perfectly. however, the distress at the knee was a bit too distressed for my taste. i would recommend these jeans for a younger demographic.
3 I wear a size other and i ordered the small for this top. it is huge and gave me a maternity-look that i wasn't going for. i was hoping for a loose, body-skimming fit as shown on the model in the picture but that wasn't happening with this top.
other Love the fit and feel of these. and super stylish too. i want in more colors if i can get it.
other Overall, i was pleased with this dress. i didn't love how the front wrap transitioned to the back. it is comfortable and versatile... it can be dressed up or down.
other I was really excited about this top since i have others from retailer that are similar in styling. unfortunately, it just didn't work out. i am petite with a short torso and ordered my usual size and it was way too short in the front. the top was also boxy and didn't sit right. it just wasn't flattering. cute top on the hanger, but just not on me.
other Straight out of the mail, this cozy soft adorable charming sweater was *full* of little pills. i love the embroidery, the swingy slightly oversized fit that doesn't overwhelm and the high snuggle factor. wish this came in other colors and was knitted with a less fussy yarn.
other I saw this on the rack, and tried it on because it was just so beautiful. the beading and embroidery details are unlike any piece of clothing i've seen in a ready-to-wear store. it feels and wears much more like a couture piece.i wasn't planning on making such a big purchase, but it's just so beautiful i had to have it. i doubt i'll find another item of such quality and craftsmanship for the price.runs large- i'm normally a size 6 (135lbs) and the size other fit perfectly.
other I ordered this dress, along with several others, for an upcoming wedding. this was my favorite of all of them as far as style; unfortunately it just didn't fit. i'm 5'2" 116lbs and my regular size other was slightly too long, the waist a bit too low, the shoulders a tad too wide. as a result it hung on me like on a hanger. i guess i would need a petite but alas does not appear to come petite...
other The picture doesn't do this blouse any justice. the fabric is really nice and the back is really what makes this blouse. the bows down the back of the blouse make it pop!
other This shirt is way too flowy and the pink color is extremely washed out- will definitely be returning!
other Love this top-i love the colors, flow and that you can wear with a regular bra and straps are covered. i was torn between the xs and s but went with the s due to length. have already worn several times with a casual white jean summer skirt and crops. love love love.
other Tts and very feminine and flattering. looks same as on model. love this style. if you like style highly recommend . armholes not too big- yay!
3 I'm normally between a 4-6 in retailer dresses. i had to go up to a size 10 just to get the buttons across the chest to close and lay properly without feeling like i would bust out. definitely not for those with any kind of chest.
other I really like this dress. it is cute, but not too frilly. i purchased in the store and they only had a petite (i am 5'6", so not a petite), but it fit - a little short but not too crazy. can be dressed up or down. the material and the print are really lovely.
other I love this tank top - it is perfect for work and dressing up a more casual outfit. the fact that it has small cutouts is cute and doesn't make it so you absolutely have to wear a tank under it in more casual situations. i love the colors and the boxy fit. great purchase!
other I love this top! the color is quite unique (a reddish color), but the cut really makes it stand out. i love the square neckline. i feel it accentuates my bust without showing too must breast. i notice a number of other reviewers had an issue with the tightness around the bust: this top looks like it would have ample stretch in the photograph; however, in person you can see that the embroidered area does not have any stretch. for me, this was not an issue, as the top suited my body type well rega
other I'm a 34c and 136 lbs. the dress falls just below my knees, perfect for the colder weather! i bought this in m in two colors because i love it so much! the fit is so flattering and the material is so soft and comfortable. i continue to find maeve dresses classic, quality, flattering and comfortable!
other Amazing dress! i'm a pear shape, and this dress is a very complimentary cut for me. it's also not too short. the color print on the dress are amazing. i'm very happy!
3 I thought these would be nice, and they are but then i started thinking that the bejewels will eventually be out of style and these can't be as much of a classic... also, the jewels make the jeans feel heavier. fit is like most boyfriend/girlfriend jeans, slightly loose (not as much on me due to muscles) and length on petite was close to what is shown here (typical for me that it is still a bit longer, as not only am i short, but i have short legs for my shortness!)so if you want that styl
other This dress is extremely comfortable and easy to wear with a bra. the back is great and the length is perfect for me. it's flattering, but the pattern (being light in color across the middle) isn't particularly flattering on your waist. that being said though, the gathering in front is great for hiding bumps and whatnot (after 3 kids that's important to me). lightweight and great for summer. 5'8", 135lbs and the size s fit perfectly.
3 Loved the grey color and the design but the shirt ran huge. i ordered a other and it fit me like an extra large. i am 5'2" about 110 pounds and not flat chested.
other I got this in a petite xs; it's gorgeous and incredibly soft, great quality as well. my one little caveat is that it's very short; i'm 5'other with a short torso and it still didn't get very far on me, but if you wear it with high-waited pants/skirt it's not a big deal
other I'm 5'4" 12other lbs ordered small. fits perfect. super soft denim. love the color love the worn in feel
other I like this sweater. i am 5'4", 12other lbs, and bought the xs. if i had to do it again, i'd buy the xxs. for a fitted cardigan it ran slightly big. it's a thin material- you would layer it over a tank or tee.
other What a cute swing sweater and so easy to layer. this jacket looks great snapped or left open and the collar and hood leave such a soft look around your neck. this has such great elements of cozy and warmth just in time for cool weather!
other These fox tights are so very cute and fun! how can you not smile when wearing these tights designed with the cutest foxes all over! they are warm too! these go great under dresses or tunics and i always get compliments when wearing them! they are a real attention getter!
other I love the design of this blouse. lots of pretty details. the slits on the side are high, but with a tank underneath, it's perfect. love the length of the sleeves and the modest, flattering neckline. the only problems so far are that the rhinestones are prone to falling out and snagging other parts of the top, so you have to be careful with movements and you can't wear a sweater with it because the rhinestones would snag it a lot. even if it loses the rhinestones, it's still a beautiful blouse,
other This sweater is thicker than some of the other cashmere sweaters i purchased at retailer this year. it is made with high quality cashmere as it is extremely soft. i wouldn't describe it as chunky or bulky though. it's probably made of at least other or maybe even 3 ply cashmere. the sleeves do run slightly short. i purchased the xs and it fits my petite frame perfectly! grab it while you can! it's so luxurious & super warm for the winter.
other I just wore this dress tonight to my holiday party and received many compliments on it. it's so comfortable and even though the fabric is thick, it's not bulky or stiff like some embroidered fabric can be. and the side pockets make a great addition too. unlike other reviews, i thought the armholes were perfect. the cutout in the back is a nice touch, and i was able to wear a regular bra with it. the colors are beautiful and true to the pic, i was not surprised by the "brightness" of it like othe
other This skirt is absolutely beautiful. the design and organza are so feminine, and i love the length. it flows beautifully and it isn't stiff or anything, but it does hold its shape well. i ordered it through the store, and the wrinkles came out easily after it hung for several days. i think it would be easy to snag the material, so i will be really careful when i'm wearing it. the zipper is a little hard to pull all the way to the top of the skirt, and i worry a little about the hook and eye closu
other I usually wear a medium but in this top probably could have pulled off a small however i was afraid the neck would be too tight.  was considering the small because the arm holes were a bit baggier than i would like.  no issue with my bra showing though.  i wasn't able to try on the small to test my theory since i purchased online.  overall i love the color (blue), the fabric is comfortable, definitely loose but i'm okay with that on a hot sunny day.
other Ordered the pink in a small, but it ran big...the xs was perfect for my 5'6' medium frame. it is comfortable and the fabric has an interesting texture. looks great with chinos or jeans. might need to get the other color.
other Flowing top that looks great with skinny slacks... makes a great and comfortable work outfit.
other Love these pants, they do run small in the hip area and are not stretchy at all. so beware, if you are curvy, you might want to size up. great quality and style overall.
other And runs large. i'm always a size 8 in dresses and the 8 was too big. i would buy it in a 6 if the color was closer to what i'm seeing online.
other Loved the one i had in white so much i ordered the green - such a beautiful piece! size seems true to size, and it elevates anything you wear it with; skirt, jeans, shorts....if you are on the fence, jump- you won't be disappointed.
other I'm so pleased with this cropped chino with all its lovely colors. i have bought 3 colors so far and i love the fit and comfort of these. i'm 5"1, 10other pounds and took the 24p since this runs a size large. my favorite is the lovely moss color which really a brighter mint green and i also love the honey color for spring and summer. these fit slightly slim yet still feel relaxed. love them and highly recommend these!
other Beautiful and classy- i love this! i'm 5'8"/125lbs/34b and my usual xs works great (could probably also have worn a s). i was a little worried it'd be scratchy and/or too structured, but it's soft and flattering. photos are accurate. would definitely recommend!
other Love this shawl/wrap! was looking to purchase the white & warren cashmere poncho (but available online only), and then saw this in the store. tried it on and fell in love. love that it's 100% cashmere -- super soft and warm. would recommend!
other But tight around the chest, i ordered xs petite after trying on xxs petite and both are a tad tight on the chest area, kept xs petites as bigger would be too much fabric everywhere else. green color is classic, and the back is longer than the front. overall flattering if with the right outfit. i'm 30 dd and 11other lbs for reference.
other This is one of the cutest tops i've ever gotten from retailer. the material is very soft and flowing. it fits true to size and hange beautifully. love it. i should have gotten he turquoise one too!
other I bought this a month ago and returned it. but kept thinking about it so ordered it. it arrived on wed and i wore it on thursday as a dress with tights. i got so many compliments on it. it was perfect for the cool weather and was not too warm.this knitter thinks the quality of the jacquard knit is excellent. yarn used is top notch.
other Purchased this today at my local retailer-been eyeing it a while-thinking i would wait until on sale-until the salesgirl whom i know said it was their second shipment and all have sold out. knew i needed to splurge. i tried on the small and x small and wound up going for the small. i did however try on 3 smalls and two of them were way to roomy, but the third one fit like a charm-it was quite a bit slimmer in body than the two smalls, strange but true. i do have room in it-i am a 3other c to 36 b and
other Buy these, they are a keeper. sturdy fabric, not too thin and they do not sag or stretch after wearing (i tested them before taking the tag off by sitting in them on my couch for several hours). comfy, soft fabric. i will be ordering other colors, hoping that black will be available.
other This runs super big and it just wasn't flattering--way too much fabric. i wanted to love this dress.
other This top is so soft i want to wear it every day. the orange is beautiful in person. great fall color. perfect amount of swing.
other I feel both confident and comfortable in this dress. it runs true to size, though maybe just a little bit large. i enjoyed wearing it from the get-go!
other I'm upset. i ordered the grey sweatshirt and while the description says the sweatshirt has a zipper, the picture of the grey does not have a zipper. i prefer no zipper, so when it arrived in the mail with a zipper, i was disappointed. it's going back. why have a model where an item that you're not offering???
3 I liked this dress so much in the store - but didn't have it in my size - so had it shipped (and yes, paid shipping costs...) but it just didn't work on my body. the top is sort of poofy for lack of a better word - it made me look kind of poofy all over and really - i am not poofy! it's a lovely color - and might look terrific on a tall woman - but at 5'3" - not so good - had to return, sadly.
other I ordered this top in white and i was really excited for it to come in! once it once delivered and i tried it on it took me a second to decide if i liked it or not. i think i ordered it a size too big (i ordered a large, i'm usually a medium). it was somewhat boxy, but i think paired with the right pants and shoes it would be just what i wanted!
other I'm 5'10" and felt that it was just too short. otherwise - love it!
other I first saw this sweater coat in the retailer catalog that i got in the mail. i thought it was beautiful. so ethereal! i never thought that i would own it, though because of the initial price. i never thought it would make it to clearance. to my surprise, it did, and then went the extra 30% off! i took the plunge. i followed the advice of the other reviewers, and ordered a size down, a small. i am glad that i did. i still feel like i get the oversized, wrapped in warmth feel. it is not a figure fl
other This dress is very cute and well made. unfortunately it was too short waisted for me and runs small in the bust. the arm holes were too big yet the bust small, very weird fit on me. i am six feet tall with 38c bust, maybe if you are shorter with smaller chest this dress will work for you. it has a thin lining and is not see through even though it is white fabric. i love the dress it just wasn't made for my tall figure.
other Great skirt, easy to wear. perfect weight for spring/fall. very comfortable while still looking stylish. the xs fit well.
other Just purchased this coral coat today. the color is beautiful. the quality is excellent and the coat itself is lightweight,great for travel. great purchase and would recommend buying. going to new york and can't wait to wear it . love, love this coat
other If you're expecting a sweatshirt when you order this, you might be disappointed. it's actually more like a banded t-shirt, which i don't mind. i'm 5'2" and the length comes just below the button on my jeans. perfect length for us shorter gals. sleeves are quite long on me, but i like to wear them pushed up anyways (and they actually stay up). i wouldn't pay full price for this, but it's a nice top at the sale price. cute with destroyed jeans or black leggings.
other Fits true to size. good quality, style and length.
3 Wow. this didn't work for me. loved the red color and drape and subtle shine of the fabric. but it fit like a sack. and you could see deeply into the armpits from the side revealing my bra and more. way too long. i looked silly. maybe it was the size. i'm 5'3" and ordered the large. this was my first retailer dress order but i'm not giving up. maybe the petite would have been a better fit. don't think i'll try again with this one, however.
3 I had a feeling this might not work for me, so i decided to try it on in the store just to verify. i was quite right. i'm a tall gal with a size 36c, and it just billowed out and made me look wider. i normally wear a size m in tops and even this was a tad loose.if you're petite/smaller framed, this will probably work for you. if you're tall and busty, this doesn't do us gals any favors, in my opinion.it is a lovely top, and i loved the velvet trim at the bottom, the inner lining was decent,
other Very feminine and romantic blouse, i love it. it runs small as other reviewer said. i had to go 3 size up, as i want to wear a cami under it. the fabric is soft and sheer. the design emphasizes the nature curve of a woman's body, in a good way. back is longer than the front part. if you like romantic, floral prints and soft fabric, this one is a winner,
other This dress is beautiful and extremely well made. there is s little more weight to the fabric than i had assumed but it's nice for fall/transition/cooler temps. i'm so sad that i will most likely return this dress because it's just not working on my postpartum body but there is a part of me that wants to keep it because of how stunning it is.
other Gorgeous dress, colors as appear in picture, thick material- quality is good. sizing- im usually a size other or small, got a small, and it is big in the chest/ length is below the knee. would recommend a size smaller than normal. not a huge deal- small alteration job.
3 So i haven't actually tried this and i'm sorry for the misleading star rating. i just wanted to get someone's attention on the length. the photos show the dress draping with almost a train even with the model in platform heels but in the video, the dress is about other inches off the floor. is it the model in the video that is extra tall? someone help me out. this looks gorgeous but since it's an online exclusive, i won't be able to try it on at the store.
other Awesome pants. they look a lot better in person than in these pictures. i got it in dark blue. they are very comfortable, and can be used day to night. if you like cropped pants and wide legs this one is a good option. it's a bit more dressy than other models, still look casual and fun. i may end up getting a couple more for myself...
other I love this sweater, especially the sleeves. i'm 5'other and athletic so i don't' feel that it is the most flattering for my figure but i love it so much that i kept it!
other I purchased this tee in the blue and it is so very cute. its such a soft thin tee and a delight to wear on these hot summer days. i went with xs on this one and i still have plenty of room.. i have paired it with jean shorts, capris and it goes really well with the pilcro hypen chino shorts.
other This is my first ever jumpsuit purchase, and i love it! the retailer by me luckily had an xs in stock for me to try, and it fit perfectly (i'm 5'7", 120lbs, slim). looking at the pictures i was a little concerned the jumpsuit would be short, but the length actually hits me closer to my ankles (still a couple inches above). the jumpsuit feels nice and light and comfortable and not difficult to get in and out of. the embroidery detail on the shoulders is a nice touch and the print is fun. would defi
3 I stumbled upon this item at my local retailer, and immediately had to true it on. the colors are so lovely in person. after trying it on, i was disappointed :( the material has a foamy/air feel to it, and the skirt seems to run small. needless to say, i didn't purchase this item.
3 I'm 5'9" and 155lb. i have been wearing small a but this was realllllly small especially at my arms. it made me look like i was taking off... much more beautiful on the model. a medium would e been too big on my torso. the color is amazing! made my blonde hair really pop. i don't love green but this was so different.  would love to find something else in this color that suits me! you need to be a super skinny waif to look good in this!
other This poncho is so cute i love the plaid check design, the colors look like sorbet & cream and it will pair well with a turtleneck and jeans or pencil skirt and heels. i love this look for fall and it can roll right into spring. great buy!!
other Wore with leggings & ballet flats ??compliments!
3 I really like the pilcro serif style but the stet style does not work for my body. will have to return.
other The turqoise color is pretty, however, it did smell bad out of the package. i wore it once and it transferred the dye to my skin and white pants, bra and cami! hope it all comes out in the wash. i tried to hand wash the shirt and now have blue hands and a blue tub.
other These jeans are worth every penny! they fit me perfectly as soon as i put them on, and i wore them the rest of the day! they are true to size with very generous stretch...if anything, i would size down. they feel durable, but not like typical denim. very soft. i am 5'3" and about 117 or so, and my normal 2other fit like a dream. i did end up exchanging these because there was a small nick on the inside of the left thigh, and i was afraid they might tear right open. if the new pair comes without defe
other I love pajama pants by this company. i have a couple now and they are all so soft and lightweight.
other I had been eyeing this top online, decided to hit my local retailer to try it on! it is an adorable spring tunic!i think it runs a size larger then your usual size. for reference, i am 5'7" and 139 pds, small busted, and i bought a size 6, fits perfect. i will machine wash and hang to dry. happy with my purchase!
other Unbelievably soft fabric that doesn't feel like it will pill. i ordered dark grey. i'm 5'3" 130 (just after baby) and size m fits well, super-flattering. doesn't smash my buns. the seams are in all the right places to flatter. styling is between ballerina and badass, as i think the ankle wraps look a little tough. i highly recommend.
3 This dress runs a bit small. the large arm holes were unflattering to my small chest. also, this dress seemed to make my belly protrude. it kind of made me look pregnant in a way that no other dress has! i could see this dress being flattering on someone with a very flat stomach or a large chest. not me!!
other I love this shirt for its subdued colors and casual style. it is lighter in weight than a flannel shirt but retains a feeling of softness. it is from cloth and stone, a brand i like. usually i buy that brand in a small because their shirts run large for me. i liked this shirt so much i ordered it twice and waited for a backorder. i sent the small size back and was lucky enough to get a medium before the next out of stock situation.
other I had bought the pull over in the same fabric and now this zipper jacket style. so fun and love the texture. i waited for markdown plus promo and it was worth waiting.
other The color of the sweater is beautiful, but the fit was awful. it was too "swingy" and made me look like i gained 10lbs instantly, (i'm 5'1", 108lbs). i will be unfortunately returning this item.
3 This dress is really beautiful. very well made and high quality fabrics. unfortunately, it is cut very narrow. i am between sizes, ordered up and still felt like it was at least a size too small. i think if you have any curves in your midsection that this dress is going to be a challenge. if you are lean and straight then this will look great on you.
other I saw the photo of the young woman wearing this dress in the reviews and she looked beautiful, i on the other hand looked awful. the fabric of the entire dress is quite stiff, so the dress didn't move with me; it sort of felt as if i was wearing a paper cut out. then to contribute to the volume, the sleeve is not set in, it is a raglan style, that on me looked more like a bat suit, than what i was hoping for, a beautiful distinctive dress for an important affair. also the belt didn't enhance the
other This top is very versatile. i wore it out to dinner with skinny jeans on a friday night, but it can easily transition to a saturday afternoon stroll around town top.
other This coat looks great, but the fabric is thin--only partly wool. the snaps also don&amp;amp;#39;t stay shut very well; i&amp;amp;#39;ll probably add a hook-and-eye closure for security. despite its flaws, it looks good enough that it&amp;amp;#39;s a keeper (when purchased on-sale).
3 This skirt ran short, small, and boxy. if you can get the right fit, the skirt is great quality and super cute, but i recommend trying on in store for sizing.
other Love this top. comfy, soft, and a great length. slightly longer in the back, and works great with leggings or jeans. i love that is has long sleeves. i wish it came in more colors.
other Okay, these are seriously the cutest black jeans i've ever put on my body. i can't say enough positive things about them. sure, the color bleeds a little (like the previous review stated), but they're black jeans. i haven't encountered a single pair of designer black jeans that don't have some color transfer. also, these jeans are really stretchy which makes them a dream to wear. here is my one complaint -- i am normally a size 29-30 depending upon brand, cut etc. i had to size down to a
other Love the colors! love the stripes! great shape! great style! but...i am normally a 1other on top...and this pulled across my back...so i have it in for an exchange for a 14. sometimes i have to do that...i have a broad back. we will see how it fits! but what an adorable shirt!
other Looked really cute on the hanger, so i took it with me into the dressing room. the fabric is super soft, and the top is very flattering however the bottom is way too short! you can't tell from the picture but the sides are rounded and go up higher on your leg. the model has the waist band pulled lower than i think you'd most likely be wearing it making the outfit appear longer. i wish i could pull this off...maybe i'm just too old for it.
3 The fabric of this skirt is absolutely beautiful. however the fit, albeit unique, is not extremely flattering in my opinion. it may be because i am somewhat of a pear/hourglass shape rather than a more straight shape, but the fit is a little off imo. i am 5'8" and 135# and ordered both the 6 & 8 and felt the 8 fit a little better.
other It's hard to tell how jeans will fit when shopping online. i was very pleasantly surprised. they are super soft, very high quality and look even better in person. i'm 5'3 118 lbs and i ordered the 27p and may have to get them taken up an inch, but they fit perfectly through the hips and come in at the knee. i'm big in the hips and small in the waist and they fit perfectly. highly recommend for petites out there!
other I see other reviewers are like me. we are wondering why antho has so many waistless, big, flowy tops! please! more tops with a defined waist! please!i love this top. it's a gorgeous color and a lot of work to it, very retro antho, not just a t-shirt like so many are these days. to my delight, it runs large. i usually wear a 1other or 16, but the store had a 1other in the sale room, and not only did it fit, but i plan to have my seamstress taper the waistline and cut off the "wings" that flare off on t
other Nicely designed romper with an wide elastic waist band that can be worn on the hips or around the waist. not too short for this 60+ body and very comfy. i wear either a med. or large and went with large for this. a good buy.
other Size 2p is perfect for me (32a, 25" waist, and 32" hip) with a lot of room left for a big dinner. the design is exceptionally creative and attractive, and the fabric is of very high quality.
other The material was thin, showed every lump you'd rather hide and clung to the body. even the sleeves were tight. looked inexpensive.
other Great jeans. especially since i'm getting tired of my skinny jeans. length is great for someone tall like me (5'10") unless you wear heels with them but these are more sneaker/sandal jeans.
other I love the sweater online and even more in person! i paired it with a long sleeve top with a bell sleeve and it looked great!! very bohemian look!
other Really cute top, comfy, with just enough flare that it can be dressed up a bit, or worn just casual. not clingy at all...in fact, maybe just a tad too flowy around the middle, but not so much that it kept me from going back to buy it immediately in a second color! i typically wear a large, but suspect the arms on the medium might be a tad small if i sized down.
other Ladies this top shrinks!!! i am very disappointed, i was in love with this top and the first time i washed it it shrunk a significant amount. i did not use a dryer, i laid this piece out to dry as i do with the majority of my knit tops and it shrunk. it is a lot shorter and much tighter, especially in my arms. if you love this top i might suggest buying a size up and washing it to fit.
other When i saw this sweater, it made me think of the 70's chic trend thats very now but due to the colors (my favorite tones) it would be something i would be reaching for for years to come. i love it combined with jeans but i also worse it over a dress (see photo) - i am wearing it over corey lynn calter floral dress "paeonia dress", and i paired it with the "rosebud layered necklace". i got two of this sweater as i want to have one for when i wear the first one out :) i am 5'6", 127 and even thoug
3 I am typically a small at retailer, but always order a small and medium to try since i'm tall. the color of the green is really pretty, and i can see wearing it on the weekend with casual sandals, and dressing it up with a cropped jacket for work. the sizing is way off on this dress, though. the small is too short for me (personally). i'm 5'8" and the waist doesn't sit low enough for a drop-waisted style. so i tried a medium. the medium is not sized correctly at all. i tried it on and it fits 3 si
other Review title says almost all. add to that that it is age appropriate, unlike other kedia dresses, for the very young. just too cute for words. i have all of the other tk peasant dresses and although youthful they are appropriate for anyone young of heart. this however, on an older woman, looks ridiculous. i would have liked it for those 9 months but even then it would cover quadruplets!
3 I purchased the sand color (beige/) one size up from my usual xs to allow for extra room around the hips. the dress fit a little large so the extra room wasn't necessary. the fabric was much thinner than i expected for the price point. the dress was sheer and on my lighter skin tone looked more like a lab coat than a dress. this may be stunning on someone a bit taller. at 5'other it just hung on my frame and didn't do much for me. the pockets are a nice touch but overall the cut was unflattering and
other This looks awesome with leggings / jeggings and booties or slip ons. great buy. its a wee big, but there are slits up the sides pretty high.
other I'm 5'other and 110 pounds and i ordered the 26 petite. the jeans are fabulous...flattering....comfortable...i could go on and on. the fabric is super soft and the fit hugs in all the right places. it is a nice flare bottom. i will have to wear these with heels or wedges, they are too long for flats.
other Very cute and true to size if not just a little large up top.
other I ordered a small, which is my usual retailer size, but this was like a tent on me. it's fine if you like things super super blousey but that wasn't what i was looking for. also it is very long, a very weird amount of long. also there is only eyelet on the front. the whole back of the shirt is just plain fabric. i like the idea of this shirt but all in all it was very disappointing.
other I love this blouse. the color is so pretty! i might even wear this to a holiday party. the tie looks great so many ways--love the versatility. i think i will get a lot of wear out of this blouse--with a pencil skirt, jeans or under a blazer.
3 The pattern and fabric on this dress are very nice. there is just too much fabric. it's much too baggy but could make a nice maternity dress. i'll be returning it.
other Just got both today, skirt and top, and i love how soft the material is. and btw, i learned a valuable lesson from past moth sweater purchases, dry clean; even though the "how to care for" tag states hand-washing, d.r.y. clean. the last moth sweater i washed was not in the same shape it was when i first purchased, but i never made that mistake again ;) and it was one of my faves!i bought this particular top in the large as i wanted the "boyfriend" oversized look, and i love the way it drapes o
3 The idea of this dress is lovely. the fabric is pleasing to the touch. the print manages to be eye catching but understated. i don't know my exact measurements but i typically wear an extra small and i rarely have fit issues with off the rack clothing. i read the other reviews about the odd fit but decided to take a chance. i ordered an extra small in this dress and the bottom half fits perfectly. the top fits poorly. i have a fairly athletic build but it is a bit too large for my shoulders. how
3 I purchased the 0p online and it was so incredibly short on me it wouldn't even serve as a tunic!! it was also so tight in the bust area that i could not pull it down because there is absolutely no give in the material. the berry color was not as bright as it had appeared online but in fact was a very muddled color that seemed to make the material look even more cheap. i would need to size up considerably to have good fit without give in the bust and arms and judging by the structure of the dres
other Love the blue color, different than many blue tops i own. i thought it was going to be a thicker knit and perhaps more stiff, but it is soft and a lighter knit and it makes the shape once on much more flattering.
other This top is really cute and i think will be a great transition piece. i'm glad i tried it on in the store as it runs very small. i typically wear a 00 or 0 and bought this in a 2. they didn't have it in stock,so i ordered it and hope it fits.
other Perfect for dressing up or dressing down with a pair of jeans. this pullover can be worn during all four seasons of michigans weather, which is a bonus for me. it can also be paired with heels, booties or flats making it extremely versatile.
other This blouse is a disappointment . fabric is cheap looking and the cut is very off. just odd. sleeves awkward . the back of the white shirt on the on-line model is not the same as the white shirt i received. mine was plain in the back like the blue shirt on line even though my shirt was white. no ruffle. returned.
other It is a little boxy, but it?s not unflattering in my opinion. the sweatshirt material is soft, the ruffles keep their shape and position, and aren?t too overwhelming on my small frame. i like the small slits on the sides, they allow the sweater to drape nicely. it also hit at a flattering spot, a little below the hip. 5?1??, 100 lbs, and got the xxs petite. this fit true to size for me.
other I love these shorts. they're really comfortable and versatile. i got them on sale, and for the price they were a steal! the material is nice, and you can dress them up or down.
other I love this vest. get compliments every time i wear it. it's stretchy too :). unfortunately i got ranch dressing on it and spot treated it with shout and now the spot is gone but the color faded there. so little tip don't spill on it lol. my fault though so still other stars!
other A culotte and basketball short hybrid. these culottes are heaven....very comfortable. the are great on windy summer days or walking around the city (between the buildings are like wind tunnels). the waist does run alittle large...i have a 29-30in waist and the medium petite fit my lower waist, but is large on my natural waist...a small petite would be better, so size down one size on the waist. plus the waist band is stretchy, so there is a lot of forgiveness in sizing down. plus the petite's le
other This dress is a lot of fun and would be great for a party or a wedding but unfortunately it didn't fit me right. i ordered a small since i usually wear a size other but the waist was just a little bit loose while the dress was too tight across the bust. this caused the dress to pull up in the front and make it look too high in the waist. i guess i'm just too busty for this dress. too bad because i really wanted it to work. it is a lovely dress.
other I liked these as soon as i saw them. the are very comfortable and the fit is great. well constructed and the material is soft but thicker.. easily worn into the cooler days. i am so happy i made this purchase!
other I am in love with this suit. i got the white floral. it's beautiful and classy. it feels like great quality too! i am going to get the black color too when it's back in stock. i am 5'9 and about 140lbs (3other dd) and i'm wearing a medium. i got both the small and medium and decided to keep the medium. it does have more fabric with the medium but the bigger size covers my chest and bigger bottom.
other I saw this top online and read the reviews that it was running small. i am normally an xxs in most retailer clothing. i am 5'6 110 for reference. found it in the store and took both the xs and small in to try on. the reviewers were right! i tried the xs on first and it was quite snug and short. the small fit perfectly. it was a bit longer too. great style and soft fabric. once you size up, you'll love it...
other I mentioned the sizing is true to size but it should be important to note that they will loosen throughout the day, so when i order another color i will size down one size. the color is as pictured too. these are great for casual and business casual wear. so comfortable and perfect and flattering for my shape, athletic with muscular thighs.can't wait to order another pair.
other I love the style of this dress and the color is beautiful and very much like the photo. like previous reviewers mentioned, the top is a little loose in comparison to the bottom. i originally bought a size other but then exchanged it for a 2. i tend to be between those sizes. the other fits great on bottom but the straps are a bit loose. it might be better for bigger busted ladies!
other I wanted to love this skirt and i agree with the other reviewers. the color of the skirt is beautiful. i've never seen anything quite like it at retailer! the quality is superb and the material is fairly substantial given the brocade design. however, the skirt made my hips look a lot bigger than they are because the shape of the skirt is more of a tulip-design. i purchased an 0 petite (because my normal size 00 petite was sold out) and while the waist part fit the hip part was disproportionately l
other The overall color of this dress is more buttery white and the pale golden embroidery almost blends in.therefore i think the dress benefits from being styled . i tried bold colored scarves with fringes and big statement jewelry. this dress is more casual with its fringes , the jeans like material ( although softer than cotton) as well as the loose pullover style. it is easy to dress down with a blue jean jacket, casual sandals or even sneakers. i have a 38 c chest and the l fits almost too loos
other This jumpsuit runs large so i sized down perfectly one full size down. i have a size b chest and was very comfortable with no bra, as the built in cups gave me the perfect coverage. it looked like a dress standing, but had such a flattering and fun shape when you move. everyone loved it!
other I bought this blouse in a size other (my normal size) to pair with winter white slacks and gun metal pumps. it was a hit. i felt beautiful and professional. and received many compliments at work as well as at an after work gathering the quality is surprisingly sturdy given the lace work. the collar and cuffs really set the design off. this top is much more impressive in person.
other I was excited to try this dress on in person and so glad i did. it's actually really cute. the material is soft and super comfortable. the dress hits just above the knee and the tie in the front accentuates your waist. i was pleasantly surprised at how cute it really is. i'm excited to wear this to work! worth the price.
other I find that every year (or two at the most) i have to find a new favorite black dress or two (fading, etc.), and, this is definitely one of those dresses for this year (almost one to buy another, so i have one that looks good in a year or two)! the dress is all around flattering and comfortable... looks wonderful with high heels and flats, looks good at work and while out having fun! probably won't be able to count how many times i wear it this year!
other The material is soft. it looks perfect with ankle jeans or flare jeans.
other This sweater came in just as expected . . . adorable. as others have said, it is soft and comfy. i will wear it everywhere (including work). i love it! :)
other I am 34dd. bought sz med and have plenty of room up top. the black motif is really a dark, purple/blue. slightly sheer. the length on the med is 251/other from bottom of collar (the collar adds other 1/4") the length does not cover my bum like the model , covers 2/3rds, nor does it appear as long in front.
other These pants are so great. i was debating between them and some sateen denim style pants from another store, but these definitely take the cake. the fit is awesome--although i am a 26 in the green and a 27 in the black, so that's kind of weird.
other I'm just ordering my 3rd pair!! i first got the grey,,,just about live in them! super comfy and flattering! then i got the off white and now i ordered the green which i cannot wait to get. great pant!
3 Maybe it's just that it's a bath robe, but i'm not crazy about how this falls. it is very soft, cozy, and cute, though.
other The top looks better on the model than in-person. it fits loose and looks boxy and matronly. i don't like the sleeve length or the top style, it just didn't look flattering or good. i am sending it back. looks very boxy.
other I bought this top last week and absolutely love it! it hides my muffin top and falls in all the right places. it does not cling, but is very flattering for my size 12-1other body.
other I bought the green, and it is a dark teal. the fabric is so soft and it can be dressed up or down. the detail truly sets it apart from your boring tee. great purchase, especially at the sale price.
other This shirt has it all. great staple piece to add to your wardrobe. not only is it classy with a pair of black pants and booties but you can add a little spice to it by dressing it up with some funky earrings. found it to be a bit large in the armpit area so i sized down.
3 I love ponchos and the colors are gorgeous, but the pictures make it look much longer than it is. i would've loved it if i were petite but i personally don't think it's meant for taller people. such a shame.
other I finally broke down and went on a christmas shopping spree at retailer for myself with hubby in tow as they are gifts from him.the skirt is a beautiful dark navy, super soft knit. very long with a texture pattern. i am 5'9" and have put on a few pounds lately but typical wear and 8/10 and bought the large because i didn't want to try it on. it works for me because i don't like skirts to cling to much. even my pencil skirts i like a more loose fit. normally id say a medium would probably f
other They were fine. i had hoped they'd be more like begging a though... more structure. they were very much just leggings and rather unflattering in the crotch area. they felt well made though. might work for someone else. not a bad legging.
other I ordered the ivory of this dress, expecting it to be a nice dress i could wear into my second trimester of pregnancy. instead, i received a dress that looks like a ugly, vintage-gone-wrong curtain of fabric. the 'ivory' is the color of yellowed newspapers. the fabric was cheap and had thread pieces sticking up all over the place. i would've been better off sewing myself a dress out of drapes a la gone with the wind or sound of music. the fit isn't that great, either. big and boxy. it could acco
other I love this cardigan, it is very soft, and unique (i am a sucker for polka dots). i tried on my usual size (xs) and it fit. i wish they did have it in petite, however. added this one to my wish list :-)soft, versatile.
other Very cute and comfortable! can be wear with tights and boots or into spring with flags! very flattering fit for someone with smaller upper body them bottom half!!
other The fabric is quality, nice thicker fabric. the fit was strange, the top part fit great through the arms and shoulders, except my bust makes the front stick out and results in a maternity look. it was also slightly wide, i considered taking it in on the sides. ultimately it wouldn't be worth the money. it would be a great top for someone with a smaller chest.
other I am floored by all of the positive comments about these culottes! i can see that they would work for someone who is rail thin and has no hips... but for those of us with curves (i'm a size 12, hourglass), these are very unflattering. they made me look like i was carrying an extra 20-30 pounds, just around the hips! so bummed because they look so cute on the model.
other Sadly, going back. ordered m, light color option, very difficult to pull over my head, not a good sign. got it on and neckline looked attractive (height w/o being a mock turtle), but whole thing a bit small around middle. could order the l, but i'm not liking the feeling of the fabric, it feels tight with restrictive and nonuniform stretch: 33 cotton/27 poly/27 acrylic and 9other rayon/other spandex "contrast", which must mean the stripes. combine w/fact that the two wide stripes are right at my middle
other I am a collector of clothes and textiles. that is a passion. this blouse meets all the criteria of something treasured from times past. the roses are almost charles rennie macintosh. i am so happy to own this blouse! it fits perfectly and makes me feel beautiful, stylish in my own style.
3 I saw this skirt online and went to the store immediately to try on. i was a bit disappointed. the size is tts but the prints were prettier online. the material is ok. the regular is long so probably won't look good on a shorter personif it is still available when the price comes down, i might buy it.
other I purchased this towards the end of winter because it reminded me of spring time! it is such a lovely soft tee, with a delicate flower design. i wear it with jeans. it always makes me feel happy.
other Medium is equivalent to eu size 40. the pants have the eu tag and i would have ordered differently if i had known this. great quality pant; just order according to your european equivalent.
3 I saw this top on sale and tried it on right away. my normal medium was too big, so i purchased the small in the rose color. wore it with a shimmery kimono and cream colored pilcro boyfriend jeans. wow, what an outfit!!!!then i washed it according to directions, and sadly it shrunk into a crop peplum tank. i was so disappointed. i wished i had read the reviews beforehand.
other Quality jumpsuit but poor design. the green made me look a bit like "gumby the cartoon character"
other I have been searching for months to find a pair of top-quality, slim fit, high-waisted jeans, either straight leg or flare. my search has ended with these flare jeans from paige, thanks to retailer. the fabric is incredibly soft, yet has that little "snap" of stretchiness we have all come to expect in expensive jeans. i also like the dark wash and the fact that there aren't those odd color striations across the hips. i bought size 27, which fits me perfectly. (virtually all my other jeans a
3 The dress is pretty and like retailer it is nice quality, i just didn't keep it because it had no shape on me and even with a belt didn't look right. i would have gone down a size in this dress also.
other This was a miss for me. the armholes are too low, it's lined and heavy. way too long. just didn't wow me. the lace is sturdy and beautiful, though.
other Just tried this dress on in the store and ordered a petite because i'm 5'. if you are even 5'2" or taller i wouldn't recommend a petite fit unless you prefer the tunic length. this dress and material has a flattering drape for those of us with trouble belly regions.
other Love this top, the flutter sleeves are really pretty and give the top a bit more pizzazz than just being a regular tee. it makes it easy to dress up or down. the length is great, not super long but not too short. i ordered a medium and it fits well, not tight and isn't baggy, the material allows it to float away from the body a bit and doesn't feel stretched over my belly :) or anything. nice silky weight.
3 I was so excited to get this dress and could tell right away it was beautiful. the fabric and detail are perfect and seem great for summer. then i tried it on ....to say the bust area is tight and not proportioned correctly would be putting it very nicely. it was a total joke. this dress is for very small chested only.
other This cute dress is swingy and chock full of fun little details.  love the embroidery, colors, crochet lace, tassels, wide sleeves.  don't like that it's all polyester and some embroidery is unraveling so i don't know what to do about that.  size down if your petite or slender.  i'm a med-large (135# 36c 38-27-35) and medium fit great at the bodice/shoulders.  hem hits my knees in regular size.
other Tried it on in store, it's more of a cornflower blue instead of a true navy. if you zoom in you'll also notice there's a pattern to it. i think it gives it a little something extra. i may put gold buttons on it as the plain black buttons are a little boring.  didn't buy it right away and came back with a survey coupon and it was out of stock. had them order and free-ship it to me from the store. fit is nice and relaxed. i like how it goes up in the back so it pairs well with dresses and
other This is a beautiful kimono but just isn't made well. the one i received already had a couple small holes and a pull in the thread that was very noticeable. after reading the additional reviewer who wore it an hour and it was already pilling, it is going back for good. such a shame!
other When i saw this dress the model was standing in an outdoor setting and i fell in love with it but then i noticed the model in an indoors photo the dress looked different. as i studied the difference, it was the way the plaid fell on each dress. the one i liked fell more vertically giving it a slimming effect and the others were horizontal giving it a widening effect so, i went to my local retailer to see. they had the one i liked on a dummy. it is tts and the plaid matched perfectly. the front flo
other Love this top, it looks just as pictured. the lilac color is just as it looks, which i am happy about. sometimes this shade ends up darker than it appears online, but not with this top. it is soft velvet, silky lining and hits right where it does on model. i got a pxs my usual size. i am 5'3. the neck is a bit tight once buttons are buttoned up, but again this is pictured. well made and very pretty. can dress up or down.
other I wanted to love this dress - everything about it was so beautiful - except the fit , the length, the neckline ... i tried on a 4, 6 and petite 4. i'm 5'5" 130 32dd - the top of the dress runs small/tight - so i needed to try it on without a bra.the length on the regular is to the floor/with the petite to my ankles. the print was beautiful and like in the photo, it flowed nicely but there was just too much fabric - maybe it was just the design for me - it did nothing for my figure at all
other These pants are more like 9" not 10". i was very dissappointed. the color is great and so is the fabric.if you look more closely at the model the pants don't fit her either!! they are too small! i haven't decided whether or not to take them back because i am losing weight. i am a 3other so far but these pants are like a 30. i need the color because they go perfectly with a top i bought from retailer
3 This is a very cute dress. it was perfect before i washed it. the problems i had after washing it was the outer cotton layer of the dress shrunk length wise while the inside black lining did not, so the black lining peeks out a good inch or two. and since the dress is shorter i can't really wear it without using biker shorts, especially for the back of the dress since it's shorter there and if i bent over you could see everything. i'm so disappointed in the quality because it is a very cute, ver
other You can?t go wrong with this one. it?s is super flattering. the size medium fit perfectly. for reference, i have a 38in chest (3other ff) and in the medium i was not over exposed, and it can be worn with a racing back bra with it not showing. i wish it came i more colors. please retailer?make this one in more colors.
3 Scratchy, wide cut = not flattering, i tried to make this work because i wanted a different, unique cardigan. but.... the color is not for me either.., it's yellow/ivory. bummer! so cute on the model! the snaps are my very favorite part!
other Love this poncho! it's casual, has a bit of a sexy vibe, comfy. great with leggings, probably boots once it's a little cooler. soft and lacey, lace is sheer so a cami is needed.
other I ordered the black and white, and the pattern is just as pictured (so cute!), but after reading the other reviews, i ordered a size up. and i'm glad i did. the m would have been snug, but the skirt in the l fit me as pictured on the model. i am i b cup, and the top was snug but not unflatteringly so on me. it's still a dress i can wear to work and even wear a tank underneath if i wanted to. overall, i'm incredibly happy with this one; i'm fairly straight, though, so i can see how this might be
3 I loved the lavender color on the cape. it was soft and comfortable. but the design on the front ruined it for me. it took me all of other minute to know it was going back. it looked like florescent bird feathers nothing wrong with that, it just wasn't my style at all. i was a bit disappointed as it would have been perfect for cool ca nights. it looked more subdued in the photo, it's not. i clicked i would recommend to others as it is nicely made and i guess just not my taste as far as the colors an
other Love the lace on the back! it's a sweet take on a typical tee! comfy! a little on the boxier side but a great tee.
other This is going to be perfect for my daughter's graduation. she is in love with it and it looks amazing on her!
other This is a beautiful tunic. the colors are vibrant and the stitching is high quality. please note that the insets on the sides are not actual stitching but a print. it is still very pretty. please size down a size. i am usually a large, wearing a 1other or 1other if something runs tight across the bust, i ordered a large and it is a bit big under the arms but too big through the waist area. i am not small in this area either.i would recommend buying this tunic.
other I am 5'4, 34c, with a pear shape. this dress fit me perfectly in a medium (30 inch natural waist). i had to use a safety pin to keep the bosom from gaping too much, so a smaller chested person would likely not have any issues. however, the material and design were perfectly pinup and work appropriate, so i was willing to make adjustments for it.
other I thought this dress would be a cute beach cover up so i was excited to order it but i was very disappointed. i am 5'7 and i usually wear a size small top and other dress so i ordered a small in this dress but it was huge!! i understand that it is not meant to be form fitting and i wasn't expecting it to be but when i tried this on i felt like i was wearing a potato sack. i feel like an extra small would have been just as bad. i was so upset. it also has thin silver lines through it which, for me, m
other I love these pjs! the sale price finally made the set affordable and i could not be happier! so soft and comfy!
other Love this dress. purchased in white. runs true to size. made well.
other So i tried on the regular size in the store, and love the top, but looked too big on me.color is gorgeous and rich, the sheer adds a little whimsical to it, and i love the tie-neck trend of lately. would go nicely with jeans (skinny or flare) or trousers, not sure about a skirt though,.
other These cords are great, the fit, the style, everything! my new favorite fall pants!
3 I really wanted to love it but it was way too maternity on me. i love flowy but the flow on this dress hit me in all the wrong places. but i must say i have a 34ddd bust and wear a medium regularly. well i sized down and ordered a small and it just didn't work. it just flowed right off my chest to what looked like a dress concealing a baby bump. overall its cute just not for me.
other Such a pretty little sweater, gorgeous detail. i wish it were a bit longer, it was too boxy for my large chest. otherwise it fits tts. i wanted to lie inside of it and take a nap. so comfortable. please make more sweaters in this knit!
other I ordered the red motif online in my current size 10. the fabric is so beautiful, even prettier than the online photo. the fit is not great on me. it made me look wider at my chest area and almost catches at my hips (i'm sure shapewear would take care of this). the dress looks really good with a jacket or vest but just weird by itself. i agree with the other reviewer who said it was a little short - i'm 5'9". it looks good standing up but is very short when i sit. there's no real stretch to the
other I'm very disappointed in the quality. it seems more like a pajama than a tunic. definitely not worth 100.00 dollars. i plan to return it.
3 I love the style of this top. hand washed before wearing and it looks like a rag before i even got to wear it. very disappointed since i thought it would be a very practical tank.
3 When you buy a dress full price and it goes on sale before you can even wear it ($168 down to $49) uuuuggghhh... i like the dress fine enough, but it has a weird under wire, it makes my chest look strange, like i don't fill it in. i usually don't have that problem as a c cup. more orange/red then yellow as well. wouldn't recommend.
other Out of stock so quickly in my size. please restock!
other I bought this in purple and then just now in navy.i love the sleeve length and neckline. this shirt is made of a very soft knit material a so its very comfy and flattering. goes well with jeans, shirts and shorts. i definitely recommend purchasing this shirt.
other Love love love this skirt. i walked into retailer in august not looking to buy this skirt even though i saw it in the catalog and thought it was cute. once i tried it on i fell in love. i purchased both black and blue. super flattering and true to size. its a must have for sure.
other On me, thsi was ginormous, looked like a mu mu. it is pretty, but there was just too much fabric, even in the smallest size. the quality seems nice, and it looks pretty, but overwhelming. i will say, i think it would work on tail lean people, i have pretty muscular shoulders, so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look 30 pounds heavier, no joke. fabric is soft though. give it a try, just not for me...ref: 11other lbs, 30dd, 26.other in waist.
other At the altar of bailey 44!  all hail the 'gathered stripes dress' because it can do nothing wrong, especially to my body.  i got the mp and this piece totally enhances what little i've got.  so happy!
other This is such a beautiful dress.  but have to return for the reasons others have noted.  the chest does not fit well.
other I love this top.  the fit is great for me. i ordered a small. the color is a bit more peach than the pink in the picture,  but still very cute.
other Fits true to size. i am a size other and it fit perfectly. nice quality. fits like a glove.
other It is the cutest detailed little white top. i recommend this because you can wear it anywhere and dress it up with a scarf.
other I found this in the returned section of the store in a large. i am normally a m but the fit would have been too small in the shoulders. it is very light weight and the color is much lighter in person which means it will go right into spring!
other This dress really was huge, and not at all flattering. i don't know how they got it to look good on the model in the picture. material was nice and soft, but i really don't see how anyone could look good in this, no matter what your body shape is.
other This dress caught my eye because of the beautiful fabric, but i read the reviews online so i didn't buy it. i just went to a store and couldn't help but try on the size small. i usually range from an xs to a s, and i would say that the size s fits great around my shoulders. it is true what the other shoppers say about this dress being like a tent. it is and i won't lie about that. when i tried it on, i asked a sales person to bring me some belts to try on to create a waistline. once i put on a b
other I bought these in the navy stripe and they're soft and comfortable. i'm between a small and a medium and the medium works here -- i could not have worn a small in these. the narrow stripes make the pants flattering and the drape is lovely. i wish they had pockets but i guess i can't have everything!
other I love this skirt for so many reasons! one, it isn't a circle skirt, per se, which is good. i am hip heavy and don't need extra volume at my hips. so while it's called a circle skirt, the description states that it's a-line. based on that, i was willing to risk it. also, i am 5other and tend to stay away from above the knee dress and skirt lengths (just my personal preference). although i am only 5'2" i ordered the regular size 10 for the extra length and it's exactly at my knee; perfect for me.
other I saw this in the store, not on sale and loved it. was so happy when it went on sale! it is beautifully made and is soft and cozy.
3 I really loved the look of this dress online and couldn't wait to try it on. based on my measurements i ordered a petite medium, following the petite size chart. the dress was the perfect length for my 5'other frame, but it was just way too loose and not flattering on my figure. i'm 36c-32-37 and i looked like a sack of potatoes in the dress. the fabric and lining feel great though. i just wasn't the right fit for me.
other This top is spectacular. intense and color soaked. i got bleu. super stretchy and comfy. the twisty part hugs and emphasizes your curves...even size 34a like me. the v neck is not too wide and low cut. it is narrower, close fitting and attractive. the seam in the middle thorax is a tad strange but it needs to exist due to the twist design. overall this top is cute, long and let's say men and women of all ages will enjoy it. it will make you beautiful on the outside and inside. it is not my usual
other I love this item! . they hang & flow beautifully like the weightlessness of a silk skirt.the front peek-a-boo cut outs really make them a delight to wear & show off some skin!somewhat transparent,i topped it off with a lightweight tunic length for modesty... but the placement of the painterly design really works in my favor so i could wear them with something shorter if i choose to. (like the model)heads turned as i walked by!
other This is much prettier online than on me. too much dress, even though i sized down.
other Loved loved loved the shirt but...the material was so thin
other A very pretty pair of over-the-knee socks. i purchased the dark grey color, which has a metallic silver thread running through it. a nice subtle but glitzy touch. the knitted pattern is intricate and nicely done. i'm 5' 4" and they do come up well above the knee. if you are walking quite a bit, they don't stay above the knee, but they do seem to stay just below the knee. because the yarn is fairly thin they don't look bunchy even if they come down a bit. i have very sensitive skin, and metallics
3 I wear a typical 2other in coh jeans and i ordered these in a 25. they fit but they feel more like jeggings than skinny jeans. the wash isn't as faded out as in the picture. and at 5'2" the rip is right at my kneecap. i bought these for the distressed wash, and will probably return this pair as it looks darker and less faded in person. i look nothing like the model does in this pair of jeans.
other Love, love, love this silk dress. i feel classic retailer is back! perfect for hot and steamy summer days..just a few photos of the back, which has the belt band sewn in kind of high so that it can be wrapped through the side loops, grecian style. for some reason, in the online back photo, the model is wearing the dress backwards. .i'm 5'2", currently 33-25-37 or 38 hips, narrow shoulders and torso, bra size 28dd/30d/32c. i tried on the size other regular which is the only one i found in the s
other I was pleasantly surprised how this dress fit me. very comfortable and flattering on me. love the look. need to watch not to wear anything scratchy as it may pull the fabric
other I'm an xl in retailer tops, and purchased this in the size xl. it fits very nicely; not tight. i usually have problems with peplum blouses hitting me oddly since i have a short waist, but this fit beautifully. i like the feel of the high quality fabric. the color green works so well with my red hair. i highly recommend this blouse.
other Very cute!! true to size
other I wanted to love this sweater but the fit is just awkward. it is very short and box and ends up being very short in the back. i am going to return this item.
other I am 5'other and a curvy girl and find this dress to be super flattering in fit and length. i got a size 1other which is my typical size. the slip is a little tight in the bust area for me so i find it easier to put on first and then the dress over which is possible because it snaps in and out at the shoulders. it arrived super wrinkled but i found tossing it in the dryer for a few min helped - is it dry clean which is slightly high maintenance but so cute it's worth it. great dress for transitioning in
other Great sweater coat! i bought the camel color and it looks so good over all black. it runs large. i usually buy a medium in sweaters but his one i bought the small. it is very unique and a cool take on a peacoat.
3 There comes a point where i have to draw the line with things i purchase... i ordered this as i didn't have a black skirt, but thought ti wasn't special enough, don't get me wrong, it fits nicely, and is comfortable, but i was wowed. 0p or xs p fir perfectly, 26.other in waist and 11other lbs. if you want ta nice casual skirt, the sale price is a good fir for the skirt, just wasn't enough for me :-)
other I received this blouse for christmas and it is just gorgeous! it fit true to size, and goes with my whole romantic, feminine style that i have without being overly girly. not too sheer, so no need for a tank underneath, and being that it is neutral, it will go with just about everything i own! love it!
other This dress rules.  so comfy, and versatile.  flattering cut.  great with flats, wedges, booties, boots with tights.  easily my new fav.  runs large.  i am usually a 6/8 and the other was perfect after i steamed it.  no button gap either, i am a 34c.
other As soon as i saw this piece online i knew i had to have it. like other reviewers the black flower part on the shoulders can be itchy underneath. it does run large but that's my style. i love pairing pieces like this with skinny jeans or leggings and booties. can be dressed up or down. highly recommend :)
other I love this - great coverage, goes with everything, flattering pockets, soft and soothing taupey gray palette - a+. retailer does it again.
other I have been looking for a cuddly yet nice looking sweater like this one for a long time. i love anther as they always deliver what i am looking for.
other Gorgeous color, flowy fabric, unique design - this top is a winner. i don't even mind that i'll have to wear a strapless bra with it! a little bit on the larger size, but not too big in my opinion.
other Runs a bit small, but this top is super soft like all the cloth and stone tops. great for all seasons!!
other This fits a little short on me and i'll have to wear a shirt underneath even with a high waist pant. i still adore it! get it for the price!
other This sweater is absolutely gorgeous! the green is a lovely, rich shade and the material is wonderfully soft. i love the slightly slouchy fit, but it's far from looking shapeless. i bought my usual size small (5'8", 140, straight athletic build, size 4/6) and i love it casually paired with boyfriend jeans and ankle boots or a little elevated with a skinny and heels.i'm so happy to have tracked it down in our local store, i'd buy them all if there was more in stock!
other Had a feeling when i saw this that it would be a great top. love the way the elasticized neck hugs tightly and has two little back buttons. the beading is elegant and subtle. the body flows nicely, not overly billowy. definitely true to size. interesting ocher color; a yellowy-green. this is one to own.
other Material is nice, great for a party or date night. fits true to size, (l for me, i'm a 12). would recommend. the bell sleeve is right on trend and very tasteful.
other Not much to say. fits tts. a beautiful top. colors are striking!!
other Fully lined until just above the knee, silk exterior, rayon lining. can dress it up or down. very lightweight and cool-feeling. this is a beautiful dress. i'm 5'9 and it fit great-- shorter people might need to alter it. i tried it on in the store and felt like a princess, but am hoping it goes on sale.
3 Pretty tee, but not worth the price.  lace is beautiful, but fit is blah.
3 I am a pretty consistent size other or 26. ordered these in my usual 26 and, yikes, right out of the package knew they''d be way to small. they have a lot of stretch in them so i was able to get them buttoned but they were wayyyy too small and looked awful. i returned them for a 27 which i am still waiting for. i'll update this review when they arrive. other than the size issue, they were just as pictured/expected.
3 I found the fit of this dress to be true to size with a flattering bust and waistline; however, the fabric feels cheap and doesn't drape as nicely as i'd hope for the price. this would be a lovely dress in a better quality fabric. for sizing reference, i'm 5'5'', 12other lbs, 30dd, and took my usual size xs - though i'm busty for my size, the top provides nice coverage.
other I'm a 5'7"and curvy, these pants fit well and are so comfortable. i think everyone should own at least one pair!
other It is a little roomy so if you're between sizes go with the smaller. i think it's flattering even if you have a larger chest. love the details and the fabric is a good weight and quality!
other I love tracy reese dresses, but this one is not for the very petite. i am just under other feet tall and usually wear a 0p in this brand. this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress. the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame. not a stranger to alterations, shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment. i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me. i returned this dress.
other I love the design on this top. it's a little thin, but it's held up great with a few washes.
other Love, love, love! wish i had gotten this in every color. the absolute most perfect tank with just the right amount of flow. i am 5'3 with 34d chest and the medium is great.
other This shirt is extremely soft and fits well. great length and perfect casual shirt for fall.
other I love the way this coat looks in the website. it turned out to be a little different than i thought it would be. can't decide if i will keep it.the sleeves are bracelet length, i have long arms so slightly awkward for me. i ordered the small even though i wear a medium in everything else (5'8", 13other #). so glad i did because it is biggish on me.it is unlined but made of a lovely, soft wool. the edges are all finished with a bias edging which is unique and well done. it is boxy, very.lovely wo
other The dress i received is adorable, however, the color is much more subdued than shown in the catalog.
3 While this top is pretty, it's very unflattering. it just looks so boxy on me that it makes me look heavier. too bad, because i really wanted to like it.
3 I have been looking for a basic ivory sweater. i waited for this one to go on sale. the style is cute but the sweater itself is very stiff and heavy. unfortunately i decided to return it.
other I so wanted to love this suit. it was gorgeous - the color, the quality, the style, but i am returning and can not recommend it. the sides need to be connected just a little bit higher and i think it would work, but there is no way you could move around in this without things popping out in front. i mean it would be gorgeous to just lay there in the sun, but i didn't feel like i could even walk safely, and i am not well-endowed. very bummed but it's going back.
other These are horrible pants!!! they run small in the thigh and butt like other cartonnier crops. look great at first....after a few hours of wear the stretch out everywhere!!! absolutely terrible! i have several pairs of cartonnier crops that are my "go to" pants, but these are not worth even the sale price! i'd give them no stars if i could!! this fabric is very different from my other printed pairs. if u must try them, size down and suffer through the first few "tight" hours! trust me...they will
other Love this jacket!!! it is soooo soft and goes with everything. you will want to wear it every day. loved it so much i bought my mother one, too.
other I have alst year's version,a dn they are essentially the smae, minus some leather parts removed... this jacket is great, the back si a little shorter, so it goes so well with peplum tops an ddresses with higher waists (without looking bigger from the back when the hem is longer and hits where the skirt aprts bulge out). i love hte darker color, i wish it came is super dark rinse...i usually buy petites, but i never tired on the eptite in this jacket... i am holding myself back to order this on
other This is a great top. it does run a bit large but it's intended to be flowing. i got so many compliments the first time i wore the top and its actually quite flattering! great purchase, especially on sale!
other I'm 5'8" small 11other pounds. ordered the xs. this dress is gorgeous! my husband loved it! i tried several sticky bras... nothing worked. i'm 32dd i gave up. if your ok with no support, you'll love this dress. sexy back, perfect length, so light!
other Loved this so much i bought it in black and in grey. it fits perfectly and it lays awesomely!! i ended up buying the black in medium and the grey in large for a bit of a different look for each. i usually wear a medium or large so i'd say it fits super true to size - just depends on how you want it to fit!
other I just scored this dress the other day and i don't regret it for a second. the bodice is beaded with some sea-foam green beads and they are sewn on really well, so i am not worried about dropping them all night. from the pictures, i couldn't tell if this was going to look like a cotton skirt or i fit would be chiffon looking-it is neither. it has a shimmer to it which makes this a more dressy looking dress than i was originally anticipating-i thought it was going to be an everyday wear type of d
3 The front and back of this square sweater are the same, and the pattern of the stitching makes it look like it's on backwards.the lace would be nice, but it's itchy. and the sweater is cropped, so i think the layered lace look is odd because the whole thing is so short on the body. the 3/other sleeves make it look small and fitted, but the body shape is bulky. just couldn't get it to work.
other This sweater tee is made from a fine but substantial knit which hangs beautifully and flows over imperfections in your figure. the cut is very 1950's through the sleeves and neckline. it's a little cropped and boxy, just so that it hides your belly and accentuates your hips. it looks phenomenal with a crinolined a-line skirt.
other Beautiful shirt for a great price. i love a good striped shirt and i got it on sale!
other I love the skirt! the color is beautiful, but i didn't love the fabric. it's too delicate and not great for a mom with two busy boys.
other I am 5'8" 140 lbs and the m fits perfectly. it is flowy and feminine but the tie in the back keeps it from looking boxy. pattern is really nice. great dress!
other The wide leg was fun, not too wide, but the long pocket seem to shorten leg so i returned. great for a taller person. bottom & trim cute
other The picture online doesn't do this pretty dress justice. i'm curvy, and always searching for dresses that don't make me look like a sack of potatoes. its pin tucks at the bust give it a little shape, and the print is much more vibrant in person. will look great with tights and a black blazer for dinners out.
other Such a pretty blouse, drapes nicely though it is a little on the large side. i got my usual medium and had to fix the straps a few times, but a fun summer top that makes you feel super feminine. maybe i could have sized down but i got it online on clearance so i didn't have the chance to try on another size. still love it!
other First of all, i've noticed that maeve is running big, i'm normally a size medium or 6 and two occasions now i've needed a size small and this is no different. of course i ordered the medium and would need to exchange it if i want it to fit better. it's loose allover. the only reason i'm not exchanging it is that the color washes my olive skin color. other than that it's a beautiful dress, it hist at the same spot on the leg as in the model's pictures. for reference, 5'9", 36b, 29", 38".
other The print and style of this dress is pure 60's. so fun! the black and white is especially striking. normally, i would wait a bit until the weather warmed up a bit more, but this dress is so cute and flattering, i just couldn't wait. the outer layer is actually sort of an open mesh. it's not extremely delicate, but could snag if you're not a bit careful. however, its the fabric that really makes it stand out so it's well worth it. i'd say the fit is true to size except if you're busty. i normally
other This is a beautiful dress (and my husband agrees). i'm 5'5", 114lb and the xs was long on me and a bit baggy on top. i looked in to having it taken up, but i think that will be hard to do without damaging much of what's elegant about the dress. i hope that someone with more curves and a bit more height is able to enjoy this one.
other The dress is a great buy especially since it was on sale. it fits like his other dresses flattering as i don't have a big bust and have a bit of extra skin from pregnancies but with this dress i feel amazing. get a ton of compliments when i wear it!
other I loved this top! the cinched in waist is so flattering. or i'll leave it un-cinched for a super relaxed fit. it's comfortable and light weight so i'll be wearing this into late spring/ early summer. i've worn it with the green pilcro slim pants, i've worn it unbuttoned over a basic black knee length jersey dress, i've worn it over a bathing suit in west palm beach. i can't wait to find more fun ways to wear it!
other I like to have a capsule wardrobe for all seasons so that when i travel, or just for everyday, i have a multitude of options with a few good quality pieces. i am not a fan of 'dry clean only' items, so anything that i can find that i can at least hand wash with good results and is within my color palette and sense of style is always a great find. this light weight cardi can work for multiple seasons easily, it is a tad boxy, but it actually works for me (5'4, 34c, 12other lbs) i can wear it with a c
other These pants are 100% true to size (whatever that means anymore...i'm a 26 in paige and ag.  i'm 5''6, weigh around 115, have long legs and i ordered the 0p.  the zero petite are still a little long, with a slight heel they're perfect.  they don't have stretch in them, but do to the fit and fabric...the material does expand, because they're thin and breezy.  i absolutely love them.  can't wait to order other colors of the same style.  these are my new favorite pants.
other Very beautiful colors unfortunately the cut is much too tent- like and it looks like a maternity top on me. i like a flowy bohemian top but this one was too much for my tastes, sadly i sent it back.
other I really wanted to love this shirt! the colors are gorgeous, very vibrant and just as shown. the fit was all wrong on me. i ordered the petite xxs and it was still too boxy. and, it kept shifting so the front collar of the shirt would ride up into my neck. it looked like a sack on me. for reference- i am 5'2", 112lbs...with a small frame.
other I was pleasantly surprised when i tried on this sweater. it is well made and fit perfect. the will really enjoy weather this in the fall.
other This sweater was just what i was looking for.  it is so soft & comfortable.  the design is unique and delicate, yet doesn't shed or itch.  the decorations are not as pure white as pictured, there are several different tones of ivories & creams.  i ordered the xs, which is my typical size in retailer sweaters, as i find that most run very large and this is no exception.  it is oversize, but not bulky.  however, the decorations do add some volume, so maybe not for all body types.
other I've had my eye on this poncho for weeks and finally scored the olive green one over thanksgiving/black friday special. i would say the color is more mustard yellow, which will go well with a variety of jewel-tone tops, etc. the poncho is a nice weight, but not too heavy. i am 4"1other with short arms, but i went ahead and bought the regular xs instead of the petite sizes and the length is perfect. i am seriously considering getting the cranberry one as well. a classic buy for winter which i'm sure
other Love these pants- they are so soft and comfortable- do not fall down like low rise trousers.  i like the length for wearing with flats - most wide bottom pants are too long, and these are very casual to be worn with flats.
other I was really disappointed when i tried this top on. the design and cut of the neckline is very bulky and just off. the cut of the top overall was just off.
other This blouse is very unique due to the pretty piped design on the back. looks great with jeans. the front is shorter and more tailored than the back. i love this blouse!
other These pants are even better in person. the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned.
other Really comfortable dress to wear.  pretty flower design.  good fabric and ribbon details are well placed. thankful it came with a cotton under slip because it's very sheer fabric and i didn't have to think of  what to put underneath.  have worn it twice since it shipped and i'm really happy with my purchase.  online order and shipment was super fast too.
other This jacket is a show stopper.  great fabric, beautiful embroidery.  well worth the price.
other This top is so soft and luxuriously comfy! i love wearing it around the house, haven't really "dressed" it up yet with jeans or jewelry. it runs slightly big, but if you like the oversized look, this is definitely perfect.
3 I love the pattern on this jacket and enjoy the bell shape. a fun jacket to through on and add quick style to a skinny pants.
3 This looks great on the model and is probably beat suited for someone that is tall and thin with small hips.
other Love this dress, it's comfortableand it can be worn casualties or formally.
3 This dress looked really nice on the hanger but when i put it on it was shorter than expected. i am 5'9 and it hit way above the knees. too short to be a work dress which was what i was hoping. might work better on someone shorter.
other I saw this in the kelly green color one size larger than my normal. it didn't look much but i was so drawn to the very pretty green color so i tried it on anyway. boy, am i really glad i did! this is more than just your basic everyday tee. the back has a very cute gingham pleating detail that hangs well when paired with a skinny jean or leggings. material was pretty substantial for a tee and definitely not see-through. i am a true m on most retailer tops and this one is pretty true to size. the on
other I have 3 pairs of these chinos i love them so much. they come soft like a well-worn favorite but are high quality at a great price. i'm typically a size 4. i bought the 26 size but think i could have gone down to a 25. otherwise very happy with this purchase!
other Love this t-shirt. the weight is great for the impending heat and humidity of summer. it looks positively fabulous for casual occasions with pilcro chinos in moss and fuchsia suede pumps.
other This jacket is perfect for fall! lightweight and easily worn over other tops or layers. looks great with jeans!
other I knew i had to have this as soon as i saw it pop up in the tops section. it's effortless. love the quirky design and the overall fit. it's a tad on the large side, but i'm all about the flow these days. oh, and the poms at the bottom about sent me over the edge. fantastic piece.
other Yes, this is a great dress! i wasn't sure about it online because of the color combination. i think i would have preferred the gray color but it was sold out. it received very good reviews online so i thought it was worth the risk at the sale price. i am always on the hunt for great dresses at great prices (who isn't?!). once i received it and tried it on, oh wow! i love it. it is so flattering. it is a very pretty dress. i think i will wear this all the time. i am actually thinking of all the d
other So much right but then....too short.
other Too tight in strange ways. beautiful dress i was so excited to receive it, however it just did not fit.
other I love this shirt. it would be a fairly basic tee but the neckline makes it fun. it's very soft and comfortable. i bought the white with blue pattern and will probably purchase additional colors.
other I don't own any peach outerwear because i didn't think it would complement my skintone. this cozy bomber proved me wrong. wonderful quilting pattern and a vintage dye job that's eye catching. great for layering and the color goes with my autumn and spring wardrobe. this is not a fitted style, it's relaxed and a bit poufy at the sleeves and waist, just like a regular bomber jacket. i chose medium petite and it fits just right. i'm a 36d, 135#, 38-28-35.
other This velvet t-shirt is perfect for the holidays! i usually wear a size 1other top, or a l, but i ordered up and got a size xl. it is very tight around my chest (36c) and armpits, and the v-neck sometimes spreads apart a lot if i move my arms around a lot. but other than that, it looks great, just runs small. if you are a size 1other or larger, i don't think that this will fit.
other I tried this on even though i usually am not interested in cowlneck tops. the fabric is heavier, so it is not good for hot weather. the fabric is a weave of lighter and darker colors - you can see if you zoom in, so it has an interesting texture. very flattering because it is fitted and not boxy.
other I passed over this dress online thinking i'd never wear it. but, then i found myself inside an retailer store and decided to try it on. i am excited to say that i love this dress. it is soft and lovely. the cowl is large and the whole dress has a really great drape. my favorite thing is that the buttons along the back are functional. opening up the back turns this dress into a long cardigan that is to die for.
other I ordered these in m (5'8" 140 lbs.) and they are tts: they fit well and are neither tight nor loose. the issue that i have with them (and the reason that i sent them back) is that the material, although comfortable, is completely transparent; if i were to try to run out to get the mail in these, the whole neighborhood would essentially see me bottomless! furthermore, these are not white but off-white (and quite a yellowy off-white, at that), so these loungers don't look as cute with the feature
other Love these! loose and comfy everywhere. delighted to have found a 32, and delighted that they are roomy, even at the waist. i exchanged another pair of pilcro's and was afraid of a shipping/pricing conflict, but as usual, retailer customer service was excellent. earlier sale price was honored, easy returns in the orignal shipping bag.. retailer design, fashion and company attitude excels!
other Love this t-shirt. i rarely pay full price but love this and it's already out of stock. fits perfect. i tend to be short waisted so the length is perfect.
other I ordered the black and it was a soft black, which i loved. i felt like the shirt was a little boxy (i was hoping the top would have been a bit more fitted (the arm holes are loose) and the bottom a little longer, but i like it enough that i am keeping it. works well to wear to work.
other I love these pilcro cropped chinos. i ordered them in the sand and will be ordering them in the grey. they are very soft and comfortable
other It's a pretty top, but it runs very short. the back is also pretty see through so i'm not sure i will keep it. it's called off the shoulder but it is so tight when you try and actually wear it off the shoulder. great design, just not sure i will keep it due to length
other I love the way these jeans look and fit, but they have a chemical smell. i assumed the odor would go away after i washed them, but it doesn't seem to have helped.
other I bought this dress to wear to my graduation where i was receiving a degree in horticulture. i also just had a child a few weeks prior and was worried about sizing. the high waist worked well for the post pregnancy belly. i am 5'3" and was typically around 130 lbs pre-pregnancy which was typically a other in dresses. i ordered a 6 petite in this dress and it was perfect! the only area that was sort of tight was the bosom but i am nursing so i expected as much. the petite length was perfect for my he
other I bought these on a whim on mother's day when i was out shopping. i didn't try even try them on at the store. i got them home and couldn't believe how great they fit and how comfortable they were. the length is perfect for me. not too long or too short. they did stretch out a bit upon wearing them but i like the comfortable, relaxed look. i washed and dried them in the dryer. they came out perfect. i bought the coral color. will be buying more as it is hard to find shorts that work for me. i rec
other The perfect dress for dinner date or summer weddings. or traveling. love this dress. not sure on washing yet since it is a silk dress. extremely comfortably and beautiful. i can't recall the last time i bought a new dress.
other Very cute shorts. sadly, after one wash they became a lint magnet so had to be returned. disappointing quality.
3 True to size on the neckline and arms but extremely large and puffy in the torso. very unflattering cut!
other I wanted this sweater to work but sadly it failed. first, the pink was way to sheer for my liking. the sheerness caused a weird color overlap on the stomach area. then the band at the bottom was too tight causing a weird ballooning affect. a shirt underneath could work but it takes away from the beauty of the knit. the soft pink is gorgeous but not good for medium to light skinned folks.
other These are long, easily wear with skinny jeans, they do not cling and are not see through! the colors are great!
other I ordered this dress in 0p since i am 5ft. it fits great its not too short just above the knee.
other Incredibly soft and comfortable, not as fitted as i would like (this often happens to me with skinny pants, though). i want to wear these guys everyday!
other I am 5'2" 12other pounds and i bought the 4p. the fabric is high quality and does not cling at all but instead drapes and in a very flattering way. add that to the cut of this jumpsuit and you have elongating, very flattering lines. i could not be more pleased and regret not having bought this item earlier, since i would have enjoyed wearing it during the holidays. as other reviewers said, it is adorable and a winner.
other The beautiful bold print drew me to this top and it did not disappoint upon receipt. however, the bottom ruffle belled so far out on each side that it was laughable! the actual fit is nothing like the picture; clearly the model's arms are placed in front of all the extra fabric to hold the ruffle back.however, the fabric is beautiful, the fit was perfect (size 2, 5'4", 106 lbs.), the quality is great and i love the print so i decided to take it to my tailor to "sew away" the "wings" on both si
other I was so excited to order this sweater. i thought that the moss color would make it a great basic for work or casual days. ordering it on sale made it all the better. however, when it came i was so sad to see how muted the colors were, with little definition. the sweater itself lacks definition as well, just shapeless and hangy. i also did not expect the angora like hair on the sweater which bothered by eyes as soon as i tried it on.
other I loved this dress. it fit perfectly everywhere except for the sleeves. the dress has an overall relaxed fit, but the sleeves were way too tight. i had to send back because of sleeves.
other This pullover blouse is a real winner. it is soft and figure flattering, but not too clingy. the neck looks good open or closed with the small button. all in all, it's just a very good design. note that the notched thumb holes are completely optional. the holes disappear, without being visible, into the sleeve when they are not being used. also, the sleeve pulls down when the thumb holes are used, so there is no extra length in the sleeves (as may be suggested in the photo).
other I really like this dress. despite the somewhat gathered skirt, it has a clean line and doesn't add a lot of volume around the hips. the blue is a great color. the length is well above the knee but i'm 5'10". i can see wearing this dress in the fall with leggings or tights and boots.
other I usually wear size other but the other was perfect, other would have definitely been loose. really nice zipper in the back, this skirt is thick and has a stiff/bouncy construction to it due to the neoprene which i was worried would make me look large but it is still soft enough that it doesn't do that. i usually have to get petite for retailer and this was no exception, the nonpetite goes beyond my knees awkwardly...strangely enough, my only criticism for this is that the outer shell seems to get largish w
other This skirt is going to be perfect for the hot texas summers. super lightweight and floaty, and the pattern is so gorgeous. will go great with my favorite purple shoes!
3 I ordered this in lime, which is one of my fave colors. the garment was loose and roomy, and had the designer used elastic anywhere on the waist, i would have been in love! the shoulders were only tight due to the lack of flexibility in the bottom - no elastic at the waist and no placket below the waist to increase the ease of mobility taking the garment on and off - so if i had to use the ladies' room, i had to plan ahead. i took it on a trip and didn't have time to try on prior to leaving.
other I honestly bought this shirt on a whim the other day in my local retailer. i was drawn to the color and the swing. first of all, this shirt is incredibly soft and lightweight. i love the flow of the loose peplum. the straps are nicely placed, because they're wider and accentuate my arms (and cover my bra straps). i love the little v neck detail. it shows a little cleavage when bent or hunched over, but the top stays conservative when truly upright. i wore this shirt 3 days in a row last week, and
other I had my eye on this dress since it fist came out, but hesitated to order due to some of the lower reviews. when i got a chance to try it on - i loved it! i did go up a size. i am 5'5" so i had it shortened to above the knee, i didn't mind losing the unfinished hem - had the hem match that of the pockets. i am a 34c but the bodice is stable and even if i pull at it, it stays put! so happy to find this, especially on sale! i plan to wear it at our company party which is help on a large charter bo
other I love this sweater! timeless--classical with an edge! i will have it until the end.
other This is an awesome tank top, comfortable, great fit, casual but with ruffles a bit dressier than an ordinary tank top. i loved it so much i came back and bought it in the cream color. this runs a bit larger and i typically take an extra large but bought this in large and its perfect.
other This is a very pretty, particularly youthful dress.  but, do be forewarned, it is gigantic.  size down even if you never do, and get a petite if you are even a little short.  i didn't size down enough and it was both wide and long -- it looked ridiculous.  i am petite, and the hem went way below my knees (and the dress was considerably longer than the slip).
other I bought this with the intention of taking it on a very warm trip - and i think it'll do just fine! it's a wonderful open-gauge knit - delicate and light, but substantial enough that i don't fear snagging it constantly. the cloth has a nice weight and drape, and while the fit is on the loose side, it does look intentional. wonderful as a pullover or by itself. i have the minty blue-green color, and it's divine. definitely worth the price.
other I have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive. this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat. the sleeves are very wide (although long). as a light weight fall coat the sleeves don't need to be as wide because you wouldn't be layerng too much underneath. the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit. i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh
other I have this top in the blue print and i love it. i'm super tempted to buy it in the black as well since i love it so much, but it might be a little pricy to have two of the same top. the only thing i will warn women about this top is that if you are busty then i would recommend going up a size. i wear a small in most retailer clothes but i went for a medium in this top. while the small did fit in al other areas, it looked like the buttons were going to pop at my bust.
other When i first tried this top on, i didn't like it because the chest just spilled open. i saw it on someone else and it was so flattering i gave it another try. i bought it in both the red and the black, and plan to put a stitch or safety pin through the top to keep it closed. it is very slimming and hides tummy/muffin top issues. i plan to wear it with the stretchy knee length maeve pencil skirts all summer, along with shorts and pants. give this one a try!
other Tried this one because the ruffled detailing at the collar and sleeves appealed to me, as well at the cute button details along the back and the overall color and look of it._____________pros:- love the ruffle trim along the collar, bottom, and wrists. it gives it a really romantic feel to it.- a definite winter piece. it's extremely warm and very thick and heavy, which i found covered any lumps and bumps nicely.- ran tts. i'm 5'9", 36c, hourglass, and 170 lbs and tried on the medium and fo
other So this is available in the store in a reddish coral color, see the #your retailer pictures and you'll see someone wearing it under the gray blazer. anyway, i tried it on and the fit was very flattering for a tunic. the front of the sweater hit me just at the waist and the front draped nicely. somehow the back was slightly hugging my back side but not tight or restricted. i ended up ordering the black and navy online because the fit was fantastic and will go with so many things. nothing shee
3 I love the maeve line and was excited to get this dress. unfortunately, the fit was just bad. the top fit fine but the bottom half was too snug and there were unattractive gaps around the waist and the pockets. don't think another size or tailoring would address the issue. for size, i am 5'4", 130 and ordered the 6.
other Love this blazer. you can wear it with anything. fits well and lightweight. perfect for south florida.
other Unlike the other two reviews , i found this dress horrid. i ordered a xs since i am between that and a s. it was just too much fabric for me. . i have a small frame, so it was just so overwhelming, the armholes were big and i felt like i had a bag on me. colors were nice and fabric was soft and light.. the belt made no sense as others have said. length was good. i tried it on as soon as i got it and couldn't take it off fast enough. i literally ran to the post office and back it goes. this is my
other Cute spring dress. fit can be a little challenging if you have a full bust. however, print is so beautiful. the material is soft. i liked the puff in the sleeve. it made the look more unique.
other Probably the most comfortable jeans i have ever owned. they are more comfortable even than yoga leggings. they look and fit like real jeans while feeling like loungewear. i have nothing negative to say about them.
other The cut is perfect and the rose color is so pretty!  it fits like the typical left of center sizing.  i wish it came in more colors!
other Dress fits perfectly and is extremely comfortable. great for day or evening. love it!,
other I purchased this is off white and it is a stunner! feminine? check! stylish? check! hem hits at a flattering part of the body? check! great with jeans or tailored pants? check! i cannot say anything bad about this blouse-well, maybe the button back is a little convenient but it sure looks pretty! i am 5' 21/2" and 110 pounds and usually wear a 0 or other but i purchased in a size other and it fits perfectly! can't wait to wear this with my olive green skinny jeans!
other I generally love pilcro pants and these are no exception. the fabric is heavy but soft, the color is so vivid but still easy to mix with other top combinations. they are comfortable and flattering. i am 5'2" and these are not crops on me, with the rolled up hem they are a perfect full length pant but that works well for me.
other I saw this online and immediately purchased the top in gray. it's so easy and casual but the shoulder detailing give it something different and unique for a regular gray shirt. the fit is loose and comfortable but not overly big, just right. i can't wait to pair it with my new white jeans for summer!
other I wanted to love this dress! the material is beautiful! but sadly i agree with other reviewer. the model definitely has this pinned back! i am on the small side (5'5", 120 lbs, straight figure, very tiny "girls") and this dress looked awful. totally swallowed what little shape i have and the swing did make me look prego in front and back. the fabric is stiff so i think that adds to the sticking out oddly. as far as sizing the arm jokes fit great. xs ordered and length was good but wish the "swin
other I wore this dress for an after party the day of my wedding day in new orleans. going to a music lounge!! seriously, i kept getting compliments!!! it's fits beautiful and i just love the different type of patterns!
other I seriously love this skirt! i bought it for my college graduation and i was complimented by everyone that saw it. not only that, but it is beyond versatile, you can dress it up, make it casual, or make it professional. it is extremely ideal especially for the price. it also is the most comfortable skirt i've ever worn, so that's a plus.
other This is my new favorite dress. it's a lovely fall mustard shade. the design really accentuates the waistline. i would buy the other colors in a heartbeat. on my petite frame the dress hits just above my knees.
3 At the beginning of summer, i first ordered one of these tops in size xl. i liked the colors and the material was such a soft, open weave. i thought it would be perfect for the hot weather so i ordered a 2nd on sale. unfortunately, even though these are made of mesh, these tops ended up being really hot. i wore them in texas, new york, new jersey, and florida. i thought they'd be a good, pretty choice. but, the material with the gathered waist & wrists, trapped in the heat. it was just too sheer
other I got this on sale. i sized up from my normal 10 to a 1other based on reviews. the 1other is too large for me and i'd need a 10 which is sold out. the straps are very long. i think even if i sized down, i'd have to have them altered. also, the dress i got is missing the bottom button. sending back. i'm not too sad, i ordered the pink pippa swing dress with the same order and love it.
other This is an amazing top. fits perfectly, beautiful detail, and amazing fabric. i actually came back to the site just so i could order it in all available colors, but unfortunately it's only in navy. don't hesitate to buy this!
other I must say that at first i had mixed feelings about this sweater. i was actually going to return it because i was unsure about the style and color. the color is to me like a lavender mauv-ish color but the description is actually "natural" . i must admit that in some light it looks more brown then lavender . regardless i think that in itself tells you that this sweater is not like any other. i actually wear it as a coat and its become an essential part of my wardrobe. i found the size to be true
other I saw this sweater on-line and loved it until i tried it on. i'm 5-7, flat chested, 13other pounds and i ordered a size small. the sweater fit everywhere except for my arms. this sweater will work great if you are short. consider making your sweaters a little longer, because i do not consider myself tall.
other The dress is cute, but i'm somewhat concerned that it will be sheer in the sunlight. i guess we'll have to wait and see!
other This dress is so beautiful in person. i actually am currently wearing it with jeans and i get so many compliments on it. this picture on the website does not really do it justice. very flowy beautiful top/dress.
other I ordered this online, and when i opened the package, i was impressed with the quality of the material and stitching for this top. it is much nicer than a basic t-shirt.when i tried this on, the band of stitching that was supposed to go beneath my chest was sitting on top of my cleavage! also, the overall length is listed as 27" long, but i think that is the back of the shirt. the front of the shirt is very short on me (i'm 5'10"), hitting well above my hip bones.if only this was much, m
other Love the unique stitching on the shirt and the dye job.  i think it does run a little big.  the arm holes are quite deep even in a medium, but the fabric is thin so a tank underneath would probably work out well.
3 Loved this shirt but it runs pretty big. i'm normally a sm/med due to bust size (34ddd) and ordered a small based on other reviews. could have gotten an x-small. debating going to exchange. i ordered it in three colors bc it was on sale. better quality than some at retailer.
other Saw this skirt in the sale room and figured i'd give it a try. i'm always looking for comfortable skirts that aren't too tight around the waist. once i zipped it up, i knew it would be a keeper! the waist band is super comfortable and it has a hook/eye closure as well. the material is a little heavier weight, but that's fine it can work for winter as well. it's soft, yet structured. the pockets are always a plus. if you want to step away from the normal shapes and colors, this is out of the box
3 But-the problem is i cannot get the color to stay below the shoulders. the large appeal of this top is the over the shoulder look-but in just trying it on it would pop off the shoulders and make a cowl neck kind of top that didn't lay right. if it would have stayed it would have been a real win for me. i like the quality of the fabric and the longs sleeves, but i can't get the desired look to work out so this is going back.
other I loved this shirt online but when it came to my house i loved it even more. super comfy and really flattering! i love it!!! runs true to size!
other Love this sweater! you can wear it with just about everything. i have worn it with dresses, leggings and jeans. you can dress it up or down. wonderful quality for the price.
other I am normally a medium and i would take an xs in this top - i actually tried a m, s and xs and the xs fit but was still big. yes, this is supposed to be a loose draped piece, but for me, i didn't want it to make me look like i was huge through the waist line. the red is really pretty, the white is see thru.
3 I really wanted this to work. the embroidery detail is very pretty. however, the inside of the sweatshirt is a bit scratchy from the embroidery so i would recommend wearing a cami or tank. the sweatshirt is also on the short size. the small hit the top of my jean waist. in the end, i decided to return it:(
other Love these jeans! so comfortable and the high waist is great for my long torso. these are real denim, not the thin stretchy legging type jeans. they fit true to size on me-  i am 5'4" 120 pounds and i wear a 26. they were a little long so i chopped them off to hit just above the ankle
other Absolutely love the design, fabric, and fit of this dress! a perfect dress for many occasions, one of the many reasons i love this company! excellent customer service, employees, and of course adorable clothing. 10/10 would recommend buying this dress! and to all the taller girls, i am 5'11" and 170lbs and this dress is still a good length! no need to continuously pull down and worry about who might see your rear.
other This caught my eye in the store because of the beautiful bell sleeves so i had to try it on. i tried on an xs and small to see what fit better. for me, i am 5"3' and about 120 lbs, the xs fit better. i usually do take an xs in tops. i wore it out recently with a pair of distressed jeans and it looked great. as with most of the items you see online it is always better to see it in person as the pictures do not do it justice. the material was nice and flowy. i did not feel the neckline was too low
other This is a very cute and unique top!! i absolutely love the back, which makes up for my indifference of the front. i'm a little heavier in the middle, so it hides it a bit, but the light blue from the back that shows on the sides makes me feel a little wider. it's not perfect, but i like it enough to keep it. i got lots of compliments on it when i wore it. it's very comfortable too. i just wish the front had a little more to it or was a tad longer. overall very happy.
other I have had a lot of complements while wearing this dress. i purchased it in the grey. other reviews felt that this dress ran large. i agree that it might be a little larger than other retailer purchases i have made but not by much. i purchased it in small (usually what i wear in dresses) i'm very tall at 5'9" (mostly legs) and the length is great. also the neck line is perfect on me and i have a fairly average torso length. . i am very happy with the purchase.
other I ordered my normal size 32. they were a little tight however i'm glad because they normally stretch out quite a bit so i'm assuming they should fit perfect after one wearing. the length is fine for my 5'9 height and they are very soft.. i'm so happy with the light red color, it's almost a rust which i love.
other This shirt is very flattering on. it's perfect to wear to work and also in a casual setting. it is rather short so it would be best to pair it with high rise pants!
other Love, love, love this dress! i needed a fun but not over the top dress for family pictures and this was perfect. great pop of color and looked amazing with over the knee boots. i see myself wearing this thru the holidays and will likely throw on with a jean jacket. i found it true to size - my normal size other fits me well. buy this dress - you won't regret it!
other Shimmery & lightweight t-shirts. i got the aqua & brown t's. good for layering.
other I knew i had to have these when i saw them on one of the retailer store instagrams. i bought them in the blue color combo and they are very comfortable and can be dressed up for work or paired with more casual clothing because of the material. they run a little large and have a lot of stretch so i would size down.
other This is a beautiful knit dress, however it runs large, so be wary. for reference i am a 34d, 28 inch waist, and 4other inch hips. i ordered a medium because dresses usually run tight around my bum, and it was very, very big. i'm hoping the small is much more flattering because the quality of the knit is very nice.
other I was looking for the full legged pants with a slit, light enough for the beach. they have my size finally! i'm a regular 1other and m worked well for me. can't wait to wear these with a nice top.
other Perfect sweater to throw on with anything. it is fairly thin, i wore a cami underneath. the sleeves and hem are rolled. you have to be careful and it can snag easily. happy with my purchase.
3 I bought these shorts last week in the cobalt blue color. they are super comfy and the color is beautiful however after wearing them for only a few hours i noticed a pull in the fabric that all the way down the front of the right leg. i'm extremely upset about this because they were relatively expensive for lounge shorts. i love the shorts otherwise.
3 This would be perfect if only it were lined!!!! i have a high waist and hourglass shape so jumpers are very hard to find that fit my body type. this is a perfect fit for my body shape and when on, it looks like a lovely dress. however, it is not lined and the material is very light and ivory so you see everything. you can't wear a slip so that leaves the option of some sort of bodysuit if you don't want to show the world what you have. i am very tired of all of the light colored clothing not bei
3 This is a lightweight knit dress that is well-designed but very form-fitting. i decided to return it because at almost 40 there are parts of my body that i don't need to show, but if you're in great shape or willing to wear shape wear, this would be super cute.
other Love the colors on this adorable, flattering style!
other The blouse is absolutely beautiful. i am 5' and the length is perfect. even though it fit a little snug across the chest, it's a keeper. i'll wear it open on the top with a nice cami underneath.
3 As with most retailer tops, this sweater is boxy and baggy through the middle.  i ordered an xs.  it's a very nice, pretty sweater that i'm going to try in an xxs.  the v-neck does go down rather low so it will need a tank underneath. the lace accents are very delicate and make the sweater look more upscale.  the white is a soft winter white.
other When i saw this on a model at my retailer store, i fell for it. i love the colors and the weave of this kimono. it looks great over anything denim or chambray in particular. it will be useful for cooler days and nights or air-conditionied places. the knit cuffs hold it in place. i got many compliments on it the first time i wore it.
other I purchased this jacket in a pxs, as i am 5'2" and 110lbs. the sleeve length is perfect! the fabric is soft and lightweight, which is perfect for living in southern california. i don't feel any itchiness either. the rest of the jacket fits me perfectly and hits right at the top of my hips. there are two cute grommets on each side at the bottom by the hem, which add nicely to the look. i like how the sleeves are ribbed, giving it a comfy sweater feel. there's also two zippered pockets, whic
other I love this dress! i was worried it would swallow my petite frame but it is flowy yet flattering. i have worn it to several different occasions. it looks great with tights and boots and just flats. the lace detailing makes it unique.
other Love! color and fabric are beautiful! new fav
other I am very happy with this suit! it is gorgeous and very well made. my only suggestion is to use your normal swimsuit size when ordering rather than their recommendations. i am a 4-6 in dress size but am curvy with a large bust. i went with a medium because i thought there was no way i would wear a small! the medium actually fits great in the waist and bottom, however is small in the top for me. i'm ordering a large to compare coverage.
other I love jeans!!! especially this pair. perfect fit, hugs in all the right places. perfect length! worn it 3x already! and it gets better every time you wear it. goes great with a cute too!
other Im normally a medium across the board for outerwear. (5'8" and 13other lbs) this jacket looked giant from the photos so i bought a small. when i first tried it on i thought no way, it's gotta go back. it was enormous and the fit was rather awkward. i looked like the size of a house from all angles. ha! i was still in love with the color and print. as i wore it around the house it began to loose it's rigidity and form against my body in places. it is definitely a jacket you got to play around with. d
other I was lucky enough to hit retailer day in san diego and snagged this little number - it is truly better looking in person. the dress hugs in all the right places and actually fits tighter than the model shows, but the material is that soft, but stretchy and gently molds to the shape of your body. i was really surprised, i would have never tried this dress from the photo shown. so glad i went in - it's really adorable!
other I'm a petite so as usual i have to order from retailer. i saw this on line and tried it on in a regular size in the store. even though of course it didnt fit, the style of the tee was nice so i ordered it. i couldnt have been more disappointed when i received it. the quality was truly awful. i'm not even sure why it is being sold. the neckline was warped and wouldn't lie flat again the neck or chest; the bottom hem was crooked. it was really bad. also having purchased tees in similar material befo
other This top is beautifully detailed , it is flattering and i am very happy with my purchase!
other These shorts are divine. the fabric is sturdy and there is a weave of sparkle that i did not perceive from the picture.
other I wasnt expecting this top to be so soft and comfortable and breezy! i am usually an xs petite, but based on reviews i got the regular small. it is a little loose, but the length is perfect. i am short for reference (5'2, 107 lb, 32c). the buttons gaped a very tiny bit, like a centimeter, but not to the point where any skin or bra was visible. had i got the xsp, i think the gaping would have been an issue. the arms are too baggy for my taste (length is ok though), but i fold the sleeves up at th
other I am 5'8" size 4-6 us. i could barely zip the inside bra on the 8. i wear 3other b. i think it is uk sizing. i kept the 8 ( had to return the 6). it's a beautiful dress but it is a lot of dress. maybe too much for someone more petite. it looks ridiculous until you put the belt on:)
3 I picked up this t-shirt at my local retailer today, immediately drawn to the super cute, colorful graphics, and the unique stitching at the collar, saying "giddy up!" to go with the cowboys, horses, cacti, and movie camera, (unusually!). the graphics are way cuter in person, as compared to the weirdly wavy-distorted and unclear photos shown online. if all i had seen was these photos, i would never have even noticed or recognized the design. go to your local store to see this in person, and you wi
other More flattering than it looks on the model. comes in at the waist on me. i ordered it in blue, and it's very pretty; will go nice with a business suit but requires a cami underneath for work occasions.
other This is an amazing sweater. thick but not overly thick, the material is beautiful and the colors rich, i love the collar and the way it closes as well as the pockets and the back being different from the front. i hope it washes well. i bought the moss. it fits nicely and is very slimming. i highly recommend.
other This dress is everything i hoped it would be. it is soft and comfortable, and flattering even though it's not tight fitting. true to size as well.
3 I wanted to love this dress - it is gorgeous on the model, but unfortunately for me, it didn't fit right. i'm petite and ordered the xxs petite. it was snug in the upper body and looked like i was wearing a baby-doll dress. the material is high quality and i love the burnt red color. it just didn't fit right. definitely looks great on the model, but hung funny on me. i can see why it was highly rated, gorgeous dress - just not on me.
other This dress fits well and is comfortable. my only reflection is that i am 5'9" and it hits at my mid shin, rather than where it appears on the model.
other Love the style of this vest, and an added bonus is how soft it is. every vest is different, though, so if you're shopping in the store, be sure to look at all of them.
other This is a fantastic dress. it's very flowy, comfortable, stylish, and it has pockets!!! whoop! whoop! i have a larger bust (34d) and even though it's button down, the openings in between don't peak open to show your bra. it is navy and red, but i think you could wear black boots with it, no problem. this is my new favorite dress and i'm very happy with my purchase. buy it!!
other Agree with other reviewers : this dress is surprisingly nice weight/quality fabric. it's also very swingy. i find i am usually a size 10 in hd in paris items (m in deletta and s/m in meadow rue, for comparison) since i'm a 34d i find hd in paris items to leave too little room for larger busts so i size up. in this dress i'm going to try for the m, since the l i ordered was too big, the swingyness leaves lots of room if you are an hourglass shape and the sleeves were roomy without being too big.
other I typically wear an xs to s in tops and purchased an xs for a less flowy fit.  this top has a luxurious feel and the green color is really beautiful (more matte than shiny).  perfect piece to wear under a jacket or blazer.
other Colors are vibrant (i ordered the blue color combo) material is light and feels great against your skin.
other Basic ribbed white tank with a little character in the back. could easily be dressed up or down, material is soft and light and has a slight stretch. i will be getting a lot of use out of this piece.
other Loved this blouse when i received it after ordering online! the cut and style of the blouse is so cute and looks great with jeans. it is well made but it is see-through so i had to wear something under it. otherwise, really flattering, unique design!
other This sweater is very cute. i got a medium, i'm broad in the shoulders and a 34c. i wanted it a little loose. threw it over a tshirt and was not itchy at all. i feel it is light weight and perfect for our mild winters in florida. can't wait till the weather cools down to wear it.
other I have featured two pictures below. one is size s. the other is xs petite. i'm other feet 120 and a 3other d. i highly recommend this dress. i definitely could have gone either way. but felt sizing down would be more flattering.
other I purchased this in the green. nice print, not overwhelming. slips on, hides a bra, and was simply comfortable to wear. can easily be dressed up or down, but i was looking for a dress that i could slip on at the last minute to go out to dinner with friends. i took it on a trip to florida, and it did not wrinkle in my suitcase. what more can you ask for?
other I love to shop at retailer for tops that i can wear everyday. they always seem to have pieces that are comfortable, casual, and quite different from what you would find in most stores. this top is exactly that! it fits true to size and is washable. all you need are jeans, boots and a neutral necklace and you are good to go. you can't go wrong if you purchase this top!
other I like these jeans. when i wore them, i received compliments. they do run large. i sized down one size, but probably could have sized down two sizes. they feel tight when you first put them on, but as you wear them, they loosen up and i find myself pulling them up to meet my waist. my other complaint is a small one. the embroidered flower on the knee rubs against your knee as you move. after awhile, my right knee felt like it had a carpet burn on it. that is why i gave this only other stars for desi
other This reminds me of a kimono or poncho rather than a "cardigan" but that aside its a beautiful sweater. the feel of it is luxurious and is soft and comfortable. i would size down at least one size. i'm usually a medium to large and i bought the small. i gave this piece other stars because it is a touch boxy. it's seems like a piece i'll throw on with jeans and wear to a casual dinner in the fall. definitely a fall/winter item.
other This would be one of my favorite shirts if the neckline were straight across instead of cut, or if it at least had a button. it runs large so the low neck plus bagginess makes it feel too loose for my taste, even though i ordered the xs. the back of the sweater is also really long. it's a comfortable fabric and nice quality though.
3 I bought this tank for work, but the color of the print is slightly muted compared to the photo. i usually wear a xxs or xs (i am 100 lbs, 5'1) and i got the xs thinking it will be loose, which i wanted. the arm holes were down to my waist, and it was also unusually wide. the quality of the fabric is nice though, not to heavy and not too thin.
other Got several compliments on the dress the first time i wore it, and know it will work well for both the office, church and even a holiday party or two. i'm right on the line between petite & regular sizes, and could have gone w/a petite (probably medium) size instead as the dress is just a touch long with a deeper neckline for my frame. otherwise it fits well and the color is great, even if it's not quite the same as in the photo. overall, i'm satisfied with my purchase!
3 I love this dress and bought it in the store in the orange, without trying it on as i usually wear a 1other in this brand.  the over-dress is beautiful, however the under-slip is very tight and is apparently made for some one who has no bust at all.  i am so sad and am considering returning it or re-sewing the slip in some way so that it fits.  not sure what to do. don't want to spoil the color combo by wearing something different underneath, but it is so sheer you need something.
other This dress is attractive but it runs a little small. i'm a small curvy girl who usually wears a 2. this was small in the top and short waisted. i wanted to wear it to a recent event and didn't have time to return it for another size.
other I usually size up with this brand. small was perfect for me at 135lbs. this top has a luxurious but casual feel and beautiful. i am obsessed and want to wear it everyday. it wears a little long and drapey but a little tight where it rolls up in the arms.
3 This dress is adorable. it simply did not fi off the rack.i invested 1other dollars in alterations to get rid of the very bottom side pockets- why where they even there? and to shape the bottom. basically the dress is straight all the way down the sides.by up and alter....the top pattern and cut at the top made the alteration investment worth it to me- the quality of the fabric is excellent.and the pattern is adorable- can be worn as little black dress, cocktail party or date night. the top de
other Wear the collar down & it favors grace kelly. pull it up and it's an oversized hood. this lightweight cozy piece combines everything i love about a sweater & a coat in one.
other The fabric is very light weight, more of a shirting material.  this surprised me because the dark flowers almost looked like flocked velvet in the picture.  the flowers are actually printed on cotton that has woven stripes.  it is so soft and light!  there is also a little webbing detail in the front yoke but nothing shows because there is a simple sewn in lining.  the skirt is not lined but the hem is weighted with a trim so that the skirt will hang right.  very flattering.  it does run big tho
other Soft very forgiving and flattering top, wish it was not so pricey
other Fit review: i ordered the size 27 as i read alexa chung jeans run small, and my usual size in ag stevie is a 26 in cords, 27 in some jeans..i'm 5'2", currently 25" waist, 33" high hip, 37.25" at the widest, 29" inseam. i have more of a pear shape than an hourglass, flatter stomach, bigger upper thighs and bottom. i'm long-waisted and do have some high-rise trousers that look great, which is why i risked paying shipping on these..the 27 was loose at my natural waist, the jeans measuring 29.5"
other Love, love, love these leggings! a soft, colorful, comfortable way to show your artistic flare.
other This is an adorable topper for all these ballgowns when you have no top. that said, it was a lot shorter on me than i expected. i attribute this to the fact that i have a chest. the fit is true to size, but while not showing much tightness around the chest to any gape in the buttons in the back, it became more of a crop top. i have been needing a short topper so i'm definitely keeping this. the back button detail is adorable. the lace for me is soft and not stratchy or irritating but i only trie
other I can't wait for the first signs of fall so i can wear this! the fabric is a nice light weight and the fit is very flattering. as another interviewer commented, it can also be worn as a dress. well worth the investment!!
other Pilcro runs one size smaller this year - i compared with pants that i ordered last year and sure enough, one inch difference in waist. i did not notice difference in other dimensions of this garment, so my best guess is that pilcro decided to make tighter waist due to some complaints last year about waist being ?too lose?. i personally prefer sporty silhouette and am not thrilled with this change, but pants fit and are nice color and quality, so they stay. however, i am not sure i would order th
other This top is so pretty and feminine. the different floral patterns work very well together and add an interesting flare to this unique blouse. the fit is very comfortable yet still very flattering due to the empire waist and flared sleeves. the fit is true to size, i usually wear a size medium or 10 in retailer tops and the size 10 fit quite nicely. this top is a great addition to any spring wardrobe and should transition nicely into summer as well.
other I adore this top - so cute, flattering, and easy to dress up or down. yes, it is a little better suited for larger chests, but i personally don't mind a discreet pin for this beauty. i'm a 34a and slim build, and the only issue is when i bend forward - it falls beautifully otherwise. great with everything from a black pencil skirt to jeans and a black leather jacket...cute with denim jacket and white pants too. easy wardrobe piece.
other I tried this sweater on in the store, regretted not purchasing it, and ended up buying it online. the fabric is soft, seems to be good quality, and hangs nicely. i purchased the taupe color and it is a rich, pretty color.
other This dress didn't do much for me on the hanger but it was on sale and thought i would try it on in the store. so glad i did, definitely cuter on than just hanging there. the back has a belt feature that adds a little structure. the colors are nice and bright. will be good for our hot austin summers.
other The top does run large around the upper waist area. arms fits perfectly for athletic shoulders and biceps! the sleeves come about other inches shy of the wrist. the embroidery is lovely and the material is very soft but is pretty thin. overall i am very happy that this tunic is actually a tunic! the length goes below the butt and is a very cute buy.
other I found this blouse to be just a lovely spring and summer top. the netting in back adds interest and the dusky peach floral print is extremely pretty. the tiered layers add a slimming effect and it can be worn casual or for dress. it could even be worn in the fall with the right sweater. i just love it and feel so feminine when i wear it.
other I love this! i agree with previous post that say  it is much better in person. the fabric is high quality but not too thick. i bought this to have something light to wear on a trip to italy and it will be perfect. the color is so lovely and the flowy detail at the hem makes it unique. it's a basic without being basic. i'm so glad i added it to my wardrobe.
other I like this tunic. it is quite long and print in blue looks good with the butterflies. it feels very hot though! maybe better for winter. the sleeves are linen, i usually don't like linen much, it feels scratchy. this top works better in colder weather due to the sleeves and length of top. more like a tunic. i recommend it but am sending it back because i need something for summer.
other I love this sports bra. i do various exercises and it works great for all of them from yoga to running. the floral pattern is what really drew me to get this, but the quality of this bra is the best i've ever gotten. i wear a 34b bra and the medium fits perfect!!
other I passed up this dress so many times in the store and finally tried it on today because i wanted a casual dress while traveling in the cape. i was surprised how much cuter it is on than on hanger. i sized down to get a more fitting look and really made a difference for me in style. i was not a fan of the way it looked so loose on model. it looks really cute fitted and a bit sexy even. it is lined and very comfy and can be dressed up a but for work with a cardi. i believe i will get a lot of wear
3 Would have loved this skirt, but the xl is closer to a size 1other than a 1other or 16. larger ladies beware!
3 I love the style of this top. i just wish there were a slimmer version of it. unfortunately, this top doesn't suit my long, slim midsection. it is so wide, it completely hides the waist. i think it would look adorable on a different body type.
other Very cute dress for special occasions or even work. dress is comfortable, excellent quality but does run slightly large.
other I tried this shirt in a small (my usual retailer size) and it was very unflattering.   the fabric was ultra soft and it seemed it was nicely made.  however, this shirt is so unstructured and oversized, i might as well worn a brown paper bag.
other All the rave reviews are true!  this vest is plush and funky and i love wearing it. i'm having fun figuring out different outfits to wear with this. this is a great three season layering piece and i'm thrilled i was able to get it on sale.  my only regret was the lack of a petite selection.
other Got this on a whim and boy i'm very pleased! it's flattering and the material is perfect for spring weather. size up as mentioned by other reviewers.
other This cover up has great potential. i love the embroidery. the colors and design are great. however, it has a number of loose strings. it makes me wonder what might happen when i wash it. the fabric is on the thinner side, but it is not see through. the fabric would be nice for a hot day by the pool. i caught it on sale, so i am keeping it.
other These are so comfortable! i love how they fit snug but have tons of stretch..this is my second pair of fleetwood from coh. love this style
other After the second wash, the stitching in the armpits completely fell apart. after sewing it back up, wearing it, and washing it a third time, the stitching in the other armpit completely fell apart as well. not sure if this was just a fluke, but it was very disappointing. now that both armpits are sewn and all other stitches are intact, i must say that this is a great dress. i would have returned the dress to retailer, but i've already washed and worn it, so again...very disappointing. i would say
other Great leggings! they're well made and comfortable to wear. my only complaint is that they seem to be stretching just a little and don't fit perfectly.
other Great shirt that is basic with a little something extra. meadow rue does it again...i swear i buy everything they put out...
3 Very well made, wonderful fabric. fit perfectly everywhere but the bust.
other Had to have these when i saw them online. usually an ag girl, but loved the button fly and boyfriend fit. originally ordered a 28 and returned for a 27. after a couple of wears, wish i bought the 26. a must have!
other I bought these shorts in my usual size small (4-6) 38" around hips/butt. they are a little loose in the butt and hips but i like them that way, especially given the drapey fabric they're made out of. the print is gorgeous, especially at the waistband. you need a cropped top or you need to tuck in your shirt to show it off. the red is a true bright red but beautiful. the waistband has a functional drawstring. i suspect they will need careful washing and line drying. i would not put these in a dry
other Love the pattern of this tunic. it's comfy and unique.
other Such a cute dress, i ordered the black version. i'm large busted (dd) and the slip thankfully fit (sometimes it doesn't). i'm 5' 4" and went ahead with the regular, not petite, version and i have to say i think the petite would have been too short. the dress comes to the top of my knees as photographed on the model. highly recommend.
other I can't say enough good things about this romper. i am curvey on the bottom and have never been able to get on board with the romper trend because all the ones i had tried were too short or were clearly made for models and teenagers. this romper is a great length and style for all ages and body types. the material is so soft and is the kind of material that won't easily wrinkle. it can easily be dressed up for a night out with wedges and jewelry or dressed down for day with  flats (and maybe eve
other Gave this sweater to my mom this christmas and she has hardly taken it off...so cozy and cute!
other Great quality- this sweater runs small and not as long as pictured in the catalogue. it's perfect over a longer undergarment underneath or over a sleeveless dress. i love the color & quality. i ordered on line & decided to keep it, yet wear it differently than i originally thought.
other I was surprised at how soft this sweater is. i thought for a brief moment it was cashmere. i'm a little worried it might pill. we shall see!it is a pretty and classy sweater. will look great with jeans and heels or boots.it looks somewhat long on the model. it wasn't quite as long on me, which was a bit disappointing. i'm 5'7 with long torso (not abnormally long!). it's still a great sweater and will be great for upcoming holidays parties!
other Looks nearly exactly like the picture. will be very comfortable to wear. i ordered a petite large and could really have worn a medium. it's big all over. i figure i'll do a little tailoring on this come spring and adjust the fit. on the whole, happy.
other Just picked up this cardigan in the heather charcoal - so i can wear it in the fall and winter. the design on the border is well done and will show off whatever you wear under this cardi. sleeves are snug and long, but can easily be pushed up to 3/other length.
other What a great find! this is so easy to dress up or down and a very comfortable fit and fabric. the skirt fabric is pretty form fitting so not something i can comfortably wear to work but it's a versatile piece otherwise. the buttons on the sleeve are a nice touch.
other This is a great staple for laid back weekend wardrobe. the inside of the pullover is soft, like sweatshirt material, and its comfortable enough to sleep in. also cute enough to wear out with jeans. i would definitely recommend this sweatshirt. i'm typically a size 0 in retailer - i ordered this shirt in a size other and i love the fit.
other The tops looks fitted on the model because she pressed her arms against the clothes. to my surprise,the tops actually is very very very r o o m y below the chest area.the appliques/laces on the front are made of low quality materials.
other I bought the black and gray fleece lined leggings. i thought the price was great. too good to be true. you get what you pay for. once i opened the box they smelled awful. it was a chemical smell. i washed the black pair twice and it was a little better. i have washed the gray other times and it still smells.
3 I thought this top was so pretty and airy, but it just didn't work out. i typically wear an xl in retailer and was able to size down to a l in this top. i ended up returning because the front is pretty sheer and the black tented out in a weird way about half-way down (there is a seam across and without this it would have hung perfectly). disappointed.
other It actually is a pretty good t-shirt, but i wish that i had known that "white" actually means oatmeal with bits of grey and beige. i bought three and will now need to return them all. hopefully i can find it in other colors i like.
other I love this style of tank top with the wider straps. very flattering but yes the armholes are big and i noticed the sizing is different with each color. i normally wear an xs but in the gray and blue i bought s to have a little room. i also bought the black color but the s was huge! i exchanged for an xs so hopefully it will fit better. it had to be ordered. it definitely stretches out as you wear it though.
3 This was a fail for me. although i ordered size large it barely fit my midsection when tied and was too small in the waist. the fabric is nice though. best on thinner frames than mine.
other Lovely material and the white is like a milky white which i love. it hangs beautifully, irons well and fits great. i am 5'-6, an a cup, 150 lbs and ordered the small. i've already received a lot of compliments on it.
other Very comfy and really nice fabric. can see myself wearing these a lot. i'm a size 1other and the fit was perfect.
3 This vest was of excellent weight but it had very little style. it was like a giant piece of felt was cut out with little thought to design or nuance. not for me.
other The back of the shirt has a tag stitched in with red thread that goes through to the outside of the shirt. it is very visible and looks terrible - especially since the back is the focal point of the shirt. do not recommend
3 A little boxy but will be a go to basic. the off set ruffle gives interest
other I was excited to see this sweater in my local store. i have been coveting it online. it was just as pretty in person as i hoped it would be. the color is vivid and beautiful. i loved the buttons down the back. i usually wear a size small but they only had an extra small. i tried it on and liked the way it fit. i wanted a snugger look. i think the small would have worked too, just a looser feel.the fabric is very soft. now just waiting for cooler weather so i can wear it.
other Ordered this in my usual medium, knowing it was meant to be over-sized. but i could easily have put another of me (138 lbs. with junk in the trunk) inside it! so i'm returning it for a small, feeling sure that there'll still be enough extra for a slouchy look.
other And the bottom looks like a tutu. first, i have high tolerance for scratchy fabric but this one i could feel it even through long sleeves. there is no way i could wear something that makes my skin itch so badly. second, the peplum part is huge and looks like an exaggerated skirt. finally, the color on the "green one" is darker than in the picture and it does have more of a green than blue tint. back it goes.
other I am pleased with this skirt. the jean material is of good quality and it hangs right on my waist and hips. i ordered a other which left a little room in the waist to tuck in a blouse. i am 5/other and 119. it works well for work and leisure.
other The fabric of this dress is absolutely gorgeous from the design to the colors. i usually wear a size large in most retailer clothing, but i ordered this is l and xl because these dresses tend to disappear fast in the larger sizes. i ended up keeping the xl cause the buttons pulled across the chest on the l. this dress has a slim cut, and i would say if you have a small bust and are slender, this runs true to size. if you have a larger chest, size up because this is the type of dress you want to fl
other In retailer dresses the petites usually fit me better, i'm short, but this regular fit well. looks super cute, i've gotten so many compliments on it. comfortable, and the pockets are always nice.
other I love the pilcro line and these leggings (yes definitely more a legging than jean) did not disappoint. however, i did think the material would have a little more substance and weight.  they are pricey, so i am hoping that the thinness of the material will not prevent them from holding up well.
other Count me in as a five star lover of this dress! the details are so rich and interesting, so be prepared to get noticed when wearing. i'm happy to say that getting the size medium regular (instead of petite) was a good choice for my top heavy frame. the chest is fitted but not tight, the length is a not-too-short above knee, the tiered layers swing so nicely, and the beads/sequins add a touch is whimsy to the design. my one negative is the tassels at the neck tie--soo heavy cumbersome to style. o
other The fabric is really soft and the cardi has a cute and comfy slouchy, loose fit. reminds me of free people cardis with the extra long sleeves and loose fit. great to throw on over workout clothes or with jeans and a tee shirt. easy piece. would size down. i'm getting lots of use out of it.
other I absolutely love ag stevie ankle jeans and own them in three different colors. i'm on the shorter side, so in terms of length i'm able to wear them as regular jeans. the fabric is comfy and stretchy and the range of colors is great for wardrobe diversity and mixing and matching! this particular style is my absolute favorite. although ag jeans are on the pricier side, after i bought my first pair i was a convert. as opposed to other brands, i find that they are a worthwhile investment. as other
3 I was very excited to get this but very disappointed once it arrived. the fabric on the back is thin and clingy. i think you'd have to wear a slip underneath. cute design on the front but sadly it's going back.
other I waited a long time to get this top. unfortunately i will be returning. the sides are gathered and stick out a lot on the sides. not as pictured. the sides should have been pleated. it runs smaller in the bust and when closed it was a little snug. afraid this might shrink with dry cleaning or washing. the design is unique and wish this top would of worked.
other I bought this in red in xs (5'other 115lbs). it's really cute and flirty, but not in a little girl way, which some ruffle tops can look. the material is nice. a little over priced, but isn't everything from retailer?! the red is a perfect red imo, it's got an orange-y undertone to it, looks so good with white jeans and black sandals. if you're inbetween sizes, i would size down but otherwise pretty true to size. i wear everything in xs from retailer and the xs fits perfect.
other I usually try to avoid paying full price for items but saw this in the store and couldn't pass it up! tried it on in my usual size, 2p, and had to have it. i bought the white/black one, and it looks great with black capris. fabric is lightweight and airy; perfect for hot summer days.
other Ugh, the fit of this dress is terrible :/ what a beautiful dress though -- the material and the colors -- had so much potential. but, the fit is awful -- i ordered by regular size and the top was more or less ok, if not a tad big, but hip down was crazy tight that i couldn't even zip it without a ton of effort. i don't think sizing up will help because then the top will be even bigger. disappointing.
other I can't believe these aren't sold out yet.  i had no problem getting this over my head.  this top has such beautiful colors and embroidery.  quality is good.  flattering on.  at this price, it is probably the best deal i've gotten on anything from retailer.  i would recommend this top, absolutely!
3 There is nothing special about this skirt. it's plain and incredibly dowdy looking. long and wide. i am usually between a small and medium. after reading the other review that said the waist ran small i went with a medium. it fit fine in the waist/hips.
other Absolutely love this top, it falls perfect in all the right places. i've gotten so many compliments especially from the bow design on the back.
other I just bought this dress on the half off sale price which is practically a steal and i must say i absolutely adore it! it runs pretty tts but all they had available was one size up from my usual 6 so i bought the 8 and it fits just fine (34d-27-35). the color is beautiful and the look of the dress is very vintage 30's/40's and so cute. i didn't find the sleeves to stick out at all on me so maybe i just got lucky and the print is just adorable on this. i highly recommend!
3 I wrote item ran large, but that was true only in length. it would be long for someone 5'10" . however the bigger issue is getting it on. the style and quality are quite nice, but it does have some issues.
other Very pleased with the fabric and design of this. it is thick, but not heavy, and the cutouts in front fall so that you don't really have to wear anything underneath (there is one cut out pretty low in the middle that i didn't initially notice, but wasn't really a problem). i'm 5"4/b cup and i bought the small but would have been better with a medium as the small kinda pulled through the chest. i couldn't wear anything over it without it pulling the whole top up. it's also a bit shorter than i th
other I cannot say enough excellent things about these jeans...they fit beautifully, have just enough stretch and sit high enough on my waist to cover any unsightly rolls. this was my first pilcro purchase, and i will definitely be adding other styles to my closet in the near future. typically, i'm a size 3other or 1other in denim, but i sized down to a 3other in these after the sales associate made that suggestion. i'm so glad i did...they are a perfect fit!
other Love the pleating on this top. looks great with mywhite jeans. it's lightweight and has a slight sheerness.
other Love this dress! purchased it online, the xl sizes can be difficult to find in the store. dress is very cute on and you don't need to be reed thin like the model. it flatters the figure and yes, i wore spank with it. the length is good, the design (black and neutral) is flattering. i chose this to wear to my husband's christmas office party (his new job)! you know first impressions; i did not want to be over dressed. i wore my antho black boots which lace in back and go over the knee- (slouch a
3 I ordered this in black and white, thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles. i returned the black because it looked like polyester. the white is actually a cream/ivory, not bright white as pictured. it is also not the best feeling quality, however the fit is good, and true to size.
other I admittedly watched this dress until it went on sale, then was lucky enough to find it! i couldn't find my normal size (8p), so thought i would take a chance with the 10p and it fit perfectly! i haven't tried on the 8p, but i'm guessing it would have been a bit snug. the dress is comfortable and feminine, and i absolutely love it. i know i will wear it all summer!
other I wear an xxs petite and this dress was still large. i like that look so i'm okay with that but the sides do stick out a little bit if you have a smaller frame.
other This top is so pretty in person. it bells out at the bottom just the right amount.
other I have the t shirt from last year and i love it so could not wait to try the dress. why didn't you make it in petite? it can work with some tailoring but petite sizing esp since this runs on the big side, would have been ideal. love the navy, will try the white. how about some more colors and petite?? please??? more t shirt dresses in general too please!!
other Very elegant feel and look. love the side zip, sliming feature. great all around pant to dress up with heals or boots for work.
3 Unfortunately i had to size down twice with there pants. great feel, they're soft and the grey is a soft color.
other The shirt fits nice and has a classic cut. i would imagine this to look good on just about anyone. the shirt is soft and comfortable, but is rather thin and see through. the stitching is coming undone a little bit in some areas. wouldn't pay full price for it, but it's worth it on sale.
other I loved this dress online and was luckily able to locate it in a store about an hour away from me. i drove to the store to purchase it; however, when i tried it on, i was so disappointed! the print is adorable and it is made of great quality, but the swing style is definitely more than mini! i could have fit 3 of myself in this dress. it is definitely not as depicted in the photographs. also, the background of the dress is way more pink than appears in the photos, and the floral print isn't as r
other I bought this dress to use for maternity photos and it is perfect! i love the flow of the skirt and the elastic waistband worked perfect. i was able to fit in a size other (normally a size 0) so i hope to be able to wear it after pregnancy as well. i was worried about the bust area being too small, and while it's a tight fit for me currently it still worked.
other Bought this dress on sale - i haven't decided if i'm going to keep it yet or not, because i'm not sure if it's flattering to my bubble butt. i normally wear a 6-8 in retailer (5'6" 13other lbs thin limbs 38-26-38). i ordered this dress in a size other regular and i find the length perfect with flats or with heels. i also find the bust area, waist and hips accommodating without being tight, which usually never happens. for this current sale price, this is a gorgeous dress made with beautiful material.
other Love this dress and the color
other I purchased this dress in the red/orange color and was impressed by the quality of the fabric. the waist sat a bit higher on me that in does in the picture, so it looks much more like an empire waist on me.
other Nice quality, soft fabric, sleeves definitely make a unique statement. the fit worked for me, although it could have more room in hips (for my hourglass figure). got m, size l was way too big. i am 34d, but the dress can definitely accomodate bigger chest. the color are my favorites in this season.wear it to stand out!
other This is very cute. i got a lot of compliments when i wore it. i'm 5'10 so i always struggle with tops being too short but this was ok
other These are the perfect vintage-looking high rise jeans, without the risk inherent in buying vintage. for reference, i am 5'2", 108 lbs and usually a 26 in ag. these fit me perfect in a size 26 and were a great length for booties and flats. they fit me at versus above the ankle.
other Super soft and super chic! this sweater wrap looks great at the mall, at church, and even just curling up with a hot drink on a cold day at home. i'm still in love with this after a year!
other I tried this top on in-store in red and lavender. i love it! yes, it is big, but it is still really cute. if you are between sizes, go down a size. i am 5'5" 34b and went with an xs in the red. it appears to fit in the front but looks larger in the back, which i think the other reviewer was getting at.
other The skirt is beautiful, but the sizing is kind of off. i usually wear a 6, at 5'6" and 130 lbs. i ordered an 8, though, since sometimes athropologie clothes run small. even the 8 was too tight, so i'll have to exchange it.
other I love that retailerpolgie has petite sizes now. i am 5'4" and 115lbs. i bought the 0p and it fits perfectly. the dress is very cute and the colors are a way to transition into fall when its still warm out.
3 I love the way that this suit looked, however i found that it was lacking in support. i was disappointed to discover upon trying it on, that it just does not cover my butt. it fit elsewhere just fine, but the slim cut up the sides left it a little too revealing for my liking. in addition i found the top to be awkwardly fitting around the chest area. i am a 34b and ordered a small and it seemed to be too baggy at the top.
other This is cuter in person than online. the scarf goes all the way around the neck and ties on the side as the halter. the whole top is soft like a t-shirt material. there is an elastic band at the bottom, but it's not too cinched so it won't cut into your waist- it just gives it a little bit of shape. it's a cute way to show off some shoulder this summer in a lightweight fabric. i'm looking forward to wearing it out at night with nice jeans or during the day outside. a good price for retailer
other I really wanted to love this dress. i bought it for a photoshoot that will be outdoors, and thought that the green color would be perfect. it is well made, but the fabric is lighter than expected. the biggest issues was the size. i am 5'7" and typically a size ten. i ordered the ten and it fit like a 14-16. it was huge. if you order this, i would say size down two sizes.
3 I'm a pretty solid 10 these days (and had no trouble fitting into other size 10 dresses at the store). the large was so tight around my hips. i barely got it on. they didn't have an xl to try on, but i can't imagine i would have fit in it. so, if you have wide hips, this is not the dress for you. it fit fine on top in the l, it was just so tight in the hips that it did not lay nicely.
other The lighter tinted denim is a faded blue-grey that will go perfectly with most of my wardrobe, and is more summery than the usual dark denim i wear. these feel like stretchy jeans to me, not leggings. i wear size 28 in most jeans and these fit tts. really nice.
other Ordered the shirt online. beautiful print and good quality material. runs very large - size down other may be other sizes as the material on the body is very wide. i will be exchanging it in the store.
other This is a nice basic solid top with the extra appeal of textured detail around the shoulders and back. the v-neck is flattering. this top can work with many different outfits. i only wish my store carried the petite length, as the regular was too long for me.
other The title says it all....this fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design. the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials (shoulder is a knit, sweater-like navy fabric) is interesting. however, that is where the positive comments end on this one. the top is so scratchy,, stiff, and, frankly, uncomfortable. i cannot imagine wanting to wear it. it could benefit from a lining, and that might have solved the problem of scratchy, itchy fabric.the stiff fabric of the bo
other I ordered:xspxxsxxspxxsp was the better fit, some people loved it some didn't like as much (thought it was baggy and are not used to seeing me in baggy clothing. but that being said, ti was comfortable, the cutouts fell right on spot on my shoulders, and it is a nice casual embellished look half tucked in some boyfriend jeans. i reordered mine as it had something stuck on it and it bothered me (like sticky white) i will re-evaluate when i get the new order only because there are sooo m
other Beautiful dress. when you look at it on the hanger you think this could be really good or really bad. but it is absolutely beautiful. would highly recommend it - can dress it up or down.
other This top could've been one of my favorites ever. i ordered the rose option and was planning on ordering another color. the fabric is super thin but i was able to wear w/o an extra tank. unfortunately after other wears, several small holes appeared around the neck/under the ruffle. i washed this top on hand wash cycle and hung to dry. when i came to read the reviews, i noticed i wasn't the only customer with this issue.
other I love this dress?sophisticated and amazing?fabulous fabric. however, if you are petite and take a 0, it will be enormous! i am trying to decide if i send it back or have it altered.
other This is great without a belt, with or without leggings. it drapes just right and is flattering for big busted, big behind women (like me).
other I've been looking for a dress to wear to wedding this summer, and this is it. the blue color is lovely and the lace overlay is feminine and pretty. i'm small busted (34aa) with an athletic lower body (think, 120-lb marathoner), and the flare of this dress is perfect. i ordered this in a 0 and a 0 petite. the petite size looked little-girl short; the regular size hit just at my knee and was much more sophisticated. the waistband also fell at a more flattering place in the regular dress. i'm on th
3 Ordered it because i am fan of floral dresses.i found that colors are not as bright as pictured, overall color looks beige in real life. fabric has nice weight, not too heavy nor too light, it is not itchy, but not very soft either. good dress for colder weather. the sizing was right, i got my usual m and i am 5'10'' 145lb. the dress has a side zipper, but i did not need it. the dress is slimming and close to the body. the cut did not work for me: sleeves were too short, i had to pull them up t
other I am 5'other and 120 lbs and ordered a size 0. the dress fit perfectly in the shoulders and arms and below the waist, but i could barely fit my 32a size chest in the dress! the other reviewers are not kidding about the chest area being very narrow. i have had to order a size other instead. we'll see if that works.
other Love this shirt with leggings. if you are in between sizes- size down
other This one totally worked for me. love the color, length, and style.
other This dress is so flattering, i had wanted to try it on for awhile. when it hit sale w/ additional % off i headed to my local store. the dress fits like a dream, so darn cute for summer, in cali we have a lot of summer left. this dress pairs perfectly with the gretta espadrilles. my usual size small was perfect. hurry and get this perfect dress before it sells out!
other This is what a bathing suit should look and feel like. no crawling up the cheeks :) no spillage out the front. i would say it's true to size or a little on the large size. i'm 5'other 12other and ordered a medium which was great for me. maybe a small would have been ok but i couldn't be happier. good job! color is true to the pic. quality seems nice and sturdy.
other I ordered a 6 and it fit great i am 5ft 3" and 130lbs 34b in the chest! i love the fabric, i was drawn to it because i don't think it will wrinkle and crease as easily as other fabrics. it is a flattering cut and is very beautiful in person. the embroidery makes the dress unique.
other Beautiful fabric, great quality, fits true to size. love them!
other I was expecting a lot more, but this was disappointing. the material is thin and the quality isn't great. it also hung loose, just too loose, as it runs very very large i returned it
other I absolutely love this sweater. it will take me into spring and right on in to summer beach bonfire nights. a great staple!
other Very flattering. fits tts. love the colors. does not give any lift up or support to breasts.i am a 36 c and i was fine with this. it is so flattering to back and overall a flattering fit i was ok with my breast not being supported and uplifted. if you want support this is not for you. it does look exactly as it does on model in regard to coverage showing some cleavage but very little. i am 5'6" 127 lbs and not very fit and took a medium. my husband really loves this suit and gave it two big thum
other I eyed this for so long hoping it would go on sale. i finally bought it during the 20% off retailer members day. sized up from my usual size other to avoid the buttons on the bust looking like they were about to burst free. the rest still fits way. i absolutely cannot wait for the next rainy day to wear this!
other I on the other hand wore these once and boy did they stretch during the day! i really hope they shrink back up...
other I got so many compliments on this the first day i wore it. i think of this more like a sweater coat than a regular sweater. it is extremely soft and warm, but not bulky at all. it lays really neatly, which is why i think of it more like a coat. this will definitely be a staple moving into the winter and then into spring. keep in mind though that this does not button - they're just for show.
other These are amazing! wide slits on out seam show off your cute shoes! runs large! i'm 5'7", 140, size 6, hourglass. small was quite loose at waist. xs fits my actual waist and makes length right for flatter shoe <3" heel. or small petite sits on my hips and makes length right for flatter shoe. both fit. there is ease through entire pant leg. beyond comfortable! doesn't wrinkle. looks great with the roll-neck sweater in ivory and a silver wedge shoe!
other Based on the other reviews, i sized down from my usual 6p to a 2p, but this dress was still ridiculously huge and extremely unflattering. i could tell the minute i took it out of the package it wouldn't work. i can't imagine this would flatter very many people. the front photo of the model is incredibly deceptive. very disappointed--this will be going back for sure.
other Very intricate detail with stitching. love the contrast of black on cream. has slits on each side. bought it for holiday parties! just what i had hoped it would be.
other The skirt has a great cute design and great colors and great shape. but it runs very small and short. this company needs to provide a better fit, and large sizes if they run small.
other I can't get enough of this dress! this dress is everything. from the flattering fit, to the colors and pattern, to the design, and to the quality.. this dress really has it all. this is worth every penny and in my opinion, a great price for a versatile, high quality dress. the material is that super comfy, stretchy material which is perfect for everyday! it is a no brainer and easy to throw on. i'm so happy it comes in petite as the xsp length fits me perfect! it hits at the perfect length for a
other I have a tough time shopping for jeans because almost everything that fits my butt is too big in the waist. also, i have thick thighs so that's an issue and i hate shopping for jeans. these are so much cuter on than on the hanger. try them. you won't regret it. so flattering.
other It's like a work of art, but sadly, not flattering on me. i absolutely loved the look, and even considered taking it to a tailor, but the material overall is very stiff. if you're teeny tiny and need something to give you the illusion of hips, you might love it. very sad to return this.
other Buy this robe before its gone! my friend and i each bought this robe... it feels amazing and makes a girl feel pretty!. i bought the xs/s (34c, 26" waist), but i tried on the m/l and could have made that work too. love!
other The jacket runs large so size down. it's a good jacket to throw on the go. but i don't see this lasting long bc after he first wash, it started piling. the quality of the material isn't great!
other I actually ended up buying two of these dresses. i took the first one to the dry cleaner and they chewed up the slip and put a hole in the dress. i was so sad that i went and bought a second one before they could sell out. the good news is that it was on sale! this is an awesome light and airy dress that is great for those hot summer days. i pretty much wear it every opportunity i get. for reference i purchased the small. it's loose but the shoulders, armholes and slip all fit perfectly. i weigh
other I have had a problem finding jeans that fit properly (that i don't have to pull up every single time i walk up the stairs or stand up) but these are perfect. they are made with a bit of a stretchy material, yet keep their shape well. i am 5'7, 130 pounds, athletic body type and got a size 25. the only thing i am worried about is the dark color bleeding onto a light colored couch/quilt/purse/etc. as this has happened to me before with dark wash jeans.
other This is a very nice, flattering thing which can be worn as a dress or a shirt. therefore decided tiokeep it.
other I noticed some reviewers didn't like the loose shape of the dress. it is indeed a dress with a looser silhouette than most! but that's what makes it unique and expensive looking! i loved the extra material in the dress, especially in the back, it flowed gracefully and beautifully. i can imagine wearing this dress for many occasions and feeling instantly chic with minimal effort! :) it was also very figure flattering! i ordered the size l and it was a perfect knee length, so i would say this dres
3 I wore this coat one day and the buttons started falling off. it stretched so much. i'm going to beg my local store to take back. it shouldn't fall apart like that. it's super duper cozy though.
other This jacket is pretty cute in person. it is a nice thick gauzy material. the black is more like a dark washed gray color. while i do like the jacket, i feel like it is cut a little wide... maybe i should have ordered a size down. i usually wear a combination of 6s and 8s and am usually between a small and medium. i ordered this in a medium, but there was quite a bit of extra fabric at the sides and in the shoulder area. i'm returning the jacket for now, but might reorder in a small another time.
other This dress is adorable. the material is thin and wrinkles easily but it is so flattering. the cut is a little flowy like typical off-the-shoulder dresses but this one is cut in at the waist so your figure is not swallowed up. it combines the sexy summer vibe of an off-the-shoulder look but flatters like a fit and flare dress. it is fairly short. while i am only 5'4" in an xs it falls just a bit further up on my legs than the model pictured (makes no sense to me). the color is a rich coral pink a
other Saw this online and ran over to the store to try it on. so lovely! i thought i would want it in the cream color but the blue was so lovely in person. it's like a muted blue that makes it so versatile. the detail in the back is gorgeous and so flattering. the safety pin is such a unique touch. it's nice and warm, just not super soft, but not scratchy. i do think i will be extra careful with it because it seems like it could get caught on things easily.
other I was so excited that retailer finally had some bermuda shorts for those of us that are 1) older and don't want to show off that much leg anymore, and 2) are "curvy on the bottom" and really cannot wear the shorter shorts. i ordered these immediately in the navy. i usually wear a 3other in pilcro jeans, and like the other reviewer observed as well, i was floating in these - not only in the waist but everywhere. the legs are big - but it's supposed to be a boyfriend cut so i get that, but they just are
other I purchased this in other colors. the black which is really actually a dark grey( no complaints) and the cream with black print version. i have worn both at least once a week and receive compliments everytime! looks great with skinny pants or jeans. great alone or layered with a jacket or cardigan. does run on the looser side fyi
other I adore this top! the tencel fabric feels like a nicely worn out denim shirt that's been worn for years. it is a versatile piece that can be worn year round.  even if the sleeves are pulled onto the shoulders,  it still works and looks just fine. i'm broad in the shoulders, and we'll endowed,  but the large was perfect.
3 This is a beautiful looking dress, but definitely runs wide and long. i'm 5'4, 112llbs and my normal xs swallowed me up. if it had been available in xs petite then that probably would have worked, even though i normally never go with petites. it is a gorgeous dress, and would probably work on those ladies who are taller.
other Love this top! the fit is so comfortable, and it flows beautifully when you walk. the added bonus is the flirty open back, cross strap design to make even your exit an attention grabber. pairs great with some jean leggings and wedge heels. loved it so much i went back and ordered another color.
other I love this thing. i bought it yesterday and already am wearing it today, and i have been known to leave things sitting around in my closet for awhile before i wear them, especially if they aren't a sure thing. for reference, i am a curvy, busty size 14. i bought an xl but a l would have worked too. it has a drawstring on the inside back and on the bottom center back hem, so it can be adjusted for more shape through the waist. it has a beautiful drape, is very soft, and the embroidery makes it s
other Similar to others here, these pants were ruined after one wash. the first pair i bought simply faded after one wash, which was okay, but the second pair got weird splotches on the backside. i'd rather not call attention to that particular area of my body;) could've been a great addition to my wardrobe if they were better quality.
other It's a nice drop-waist, embroidered, lightweight dress for summer. my problem was that the armholes were too large for me and i found that to be unflattering. it's a swing style so it's forgiving in the hips and belly.
other I like the color and design of the pullover sweater, so i bought it as a christmas gift for myself. it arrives almost the same as the picture. the only complain i have is that the size is a little larger than i expected. however it still look good on me,
other This is one of the best purchases fi have made at retailer recently. i got this in ivory in my usual xs. the pictures do not do it justice.  it has such a nice drape and i love the detail on the back.  looks great with black cropped trousers, as well as skinny jeans.
other Long enough to wear without leggings but also great with them. i also purchase the belt pictured and it looks as good in person as it does in the photo!
other This top is so beautiful!  really well made with solid embroidery - not the thin lightweight type.  i thought it ran rather large but i don't have the bust to fill in the top area.  i'm usually a small in tops (sometimes medium due to my height 5'8") but went down to an xs so the arm holes didn't show too much.  length was still great.  a steal at the sale price!
other This t-shirt does a great job of elevating the basic t-shirt in to one with a touch of flair. i typically wear a medium but luckily read earlier reviews and went with the small.
other The top is so soft, and the lace detail in the backs makes this your no-so-average chambray top. the fit is flattering for a curvy figure.
other I immediately purchased this dress when it came into store. at 5'7" it hits enough above the knee to be flirty, but still not too short and is appropriate for me to wear to work. sleeves are fitted which helps to balance the trapeze fit. i'm just concerned with keeping the lace in good condition, but overall i love the dress.
other I just bought the grey, and now i'm coming back for the black and cream i lovethis staple item!! so soft fits great!
other I have this tee in every single color and love it. this shirt is so soft, airy, and comfortable, and the ribbon embellishment on the back dresses it up a little. i love wearing leggings or skinny jeans with it and accessorizing with an infinity scarf. i normally wear a size small, but i sized up to a medium this time. there is very little difference in the two sizes, but i liked the modest increase in length. i'm glad that i did this, because the tees shrunk ever so slightly after being in the d
other Love this shirt! i love florals so the bright pretty yellow just had to be mine. it is true to size, perfect neckline- not too low or high and very flattering. see through enough to require a cami, but worth it. very soft fabric and really comfy.
other This tunic looks awesome in the picture. however, it is made of an uncomfortable sweater-like material not left of centers normal skin cotton. i was disappointed once i saw this in person. not a great material for summer.
other I tried this cute black dress on in the store and even in the xs it was a little too big. i'm 5'3", so if they had petites available in the store maybe they would have fit better. just found too much material around the middle even though it is meant to be a loose fitting dress. the material is heavy weight, very stretchy, but not a thick fabric. could be great in the summer.
other I purchased these pants on-line in my usual size petite other and they were a perfect fit for me. i have a 27" waist, 35" hips and i'm 5'4" and found them to be a little long but not so much that i want to hem them as i'll be wearing these with my clogs and platforms anyway. if i want to be able to wear them with flats, i'll need to hem them but i bought them to go with my higher shoes so it's no bother. these are very slimming pants and zip up at the back. they are a tad difficult to zip up but not
other This is theoretically a great summer top addition to your wardrobe. i love the floral print - it's bold and lively primary colors on a black background. i'm usually a size small in retailer tops and neither the small nor the medium fit me very well. the small was a bit too fitted everywhere and strangely, the medium gapes at the front when i'm sitting but not standing (i'm 34b otherwise height-weight proportionate with broad shoulders). another reviewer mentioned a design flaw - the floral print i
other Too much material everywhere. i am 122lbs 5'4" and i ordered an xs as usual. i was overwhelmed in a blanket of knitted material of muted colors. nice green slip, though. i will return it asap. this is super-ugly.
other I got the white with black print and it is nice material and a pretty dress. i just would have preferred a better cut but overall pretty work dress .
other I am normally an xs or s in tanks, so ordered the size 6. looks pretty much on me as in the pic. love that it's a cotton denim but it doesn't have any stretch. love the look & the fabric, but the neck area feels slightly restrictive in the front & i think it wld creep up & pull on me when wearing. fabric is slightly stiff & the flared bottom just sticks out. armholes do cover the bra & length hits at the top of the hips on me. going to return the 6, but will try the 8 if the local store has it.
other I can see why the other reviewers think this top is huge in the waste - it's wide and not tailored at the waste ! the key to super cute fit is to size down - then it will look like it does on the model in the picture. i went with my regular medium and felt like i was wearing a giant moomoo, so i sized down and it immediately looked like it does on the model in the picture. it's super adorable in person, the collar and the polka dots make this playful yet very dressy and feminine and appropriate
other I was a little hesitant to buy these given that i am just 5'1" - i didn't want to look like an extra from the set of "newsies." but these are very well made and tailored for a woman's body...the trousers actually accentuate the waist and the cropped leg works well for a petite frame. they are nicely lined and the wool blend is soft and not scratchy. i love them!
other First problem-i would not have ordered this at all had the description been correct. the fabric description is cotton which the dress is most certainly not. secondly, it has a really funky, cheap, unfinished, raw-hemmed slip which is simply not fitting for the dress. the keyhole in the front is super long-again, does not seem to fit the dress. i am not happy with this piece at all but it did fit tts. length is just above knee. i am 5'5" 14other lbs 34d and the six was a good fit. sending this home t
3 Loved that this was an 100% boiled wool dress but unfortunately runs very large. i tried the small and extra small - both were really large in the hips. i will maybe try the xxs - was hoping to make this is winter staple.
other Love this tank! so easy to throw on quickly and still look out together!
other This dress is quite the stunner! i love the mix of patterns and the asymmetrical hem. four stars in quality, though, as it could have a bit of pure cotton in the fabric composition, as opposed to rayon + viscose only. still, a versatile dress, for day or night. i love the length of the petite size (please note i'm 5' 4") the shortest part of the hem hits right at the knees. a keeper.
3 Loved the bright pattern online and had hoped it had a similar fit to the tyla ts which i love. in actuality this was a lot boxier. the cut was shorter in length, too short for my 5'10 frame. the width was rather boxy and unflattering, particularly with the wide arm holes and flat cuffed sleeves. also the pattern looked a little cheap in person, way less spectacular than retailers typical gorgeous vibrant patterns. this is going back i'm afraid.
other This dress is a keeper. fits true to size, comfortable and love the pockets. it can be a casual day dress or add some jewelry for a night time dinner out. i was concerned with the fabric being a velvet material but is very light and comfortable
other Beautiful dusty rose color! the fit is fabulous! love the sleeve and hem length! very flattering and does not cling.
other Wanted a jumpsuit that didn't look stupid on a 50+ year old -- this is it! ordered a large and it is a little loose around the waist, but still fits and is comfortable. extremely well made and very cute. the only complaint is that it is difficult to tie the back.
3 Like the other reviewers i was disappointed to receive the gray dotted sweatshirt with a zipper down the center when it was not in the model picture. looks like this item has since been removed from this listing...would have been nice to have the correct item pictured in the first place.
other I wish i had read the other review about the color of the pink version of this sweater before i ordered it. she was absolutely right - the color is completely different in person. it is this garish pink and brown that looks like it was knit together with remaindered yarn. it's too bad, because the cut of the sweater is cute and the zipper adds a funky touch. maybe the blue is better in person...
other I was hesitant to try this top on because i thought it might be too tight, and then was delighted to find that it is so comfortable and flattering. i am usually a m and the m fit me great. i have to disagree with another reviewer that this top is for those of us b cup or smaller. i am a d and it fit me great. it's got enough give and support (great fabric and wrap design) to fit a wide range of bust lines. it's a great blend of being attractive without being too revealing. i love it. got it in b
other I was a huge fan of these lovely swing dresses from last year and bought all 3 colors. when i saw this new one, i was thrilled and ordered it immediately. what a disappointment! why did isabella sinclair mess with a good thing? the fabric is a very loose weave sort of "homespun" look, which wouldn't be a deal breaker, but i could see it would be very vulnerable to snags. last year's styles had a removable light knit full slip that allowed the airy fabrics to move. this version is fully lined. yo
other I love this dress. i get so many compliments from strangers every time i where it. must buy.
other I am going on a trip to south africa in may and needed pants that were cute, durable, yet comfortable and not frumpy. these are definitely the ones i was looking for. the fit is great - not too tight and not too baggy. i got them in three colors and all of them match what is on the site. i definitely recommend these chinos as you will be able to wear them to lots of different places - dressed up or down.
other This sweater is very long, could be worn as a dress at 5'3 !
other I bought this to wear with a skirt that i wanted to dress down - i needed something that was long enough to be able to tuck it in without having that awkward line. its a great fit.
other This dress is exactly what i was looking for. i have a very business casual job but wearing jeans and blouses can get boring so i'm constantly on the lookout for easy, go-to dresses that i can throw on year round with flats, booties, sandals, etc. this dress is exactly what i had in mind and i look forward to wearing it in the fall/spring with booties and in the winter with tights.
3 I have been searching for grey jeans and haven?t found anything that i truly love. i tried on both a 25p and 26p. the 25p was too tight and i don?t think they would have stretched out enough for me to be comfortable in. the 26p was close but i was afraid they would stretch out too much. they looked good from the front but did nothing for my cushion. the color, length and feel of the jeans was perfect. in the end they went back and the hunt continues for grey jeans. i would recommend trying these
other I most often fit into a size medium. based on prior reviews, i ordered this dress in a small and it fits perfectly. it drapes nicely. the fabric is soft and flows well. the under layer has a nice little stretch to it. the dress looks good with and without the belt. my favorite and most-slimming look is to just tie cinch and tie it in the back, such that it does not wrap around the front at all. the dress is so comfortable and the neckline is very flattering. no bra needed for my small bust.
3 This is a super cute tunic - it is simply way too big.
other I was looking for a really warm, but stylish coat that i could wear when the weather is frigid as it sometimes gets here in the dc area. i tried on a size small, which is my usual coat size. while the coat fit, it was not flattering. for reference i am 5'9" 128 pounds and usually wear a small/xsmall in retailer tops. in this coat i looked like a linebacker with pads on. the front material is doubled, which makes you look like you have a large protruding stomach. the shoulders are bulky and
other I'm always on the search for a comfortable shirt with style. this does not disappoint. super comfy and flattering. love.
other Absolutely lovely dress, in a gorgeous color, drapes well. the perfect blend of pretty and sexy. so much more beautiful in person!
other I purchased this sweater since the design immediately caught my eye. i love it. i am 5-03 fit and trim, but chose a large/regular to accommodate my shoulders and chest. the fit is close but i do not look "poured" into it. i do have a long back-waist length--not a true petite. the wool is soft, substantial; but not bulky. sleeve length is flattering. i plan to wear this sweater to the office on casual fridays with well-fitted dark-wash jeans--an appropriate look for anyone, not withstanding an ad
other What is going on with maeve sizing this season? in the past two months, i've purchased two maeve dresses that run very small--particularly at the waist.  having many maeve items from past seasons and other recent retailer purchases, it's impossible to ignore that maeve's sizing is quite off. that aside, the vibrant summer colors and material quality are great. the skirt is lined but billowy and fuller than ideal. strangely, it's a lot of dress yet not enough at the same time. there bodice h
other While i thought it looked really pretty on the hanger, when i tried it on it just felt like a mess. perhaps it suits other personalities and bodies. i hated that the zipper was in the front; i personally find it tacky and gawdy. while the patterns are pretty, the material felt like some weird fabric wallpaper and i didn't see how the price was justified with how the material felt cheap to me.
other Great feeling trench. can dress it up or down.just be prepared to take a steamer with you. it comes wrinkled and will wrinkle very easy.
other A finely laced sheer bustier along with a gown split along the sides makes for a lovely sleeping garment. the material is cooling and the lace is not itchy.
other Looking for the perfect camisole that smooths the flab, keeps you warm or cool as appropriate, doesn't ride up, and looks good? this is it! it takes a bit of extra effort to get this cami over your head and pulled down, but once you do, you say "ahhh!" it feels good and is a blessing--a seamless bit of control of middle-age, middle-body flab. for sizing: i wear a size other in most clothes, and in this cami, i can wear a small/medium or a medium/large. the former pulls in more, but the later gives m
other I was very happy to snag this dress at such a great price! it's very easy to slip on and has a very flattering cut and color combo.
other I am so glad that i ordered this top. it is kind of shimmering and looks so pretty in person! it is nicely lined and i love the sweetheart shape at the front. i am 5'2", 34b, broad shoulder, ordered size s and m, and they both fit quite nicely. the size s is more like a trailered fit on me, while the size m gives more room for my arms and shoulder, also extra length that i can tuck it in my low-raise demin. i ended up keeping size m since i like my tops to fit a bit more flowy. i can see myself
other This shirt is so very pretty in person. the detail on the neckline and the lace up on the back are so cute and give the shirt just a bit of whimsy, making it more unique than your usual flowy t-shirt. it lays perfectly and the material is very soft and comfy. you can wear it casual or dress it up. i may get another one because this is the kind of shirt i will wear constantly!
other I love this tank top. i was looking for a mockneck tank for a while, and this totally fit the bill. i wear it to work and out, and feel great in it.
other This top has a beautiful pattern, and the color is gorgeous - just like the photo. it is very thin, but under a sweater or blazer in the fall/winter would be perfect. it is a little big! i would order a size down.
other I love this dress, but i am 5'7" and a size 12, so am a bit curvy. this dress was great on the bottom, but the way that he did the top of it made me look even more busty than i am. i returned it for that reason. however, if he would make that "skirt" as a stand alone, i would buy in a second.
other Cute top, good color, fabric is a little rough and scratchy
3 Beautiful and versatile dress but shoddy quality. i hand washed (per the instructions) it after wearing it once  and the sleeves are already falling apart.
3 I have been eyeing this piece for months now! i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock. i am other 'other and 110 lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs. i think the top is too baggy for me. yes, the top and bottoms fit overall, but it doesn't look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model. it is very sheer--which is the thing that discourages me the most. i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work, which i am willing to work on s
other Purchased the daisy sleep top to go with the matching shorts. i had been eyeing them for awhile in the store and so glad i took the plunge to get the set. i feel feminine and sexy as another reviewer noted while not being revealing (helpful for visitors and children :). i purchased a s as it does run a bit large.
other I'm assuming the model showing the sweater is at least 5'9", it is slightly cropped on her , but it certainly doesn't look super cropped. i'm 5'4" and its super cropped on me. even with high waist jeans.also, it is incredibly itchy. i even tried it with a cami under but the itchy wool came right through the cami.too bad, its a cute design, just needs some tweaking.
other I love everything about this top. first, it's super flattering, especially if you have a tummy. i am small chested, and it makes me look a little chestier than i am. i tried on both the xs and s in the black (it's really a charcoal gray) but preferred the fit of the xs. note: i'm 5'8" / 136 lbs and typically wear an xs or s in most retailer tops. the small seemed too drapey and the armholes were a tad big. my store didn't have the wine color or i would have purchased it too.
other Love this top. bought it in both color ways. just adorable and washes well. great option for larger ladies. retailer needs to provide more xls to be available in the stores. i shop at the pasadena store and see so many women my size shopping right next to me, and there is nothing for us. it is so sad that we want to spend our money with you, but you don't want it.
other Love this dress - haven't worn it yet but wow the design / artwork of the fabric is beautiful !! waiting for weather to cool off a bit so can wear with my off white suede gogo boots ....
other This caftan is very light and well-made. i love the colors and designs on this fabric. i was worried that it might make me look boxy, but it accentuates my figure surprisingly well. the fabric is so soft!!! i'm amazed at the price because this is a really beautiful cover-up.
other Tried on & bought in-store. so cute & flattering; the picture doesn't do it justice. great neutral piece (more beige than ivory in person). looks cute tied or untied. i'm 5'3" and 120 lbs and the regular size s fit perfectly (not too snug, not too loose, and just long enough to cover my bum.)
other I do love sheath dresses and this one is very adorable!true to size and nice length.the black and white is kind of a throwback to the 60s flower power era and really cute.nice weight so feels substantial not the flimsy wrinkly type material; more like a crepe.very nice!
3 I wanted to love this dress... and i did until i turned around. the back seam didn't hang right. it pulled towards the knotted side, across my behind. i tried on two different xs that they has in store and both had the same issue. one of the dresses hung much looser, i had to recheck the tag because i didn't believe it was the same size! disappointing because it really is pretty and showcases curves nicely.
other I love the idea of this top, but wish there wasn't so much fabric. i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.
other I'm a 110 lb, shorty with a short torso and long arms so the standard xs was huge. i had the opportunity to try on both the xxs petite and xs petite. the xxs petite was almost perfect but i wanted it more flowy - probably best for those that are even shorter and more lightweight than me, othewise, it looks a little too boxy. the petite xs fit me the best and draped nicely, similar to the model in the pink. i had a sweater with this exact silhouette 5+ years ago and wore it to death even though i
other This shirt is perfect! bought charcoal and ivory. compliments galore, super cute with jeans, workout pants. love it!
other I love this top which gives you the look of a blouse but the ease of a t-shirt! the sky blue color is spectacular. the details of this top are beautiful and very flattering! i am tall at 5'8" and it was plenty long enough. i ordered my typical size s and it was perfect. it is cut to follow the lines of the body. i can't wait until the spring so i can wear it! it would be great if it was available in more colors.
other This dress was overall cute, but you have to have an olive/darker complexion or a nice tan to really pull it off because it is such a pale pink. i'm very fare, but normally can do light punks, but this one just clashed. it does run pretty true to size. if you're on the edge between a smaller or bigger size, i recommend the smaller size however. hope this helps y'all!
other I ordered these online. i usually wear a 4-6 depending on the brand. i ordered the 6 and love the way they fit as i didn't want them tight. they have a lot of stretch and the fabric is nice quality.
other I am 5'4", 14other pounds, 34dd and ended up with the size small for reference. it fit well but definitely roomy - in case you're not into that style. never tried the extra small, but i would prefer this dress not to hug onto me so i stayed with the small. this dress was really nice and comfy, soft material. the pockets are low and my phone stayed in while i walked but i wouldn't recommend anything heavier than a phone to go in the pockets. i wore this to a family and friends function and re
other Tried on standard xs and the photo on-line is slightly misleading as i thought that there were more colors involved in the embroidery pattern. in person, the pattern is not as intricate with only other solid colors. the body of the shirt is light, airy/billowy, not as form grazing like on the model..which i don't mind. i still love the top but would have to go for a petite xs or even a petite xxs so that it would be a little more fitted all around. note that the embroidery on the dã©colletã© feels lik
other This dress fits true to size and is great to wear around on a warm day. you can dress it up or down so there are many uses for it. this brand has always provided great quality too. i'm excited for warmer weather!
other This is a cute top, especially the material design. i like tops that go over my bottom and this does. if i had a problem it is with the sizing. the fact that it was only online so i could not try it on made it difficult to know really what size to get. some reviews said it was true to size and others said go down a size. i did go down a size but it still hangs a little big. but i still love the overall look. i am also petite which is what i ordered.
other I recommend zooming in on the fabric as there are like ink streaks on it which at first i thought was a flaw but it is clearly shown--and is actually a nice touch to make these different!  the fit is true to size or a tiny bit small if you are curvy in the hips.  i wear a 10-1other and the l is fine but i wouldn't want them any smaller.  super lightweight the piping detail on the sides is really cute!
other I received this top in my normal xxsp size and it fits perfect. it's roomy so i'm glad i went with the smallest size. the color states pink but it's really between a red and raspberry so it's better looking than pictured. as with most off the shoulder tops, if you raise your hands it slips up, but it actually looks good that way too and forms a square around the neck that appears like that's the natural design. overall, great value, light and flowy, plus the fabric is a soft linen so it breathes
other I was a bit worried when i took it out of the packaging but once i tried it on, all was well. it is a cute and comfortable outfit with enough detail to be stylish. i love rompers and this one is a great addition to the wardrobe.
other This is more of an undershirt than a shirt. the material is very very thin and it shows everything. it was beyond unflattering on me. don't buy this unless you have a knockout thin body.
other I just purchased this adorable, unique looking sweater at my local retailer store and absolutely love it. as soon as i saw it, i knew i had to have it! it is super soft, tts so i purchased it in my regular size small and it has the cutest pockets ever. the little black buttons also add to the look but the black snails on the pockets are what's really so sweet on this one. though i'm not a fan of snails in my garden, i'll make an exception for a couple of them making a guest appearance on this swea
3 This sweater runs true to size. i am 5'7' and 12other lbs and ordered the small. it has a beautiful mix of colors that reminds me of a creamsicle. it is a well made, heavy sweater that will definitely keep you warm. if you like the feel of wool, buy it. if not, pass on it.
other Bummed out.. this is super cheaply made and very expensive... the design is different , the color is beautiful, but the material is a different story.. it should be priced at the most 30 bucks.. not 128.. i'm returning them. also, they run very big..!
other Love this shirt. i have it in black.  i have a larger chest, but i don't feel like the seams hit me wrong.  this is super cute and swingy.  i however think the price is way too high for a think cotton tee.
other This top is very cute but runs large. i am a 32b and i had to take the xsmall. the back of the bathing suit only has one slot for closing it up so you can't adjust it.
other I do think the fabric could be a little more substantial for the price, and was disappoitned that even petites, were again, too long... the color is nice enough (neutral), and they definitely look like work pants. they are true to sice, but i could do the low end of my size range.
other A fun, casual romper. i loved the pink color (not usually my thing), which looks great with darker skin. like another reviewer said, the waist is quite small so i would recommend sizing up one or two sizes (i took a size 6 in this, but am usually a 2/4) - this will make the top part a bit blousy, but i think that adds to the appeal/ look.
other Great sweater, perfect weight for the office in the summer. love the delicate knit front and triple tie in the back. it was bigger and baggies than i was expecting, but it still works.
other This is not your traditional moth sweater, in that, it is not soft and cozy. this sweater is great for upcoming summer nights at the beach while fireside or out on the boat! i haven't been the biggest fan of the lace up trend but this one is more traditional nautical feeling than others which i did like. it's pretty true to size, so i wouldnt size up or down for any reason. they paired it with a cloth + stone white button down underneath at our store and it looks great layered too!
other This is a rare review for me, i usually love my retailer purchases, even at times when other reviewers aren't fans, but this top is terrible. 5'4" 103, 3other b for reference, small frame, athletic, bought the xs in black. the length could have been longer, but i could have lived with the length. the arm hole area, however, a different story. because it's boxy, and the fabric is stiffer bc of the large flowers, the top sticks out on the sides under the arm holes leaving a gape, it did not fit snuggly
3 I ordered this top online and was hoping to love it, however it didn't fit me properly...the arm holes were much too large (i'm typically an xs or small) i ordered the small and based on this fit i don't think the extra small would've fit either :( also i thought the material seemed very delicate and somewhat thin....and with 3 kids always hanging on me i don't think this top would last very long...
other The only complaint i would have about this pullover is that it runs a little big. i ordered a small and it is a little big for my taste but it is not something worth returning it for. i wouldn't say to size down but be aware it is larger than what you would expect. still love it!
3 It's not as form fitting & hour-glass shaped in real life as on the model. i think they must have clipped it in the small of her back so it does not look so boxy. otherwise it's nice.
other I don't like how short it is in the back.i also prefer a solid vs. slubby material, back it goes.
other This is one of my favorite new retailer buys. originally got the green for a family holiday party and went back for the sapphire. the cut and design are great. for reference i'm 5'3", 115lbs and a 34a. the light weight fabric is perfect for so cal winter, but the real winning feature(s) is the detail. so, so cute. only complaint is it wrinkled fairly easily, but i'll deal with that for a cute form-fitting (but not too fitting!) top. .
other I love the long tunic with high slits, it's such a great design. i bought this on sale on a whim. i did see that there was already a small snag on the one i purchased right after i took it out of the bag, must have missed that when i looked at it in the store. i still love it, just a little worried based on other reviews that i won't be able to keep from snagging in the future. at the sale price i would say still worth it though!
3 I likded this but tried it in two sizes and it was still too big in the armpit. my bra showed. i am about a d cup, smallish in other proportions (125, 5'6") and no bra worked with this so that i wouldn't have to worry about my bra showing. nice fabric and drape. maybe good for someone who doesn't need a bra?
other This tops is super cute and great transitional shirt for the fall. a little short in the front but still a great shirt.
other This is one of the softest shirts ever! i agree with another reviewer about the shirt not worth the original price but once this shirt hit the sale item, totally worth it.
other Super cute cardigan! can wear it with black tights and boots or shorts when it starts warming up. the color is great! i was hesitant about buying it but thankful i did. will probably buy it in the black, too.
other This dress has a beautiful fabric, i really hated to send it back. it was just so unflattering, absolutely no shape to it. i bought a 0p, i'm 5'5" and 117lbs and it looked like a maternity dress on me.
other The embroidery around the chest/collar is lovely.  but the lower half of the shirt didn't fit my post-pregnancy bod.  it's going back.
other Such a lovely skirt. i plan on wearing it to a formal event, but could definitely see dressing it down with a jean jacket. it is so feminine and beautiful. well made and fits fine.
other This is a true tiny top........gorgeous and runs small. i usually wear a small or medium in retailer tops, but timy i always size up. i'm a 36c, and a large fits perfect. the front is a bit sheer, but not so much you need a cami.
other Love this dress! adorable, comfortable and figure flattering! cant go wrong with this purchase!
other I get a lot of compliments on this dress, it's bright and cheerful for sure! it runs maybe a bit large but is a great summer dress!
other I love dolan dresses! the fabrics are always beautiful, and the colors are always unique. i usually wear an xs petite in dolan, but i ordered both the xs and the xs petite, and i think i'm going to keep the xs. i had a hard time deciding which to keep, but the xs petite was just a hair too short. i think this is a versatile dress for all seasons. you could pair it with tights in fall/winter, but it is great for spring/summer, too...
3 I really liked this top when i saw it online. i went to the store to check the sizes. i am a small or a medium. i tried on the s and the xs. even the xs was huge. unfortunately the xxs is sold out. i don't understand the sizing on this at all. it's a shame because the top itself is very pretty. just be sure you try it on before purchasing.
other I love these jeans. they're incredibly soft, super comfortable and hold their shape. i can wear them for hours on end and i don't get that droopy, snagging look jeans can get when they stretch out.  fit: i am normally a 29/30 depending on the jean. i took these in the 30 - i usually have a difficult time finding skinny jeans that fit my legs and don't fall off my waist. these have enough give to accommodate my larger legs, but the material holds well, so i don't need a belt to keep them up
other Great length, very comfortable, very pretty. perfect dressy winter skirt!
other I got this shirt because of the flutter sleeves, and i'm not disappointed. it is a classic t, with that little bit of an edge due to the sleeves. it is not fitted, which is what i was looking for. it also covers my bum, which i don't always like hanging out there. in all, it's perfect for my needs. i got the turquoise one and i may get the white one too!
other This blouse is very pretty, but the overlap in the front is a little "strange." it seems to fall open and will require either a pretty pin to hold it closed or a cami underneath. despite that "flaw" i am glad that i purchased this blouse. the trim at the shoulders gives it a romantic and special appeal.
other Note: the inseam runs a little longer than stated above. if you are truly a 29" inseam, you may want to get the petite size. i purchased the petite small, my inseam is 27", and the trousers hit the ground in stocking feet. however, the length can be changed depending on where you wear/place them on your hip.i've worn these trousers at home and around town with ease. they are a wonderful cold weather, go-to wardrobe staple. i wear a nylon trouser "slip" with them to prolong the need for cleaning
other I ordered the large, but it swallowed me. the store happened to have a medium, so i was able to make an exchange. the medium fit perfect. i'm delighted to include this in my wardrobe!
other This dress is the perfect combination of beauty and comfort. the quality is excellent with a forgiving fit. it could be paired with black heels for a formal look or flats for a an easy date night. i just cannot say enough positive things about it!
other Went to the local store today for something else and left with this in the cream color. it is just simply awesome. i could have worn the s but felt that the m would be a little better. i'm between a s and m most of the time. can't say enough good things about the quality and versatility of this sweater. great piece for cooler summer nights and for a cover up for pilates/yoga. can't wait to wear it and now i'm tempted by the teal.
other I've been scouting retailer's store, looking for short sleeved tops at a reasonable price point.this fit the bill. the flouncy sleeves are a bit much for my typical wardrobe, but a fun addition. i love the fact that there's extra fabric built in to make the armholes smaller, therefore no need for a cami underneath.i purchased the black and white in medium (typically medium to large, 5'4", 34g).
other This dress is beautifully made, and has a lovely sheen to it. it's elegant and can be worn on different occasions. it's a very feminine dress. i ordered the dress in a few sizes and a size other fit me the best as i have a small bust line.
other I would have loved this dress if the bust and waist were just a little more fitted. i am 32c and the top was too big. fit perfectly on hips. the lace material means it cannot be easily altered, so i chose to return the dress. i would have definitely kept it if it were a better fit.
other Great top for all seasons. hides imperfections, flatters hourglass shapes. and great thickness/weight to fabric. i'm wearing it to a concert with skinny moto jeans and booties! side zip is excellent feature and great quality.
other I have another paper crown dress that is a favorite. this dress has the same quality and i love the print, which is somewhere between abstract and almost animal. unfortunately, the fit did not work for me. i am large-busted and need a bra. this dress cuts in at the shoulders and did not work with any of my bras except strapless. also, the waist cinches but without a defined band. this looked a bit more frumpy. again, i suspect the fault is in my figure, not the dress.for someone with a smaller
3 After seeing this dress online and noticing how quickly it sold out, i was curious about it, but thought i was out of luck. it just so happened that i ran into the store and they had one returned in my size. i tried it and wasn't sold. however, i loved the color. it was snug across the shoulders and arms. the rest was somewhat flowy, but boxy at the same time. i ended up bringing it home to think on it. after trying it on again, i realized the snugness across the shoulder really caused the top t
other Oh i simply can't say enough about this dress... it's just so pretty! i've sometimes had trouble with beaded pieces from retailer but not this dress. it's a very flattering piece and the material is comfortable and soft. really flattering. you can dress it up or down as well - i'm glad i'll be able to wear this into fall with a leather jacket.
other The fabric is beautiful.  didn't wrinkle so much after 8 hours in a suitcase.  as opposed to the other reviewer mine arrived neatly, stripes match nicely.  i am kind of thick waisted and the size 6 was still perfect for me - i am currently 130 lbs, 34-28-35.  love the colors and the fabric, a nice cotton twill, lined, pockets, pretty bow belt.  i am not a fan of the size zipper style but it is not a deal breaker.  glad i have them !!
other These are adorable pants!!! i ordered them in both colors because i couldn't decide which was cuter. they are light and airy, but not see through. they will be perfect to use as a swim coverup, pajamas, dress them up, anything. very comfortable and versatile! i am a size 8 and ordered a medium and they fit perfect. the elastic doesn't pinch, but probably would have if i would have went with a small.
other This is a great dress that i was eyeing for some time. i bought it after new year's with the 40% off discount. unfortunately the dress arrived with a defect so i have to have it fixed.the quality of the dress is amazing. the details are truly unique. one could tell that the dress is very well made. however, it does run large. i bought the xs and feel that i could have downsized at least one to two sizes! it's very comfortable and it could be dressed up or down.overall, im happy with the purc
other Even in my usual petite small size, this looked bulky and made me look stumpy. disappointing because the style looks so good in the picture and the material looks to be good quality. i don't even know if going down a size would have helped. as others have mentioned it looks like a frumpy house robe.
other Love the rushed sleeves, and the flower pattern on the side. t shirt is, however, a little thin, hence a bit sheer. but i loved it nonetheless... i saw the loose fit and decided ot order a size down (xxs petite) ad it is so flattering. going to keep it as i don't think petite is going to make it to sale... i think it will look very cute with my denim pencil skirt, jeans or other pants for casual days!
other I tried this on in store but didn't purchase it due to price, then kicked myself afterwards when my size was sold out online. i really wanted the gray. i finally was able to order my size when it was restocked very briefly and am so happy i did. this is such a cute poncho.i also have the angel of the north poncho from last winter, and don't like that one nearly as much. that one was too long; this one is the perfect length. it curves down in the front and back, and then comes up at the sides r
3 I loved this trench on the web site, i couldn't wait until it arrived and was even happy to pay full-price to get it! it unfortunately just didn't complement my 5'2" 13other lb curvy figure as i had hoped. it was definitely much fuller on the bottom which added unnecessary bulk. i have narrow shoulders and it was snug and uncomfortable with a simple tank top on. i hung it in my closet for a few weeks, tags intact, continuing to try it and each time it just wasn't working. it also had many stray thre
other I thought the design was adorable. i ordered up bc of reviews and i am glad i did. i am a size 6 so i ordered a size 8. the upsize is needed so u can get into the top part of the romper. otherwise it would be mission impossible. it's a pain to get on and off as all rompers are but it's soo cute it's worth it. had compliments on it the first day i wore it.
other Wonderful dress! thank you for making a fun and sassy dress that actually fits me! normally this sort of dress wouldn't fit, with it failing me in the bust, but it fit quite well. in most cases, i would end-up in a 1other petite to accommodate my bust, but with it then too large in the shoulders, or, the dress would have run so small, i wouldn't have been able to button it in most places. i was pleasantly surprised not only with the fit, but the quality, as well.as described by other reviewers, it
other I really like the gentle flow of the fabric. this top can be worn casual or dressy by adding jewelry or or a scarf.
other I like these pants. they fit nice but they are sheer which is not a problem for me. my only issue was that the print is not symmetrical as shown in the picture. the print is what drew me to these pants. the pattern is all over the place in the ones i received. they are nice so i will keep them at the sale price but i don't think they would be worth it at full price.
other Ii'm not usually big on lace but this is so unique and versatile that i went for it. looks good dressed up w/a nice top or casual w/a tee. can be worn practically all year. love it!
3 Love the dress and went a size up as recommended by other reviewers. but it was still too small. it's just not roomy enough in the chest--total boob squash. had to return it.
other Great mock neck fits well and looks great with pants and skirts!! also love the dark grey color!!
other I am 5'5" normally about 120lb, but i'm about 145lb now at 9 months prego. i purchased the small. i can't resist buying retailer clothes, even though they might not fit me currently! however, because this shirt is drapey, it actually fits over my baby bump now and it will be perfect as a nursing shirt and then regular shirt later. it is so soft and great quality. will be cute dressed up for work or down with jeans!
3 This top is beautiful! but the fabric is really stiff and itchy. in addition, it's rather cropped or short. the real disaster and heart break for me was when i washed it. the tag recommends dry cleaning, but allows for hand washing. i should have dry cleaned - it shrunk even more when i washed it on delicate setting in cold. too bad, because this looks so cute the first time you wear it. if you're up for a dry cleaning bill and don't mind a little stiff scratchy material, you'll be fine buying t
other I loved this shirt from the moment i saw it on the table. i am always too tall for a peplum blouse because they hit my rib cage instead of my waist, but this shirt doesn't have that problem! i have the white one, the polka dots are a really pretty corn flower blue color. i usually wear an 8 in maeve blouses, but this one i took a 6. there is definately no give though. i have a very flat chest and only wear a lacy bralette under this shirt because there is no room for anything else. i am sad thou
other Ordered this dress online, and i love it! i was looking for an understated but fun new years dress and this was exactly what i was looking for. the only minor qualm i had about the dress was that the velvet dots that hit where the seams met made the dress look puffier than it should some parts around the waist, but for the most part, the dress fit very well and was very flattering, may just need a little bit of ironing. i am 5'9 and usually am more conscious of how things fit around my hips, and
other I am a brand loyal ag fan. best washes, best pocket placement and these are no exception. they do run a little big. i usually wear a 26 or 27 in the stilts depending on the fabric content. i tried these in the 26 and 25. both fit, but i went with the 2other because these will stretch at least 1/other size. the distressing is the right amount, however i gave other stars because one area is directly over the knee which i don't care for. solved it by having a seamstress reinforce the back of it with a similar
other I love the colors of this dress, and i waited for the sale since it isn't really good for work. i wear size 6 in hd all the time, but this one doesn't fit at all on the top. the bust is cut for someone really curvy, but the bottom is for someone really straight. i don't know what they were using for a model, but this has to be tried on before purchased. the material is also rough, and there is no lining to protect you from that. i love my hd dresses for style and functionality, but this one is j
other This is a great dress - it definitely runs true to size and is on the border of running a little small. if you're on the fence about which size to order go with the larger size.the fabric moves nicely but wrinkles easily when packed. love the color.got a ton of compliments :)
other I love this dress! i ordered a petite size and just love how it fits. i would highly recommend this dress, too cute!
other Gorgeous pattern, even prettier in person! runs slightly large in my opinion, could size down. nice to have as a petite option.
other I got this in the teal and the color is beautiful and i get so many compliments! definitely size down. i am athletic and usually a m and i ordered a small.
other I just got this top and can't wait to wear it for spring/summer! it is a lovely lightweight material and hangs loosely and comfortably. it definitely runs quite large so i would at the very least consider ordering on the small side of what you normally wear if not sizing down one completely. this is coming from someone who usually likes tops on the roomier side, so trust me on this! overall, i highly recommend this top if you're looking for a muted but unique, comfy top for the warmer months ahe
other I love this sweatshirt. it's super chic and sexy (and for those of us that need actual support, it looks great with a strappy sports bra).  that said, selling this as "one size fits all" is misleading, at best.  i'm 5'2, ~160 (a lot of it muscle, but i enjoy chorizo), a 34ddd, and this fit me perfectly, but i can't imagine it would work for anyone much larger than a size 12.  just be real -- this is a smedium. one star removed for the "one size fits all" fallacy.
other I love this shirt. i ordered a large because i am taller, and i wanted the length to be right. while it's a little baggy, it's still very flattering and i've received lots of compliments on it. the color is exactly what is show in the image. it's a versatile shirt; depending on what you pair it with it can be appropriate for work, dinner, or a night out. i'd definitely recommend this shirt to a friend.
other Yes, this runs big but i sized down from med to small and it works. i like the gray/white pattern. received compliments upon first wearing and know i'll wear it often. i knocked off a star because of the rayon fabric which wrinkles so easily. this top always looks rumpled in the back from sitting. still i'm glad to have it in my fall wardrobe.
other Runs a little big. fabric is very soft and comfortable
other I wanted to love this kimono...it is such a beautiful color and would work well with so many things in my wardrobe, but alas it went back due to the strange feel of the fabric...not a soft touch and because it runs small. i bought the m/l and usually wear a 12/1other but i couldn't bring the kimono together in the front (for a belting option).
other I first saw this dress in one of the stores and the rich colors caught my eye. this dress is very comfortable to wear but is also unique. the fabric feels great on and gives the dress an overall stylish flair. the photo doesn't do it justice!
other I thought these were pretty on the website, but in person they look like a work of art! the colors are vivid -- bright reds, pinks, greens, blues, yellow -- with flora, fauna, houses, writing, type and so many other things on a white and cream background. they are very soft, medium-weight flannel. for me they run true to size. i wish they had pockets, though!
other I often find wearing anything described as 'slim' difficult, but these pants are absolutely wonderful. i bought in a size 1other regular length. they are perfect, both in fit and quality.
3 The color and embellishment of this top are beautiful. this would look great on anyone super lean, otherwise you just look really wide as there is no frame in the torso of this top at all. the back picture shows it well. i am 5'9, 14other lbs and i ordered the small and medium and both were huge! with regrets going back.
other I absolutely love these sleepwear pants. they are lightweight, soft, good fit and quality and the design is really pretty!! a steal at this price.
other This top is gorgeous!!! the picture just does not do it justice. i bought it solely based on the one review that said it looks very good. and it does! the velvet work at the top makes it look very dressy. the sleeves are not with big holes that show too much, the top and sleeves are perfect. i really like this top. i can't believe that the photo doesn't show it's gorgeousness, it looks so much better in-person. i so wish it came in more colors!!
3 Super cute, flattering design but the material is itchy so it's going back:(
other This is the dress that i have been waiting for all season. perfect color. the material is also "firm" without being heavy or thick (if you know what i mean). it lays flat and smooths out any bumps without being overly stiff. the v-neck is also not too deep and the sleeves are not too short. overall, a complete win. now go and make it in gray and navy blue please.
3 I love this skirt and wish i could keep it. but it is not for the vertically challenged. i am 5'0" 130 lbs and the medium petite was about other in too long, even with wedges. my intent was to wear this with sandals so i have to return. boo.
other This is a great top! i love the color of the pink... it is the perfect color of pink; not too bright or too light, but a pretty pink-coral spring color! i am fair skinned and this color looks great on.i got the 0 regular and it fits perfect. i am 5'2" and 110lbs. i usually get petite but i can't imagine this shirt being shorter... it's a great length. i can wear it slightly tucked in or out without it looking sloppy. it also hides any belly issues for those mamas out there. love it! perfect fo
3 I fell in love with this trench when i first saw it online but ended up returning it once i tried it on. i'm 5'9, 140 lbs and the m fit true to size. but the belt hit above my natural waistline and the skirt of the coat was much fuller than i expected, making me look heavier. the material also wrinkles easily and the stitching was poor quality with lots of loose threads. disappointed, as the color and concept were great.
other This is such a pretty dress. light and flowy. i got it to wear on hot summer days.
other The dress is lovely and fits true to size. i like the petite fit. i would note, however, the dress length does not match the description. the description states the dress falls 45" from shoulder. i measured it at 40 inches. it is definitely shorter than i was expecting.
3 But i didn't like the fit. maybe because i ordered petite and the length threw me off, but they weren't flattering in any way. the color and material were unique and pleasing. had to send them back though.
other The only negative thing i have to say is that the color in person is different than the picture- it is much more of a coral pink than a rosy pink, which is fine just a tad unexpected! i ordered a size 8 and it fits perfectly (32ddd chest). the laser cut outs in the yoke add a very nice feminine, unique touch to an otherwise basic top. i can't wait to wear it!
other Easy, fun and flattering. fits tts. i normally wear a m/l or 10/12. i ordered a large and it fits well. the tie at the back lets you wear it as tight or loose as you want it. the length is good for my 5'9 frame.
other I tried this top on in the store and didn't buy it because i was in a hurry. obsessed about it and it was sold out when i went back. so happy i was able to get it online, it's beautiful. i got a medium and it fits perfectly, enough room that it hangs nicely but not baggy, i'm typically a medium in shirts at retailer. it looks beautiful with high waisted black pants. i wear a cami underneath. i own it in white and tried it on with a black bra only and it looked great, i just didn't feel comfortable
other It's an adorable take on the "casual" sweatshirt. i love the layers, but i wish they were just a little different. they hang a little strange. perhaps if the bottom one was a smidge longer? i'm not sure. or if the sweatshirt layer was a little longer and the blouse bit was therefore longer. it all hangs just a little...off? but, it's not so off that it looks bad. i'm petite, so it's cute on, but, i think if you were tall, it might hang a little weird. a warning though, i ordered a small, and the
other I'm a size xl and i'm busty, so my review might not apply to everyone..i really wanted this jacket to work, however, it did not. i tried this jacket on in my usual size xl and it was nowhere near the correct size. this jacket runs small. i don't see how anyone with a bust is going to be able to button this jacket. the jacket is not lined and it is very fitted, so putting the jacket on and taking it off will require a very thin shirt to be worn underneath..the style of the jacket is very
other Love love the print on these but the fit is off. i tried on the solid color in this same style and i took my regular size 30. these i needed a 12. the waist seems really small but the bottom leg parts stretch out and are kind of baggy after other wear. i can't go down a size because the waist was too small on the 10. since i love the print so much it may be tolerable. rare for hei hei to fit wonky.
3 I loved the colors on this dress, but i don't like the way it fits. it is tight around the shoulders, but the rest of the dress is really big and has no shape
3 The xxs petite fit great except in bust and shoulder area. i'm a 32a and it was really tight.
other This shirt drapes beautifully. forgiving fabric in a beautiful taupe. it is a bit low cut, i wear a camisole underneath. true to size.
other Soft and cozy every day tee that can be dressed up or worn casually. only compliant is i wish it came in more colors!
other I purchased the coral version, and the color is wonderful and vibrant. it fit my daughter beautifully, and she is 5'10". i think she will be wearing this coat often, she loves it!!! she is 23 years old and has a professional job, so she will look the part.
other I love this dress but the top runs very small. i am 5'5, 10other lbs, small frame and the 0 was tight. 0 is my go to size at retailer. i had to return it. i wish i had bought the other now.
other Overall: a super comfy dress that you can wear anywhere. short, petite ladies beware though; the dress does not hang at your natural waist like it shows in the model's photos. in order for me to have it sit at my waist, the dress was folded over and did not flatter.
other Love these crops. fitted through hips with full legs. at 5'7 and 125, the 27 fit perfect. these look great with block heels and wedges. denim is lightweight, perfect for fall.
3 This dress is such a crazy beautiful color, the picture doesn't do it justice. i ordered this right when i saw it, and i almost love it. the color is very bright and the fabric seems nice, but i just didn't find it flattering at all. the slip wasn't the nicest, but completely not a deal breaker. i didn't think it was overly flattering on the model either, so i was hoping by some miracle that i would like it anyway, but something about the way it's cut is just a little off for me. it was very tru
other I didn't buy it for the longest time based on the other reviews but i finally did and i love it. great color, great quality, great fit. oh and great price too! i say - go for it.
other This is one of the cutest jackets i have ever owned. nice soft material. i have a steamer so won't have to iron this, depends on how picky you'd be about that. great cut. ordered my normal size. sending another jacket back that luckily i hadn't worn yet. i know between the two, i will always pick this one. didn't find the sleeves too long which was good as no petite option. seriously so excited to wear this. :)
other I want to hate these jeans because they are so expensive but every time i try these on they just look so cool. they seem to be handmade so the flowers are not in the same spot on each pair.
other Just a ginormous, shapeless shirt. runs extremely large. i am normally a medium to large in shirts and the medium was huge. i can only imagine an xs would work and i am no xtra small!
other I purchased this dress in our retailer store. i usually wear either a 0 or other petite (5'1", 11other lbs.). i was able to wear a 0r in this and it fit perfectly. i paired it with a sparkly belt from retailer for a cocktail party and received lots of compliments.
other This dress is a beautiful classic ! i am 5"3 113 size 0 fits perfectly !
other Tried the size small, regular. me: 5'6", 34/35a-28-36, straightish shape, broader shoulders.it's described as slim fit but i found the small to be a loose fit on me. i would almost consider trying the xs if i wanted something less baggy...but i think the style is meant to be very laidback. i tried to picture the extra material i had.the color is a lovely denim blue and the length on me was just as the website describes. deep v neck but not to the point where i feel i'd need a cami, those of
other Bought these and they fit really well and are super comfy. love the color. will probably live in them this summer!
other I loved everything about this dress except the length. that fabric is great, the width of the dress was great...not too slim but not too baggy. but the front & side length was the problem. it is longer in the back which was great. i could have even dealt with the front length, but for my age, the way the sides came up fairly high, just couldn't work for me.i you are younger and okay with showing lots of leg, go for it! its really cute!
3 I had a really, really difficult time reviewing this dress. the instant i touched it, i wanted to love it! in theory, it should have worked for me. fit and flare is usually a really great option for my pear shape. the silhouette shows off my thinner upper body and camouflages my thicker lower body. best of both worlds! however, as you can see for yourself in the photo, this dress makes me look pretty big. i'm a solid size 8 and i feel this dress makes me look like a 12. it really makes my middle
other Not a pretty blouse - it's quite utilitarian in design - and it runs enormous.
other Bypassed this blouse online, but it's striking colors caught my eye at the store. bought the olive green color and it's gorgeous! the color is great for both spring and fall. i'm normally a petite xs at 5'0 feet and 10other pounds, the regular xs is a great fit for me. not too boxy and the length hits right at my waist. material is lighweight and flowey. don't hesitate to buy, it's a great piece to add some pop of color and goes great with skinny jeans..
other I had been waiting for this skirt to go on sale as i fell in love with the style and print on the website. however, after receiving it in the mail i was disappointed to find that the cut was all wrong for my body type. i am 5'6", size 4, hourglass/athletic. the xs was too big and made me look like i had no shape. would be cute on a girl with no hips/booty but unflattering on hourglass figure.
other This dress is so well made, but it's a lot of dress. i think i would have liked it if it were shorter. it felt a little too 50s housewife to me, and i was hoping for a flowing material. it wasn't worth the price to me so i sent it back.
other This sweater was so itchy i immediately was turned off. it looks cute in pictures but another problem was that the knitting in the shoulders looks like a kid made it. it was uneven and stretched out. it looked like it was not well made to me. it also shed so much that just from me trying it on my pants were covered in orange fuzz. i returned this one.
other First the good: what a beautiful, figure flattering dress. the fabric is stiff feeling, but the dress is well lined, so you can't see through it, and it hides lumps and bumps well. feels very quality. the lining also means it isn't scratchy. the stripes are very figure flattering for apple shapes like me (i'm 5'5", 16other and thick through the waist...this dress gives me the illusion of actually having a waist. l fit perfectly), and i love the saucy little cut out over the knee: not so high that yo
other This dress runs large so i sized down. when it arrived i looked at it and thought the fabric was ugly and boring for a dress. it sat there for about two weeks till i tried it on. i love it! it is so comfortable and is so cute how the pockets hang. all it need is some long necklaces or a scarf to complete the look. i get complements on it everytime i wear it. my only complaint is that it peels under the arms a little bit.
other Loved it! i am curvy and it is very hard to find a dress that looks easy and at the same time shapes you. the various cuts of the different prints are placed in the right place in the body . easy dress and beautiful. there should be more dresses in this style in different color combos.
other This is no exception to the rule! i love turtlenecks and this one is going to be a favorite. do know that this is not lightweight-even though this is sleeveless it is definitely a substantial knit. the color is a beautiful nutmeg and can be dressed up or down. i purchased a gorgeous neutral beaded necklace to go with it and it is simply stunning! it does 'bell out' a little at the bottom which, in my opinion-is the only design flaw. i normally wear a medium in most retailer tops and the small is a
other I'm a slightly pear shaped girl. a c chest with size 1other hips. the dress fit great around my waist and would have been perfect except the space in the chest area was too big. it looked odd on me with all the extra fluff in the chest. fabric is nice and flowy. the dress is lined.
other Sadly, this has to go back. i am 5'5", 128 lbs and this shirt is super short on me. very short. and it's so wide it's almost a trapeze cut. the overall effect is 50s/60s style maternity shirt. which is disappointing because the fabric is beautiful, the detail is nice in person, even the sleeve cuffs are great. i am not very tall and i'm fairly thin on top so i can get away with a lot of styles, loose and tight. the combo of short and trapeze is just unflattering.
other I tried this dress in my usual size 4. the slip underneath was a big snug but the dress was fine. i sort of looked like a little girl in this dress. it is very pretty but more for the younger girls~not for the over 50 group.
other I was sad that this was only online because i wanted to try on the xs and small to compare. i usually wear an xs in most antrho clothes, and i decided to get an xs because i was afraid the peplum part would be large. however, when i got it in the mail, the xs is too small! i tried to get it in a size up, but i couldn't find it. it's a cute shirt, but it runs small. even the length of the shirt is shorter than i would have liked. if they had the correct size, i would have gotten it, but this shir
other Can't wait for the weather to cool so i can wear this! the split back makes it very flattering. the 'green' is definitely more brown.
other When i first saw this i thought it was a bit boxy but i was drawn to the colors. the arm-holes are a little large and i got an xs (normally wear a size 2), so i will probably wear a tank underneath, but overall the fit is relaxed and comfortable. i love the colors. it has a little longer length (i'm 5'5"). i see this being cute with white jeans, blue jeans. love it!
other I loved this dress the moment i first saw it! i have another dress from this brand that i've had for a couple years and wear it all the time plus i love the tie waist detail. however after trying this dress in both a size medium (my typical size) and a small, i've given up. it does not look good on me and i think thats because i am a 34b, there is room in the chest even in the size small. so would look really good on a curvy girl! i'm 5'5" ordered regular size and it came to just above my knees.
other I ordered this top in my usual size and am exchanging it for one size smaller.it runs very generous, and so the sizing is a little off.the style and quality are beautiful, so i am anxious to receive the smaller size.
other First off, this runs very large. i'm normally an 8 and sized down to the 6 but probably could have done a 4. it looked like a tent on me. the top part is lovely, i just think the bottom is way to large and not flattering. this one is definitely going back especially with all the white dress options they have out now.
other This is a great sweater just to throw on with jeans or a skirt. simple and the tie on the back gives it a feminine flare
other I bought this dress last week for a wedding next summer. it did not appeal to me on the hanger, but once i tried it on, i was so impressed. the green color is lovely and it is lightweight and airy, and it does have a lining which is a plus. i love the little ruffle sleeves and the tie in the back is perfect. there have been comments about the hemline being awkward but the length on me was perfect and has just the right amount of flounce to be feminine. i can't wait to wear this dress! (i am 5'6"
other I bought this dress in-store, and it's fantastic. i'm between a medium and a large, and i bought a large because it was the one available, and it's fantastic. some of the polyester is fraying between the seams, which is obviously not ideal, but i'm willing to overlook that for generally how great this dress is.
other This tank is fairly soft and fits true to size. i like that i can pick between a v or round neck, depending on my outfit. it truly offers a profile to layer with anything. the only complaint i have is that the edging wears faster than the rest of the tank. i've trimmed some pilling off of it to keep it looking neat. otherwise, this is one of my favorite tanks, and i have purchase two more so i can always find one when i want it. this tank has some stretch, so i imagine it fits a range of siz
other I generally wear a small or medium in tops, and decided to get the medium/large. it's over-sized, but it lays very nicely and doesn't look "frumpy". the back of the shirt is exactly as it looks in the picture. the front of the shirt is more of a solid blue than is shown, but still lovely.
other The dress is nice, love the embroidery, love the front cinch but why not all the way around? the back is fast flat so cinching makes the sides stick out..got petite and the sizing was nice. i just didn't love the overall look on my body type.
other The design and quality were great. i really wanted them to fit but they ran large. i'm 5'other and 120 lbs and orderd the small. unfortunately the fit seemed off as well and i won't be trying a size down. the waist and hips were huge but the thigh area was fitted enough that a smaller size would have been awkward. sadly these went back.
other This dress is my personal introduction to talented indian designer, ranna gill. i just love this gorgeous, free- spirited dress! i bought the regular medium for my 5'1", 34f, size 8 figure. it works very well. i will want to wear a black cami, as i'm not comfortable with some cleavage showing (maybe 3/4") and the open lines of lacy, small holes down the front and back. you might not mind showing more skin though and not need a cami. the top is not very see-through, and the skirt is lined. the re
other This shirt is so comfortable! the fabric is amazingly soft and it is very well made. i liked the top so well that i bought one in grey and one in blue, and both in different sizes so that the smaller (xs) is a little closer fitting and the larger (s) is more blouse and casual. i had originally purchased both in m (which also looked fine, just larger and even more roomy), but exchanged for the smaller sizes. this is a wonderful casual weekend top to pair with skinny jeans, flats, leather boots, o
other I got fooled by this dress's description. it's 100% polyester and not wool as it claims to be! looks cheap.returned it!
3 I really like the color of this and the feel, but that is where it ends. it does not come with the gorgeous flattering belt that it is pictured with, and is cut without shape so it does not fit to your body and show off any glorious womanly curves. i could purchase the belt with it, but i don't prefer to purchase products that cannot stand on their own.
other This dress was built for my body to disguise it's flaws. i did have to size up because i am broad shouldered, busty, with a tummy pooch and no hips. this dress skims along all that mess and makes me look slimmer. received the package today and am wearing it right now, i'm so happy! i ordered size 10, my stats are 5'3" 145# 36dd.
other I purchased this dress online after two reviews and i am so glad i did. this is a work of art and beauty and will be my go to dress for spring and summer weddings, special occasions and other events. i am so glad the arms are covered with lace and flowers. this is spectacular.
other I love the fit and feel of this shirt. the fit is narrow but true to size. the stitching details are beautiful and make this shirt really versatile.
3 The material is soft and the pattern is pretty, but it fits like a sack. it's too bad that this wasn't more form-fitting, with some stretch and a zipper, because its fit is just not beautiful. for tall, very slender ladies, this will be pretty, as it is in the photo. it fit me just fine (with a little extra room on top), but it went right back into the bag without a thought.
other I wore this to a wedding yesterday and received several compliments. the dress is well made and very comfortable. i know i will wear it again.
other These shorts are comfortable but so stylish. even though, i love many of retailer shorts, these are one of my favorites.
other These are the softest jeans ever! i love the way that they hold their shape, and make my bum look amazing!! i am 5'3" and they do come much longer than shown on the model...right below my ankle bone. i actually prefer this because they will be wearable right through fall if i pair them with booties! the fit is true to size...108 pounds and i got a 25. highly recommend!!
3 Way too big and unflattering. i would love it to look like it does online but it's huge in person.
3 I fell in love with the shirt when i saw it online; but, i was incredibly disappointed with it when it was delivered.  on the positive side, the macrame is stunning.  once again, there was way too much fabric which makes me look pregnant.  most importantly, the color is not peach!  it's almost a burnt indian red or brick red/orange.  it was a disgusting color.
other This is a beautiful sweater. the color is not bright red, rather a dark coral. nonetheless it is much better looking in person than in the web photo. i only have one complaint which may be reason enough for me to return an otherwise perfect sweater. i wore this for approximately three hours today and could not believe the pilling under the arms and side of chest area. some pilling is normal and expected on any sweater but if this continues at the rate it appears to be going, i will contact retailer
3 I'm 5'1" and this top was too long for me. it's pretty but expensive for what it is.
other I purchased the gray motif with the bright flower design. i have owned many blouses in my lifetime, but i must say this is one of the best fitting and most attractive of most any i have ever owned. it falls just right on my body and is smooth and luxurious with a silky feel. the cuffs fall on my wrists just perfectly. the color is just right for my fair skin and light hair. this was my first order from you and if this is any indication of the quality and fit i will receive i'll do a lot more ord
other It was love at first sight. the only problem was that it didn't come in my size. i took a chance and order a size smaller and it worked out great. its a great item that can be worn in the spring and fall. exactly what i was looking for.
other Tried this dress on in a s and it fit very nicely.  it's a very unique dress and i loved it, but i just didn't know where i would wear it!
other This jumpsuit is so, so cute. i tried it on in an xs in store but needed a petite. i ordered the xsp online, received it, but honestly it's still a little big. the xxsp is sold out, but i love the piece so much i think i'm going to have it taken in. trust me, it's just as cute as it looks, if not cuter!
other This blouse combines two things i love - swing tops and bows. just received this and am very pleased. the blue version is very pretty. i recently purchased another top by the same brand and ordered a 6. for this, i ordered a small and am glad i did. i would suggest ordering your regular size (the top is fitted, the bottom is very fluid).
other I was hoping not to like this tee so that i can be $48 richer (lol). it's very cute. i would say runs true, but more on the smaller side. i usually wear xs and it's a good cut for me. it's not boxy at all. i love the strap detail on this tee. i hope the quality will hold up. for reference i am 5'3 and 123lbs (2/4).
other This dress is so pretty. the tulle underskirt was a fun surprise and the subtle striping in the dress so classy. the dress is true to size. my main concern was making sure the top part would fit around my chest. it fits perfectly.
other These are nice and light weight and comfortable
other I bought this late in the season and love the way it fits and looks.
other Love this dress. i bought is for a tropic vacation my husband and i went on and it was great. i got so many compliments while wearing it, and it was comfortable! dress is a little roomy in the top, but not enough to prevent me from wearing it. i ordered a medium.
other Bought this dress in the blue and absolutely love it! it looked big in person, but when i tried it on it fit perfectly. i'm other foot 120 lbs and got the petite small. the colors are vibrant and will really stand out. cant wait to wear it!
other This gorgeous dress arrived today and i can't wait to wear it. based on other reviews i ordered a 6 petite even though i'm 5'6" because i wanted the skirt to hit just above my knee. it's perfect. i usually wear a other or 6 and the 6p fits well, not snug but not big either. maybe a 6r would be larger, i don't know. if you are worried about the skirt being too long then definitely try a petite size. the dress is risquã© because it's faux "see through" but still very classy and elegant. it's sexy w
other I was hesitant in purchasing these without trying them on first, but i'm happy i did. they are higher quality than the typical legging. the sizing runs bigger than average.
other Although i haven't worn it yet, it is very soft and functional. i will watch how i wash it so it stays that way.
other Pretty pyjama pants that can be worn running errands, dropping off kids.
other I'm 140 at 5' 8". pear shape. the pockets really opened up when i put them on and didn't lay flat. loose on leg opening - which i liked. but the pockets sticking out around the hip area made my pear shape even wider. i got a medium
other After reading the previous review, i was pretty confident in ordering this dress. it arrived in the mail today, and i was so disappointed. first of all, it's huge. the medium was way too big on me, and i'm never a small at retailer! (i even considered ordering the large in this - my normal size at retailer.) second, the colors are not as vibrant as in the photo, and the fabric felt cheap. finally, it just looked like i went to hawaii and bought a drab dress there that didn't fit right.
3 I bought this scarf/dress for 20% off on mother's day weekend. i really like how it looks and can be worn over a bathing suit or just as a dress, but it is not worth the money. it is poor quality, a scarf stitched together with an attached chord that you tie around your neck. you can make this yourself or wait until it is at least 50% off the original price.
other I got two of these when they went on sale because i hate paying $68 for a basic top like this.. but for the sale price they are great! comfortable, lightweight, and flattering. the black is a little sheer, but nothing a tank underneath can't solve. a good buy!
other This is such a cute top. i like it both off and on the shoulder. easily tucked or left out depending how you want to style it.
other I have been looking for leather or faux leather pants for a while, and these look great. they are more expensive than other faux leather pants, but the quality is much higher. i'm glad i didn't buy the cheap "leather look" pants i keep seeing. the only caveat is that they do run small, like the other reviewers said. i am a 27 pretty consistently in this brand, but i got the 28. they fit perfectly. because of the material on the back, they do not lose their shape, either. highly recommended.
other I bought this top because i loved the floral print. i had no idea i was getting a top notch quality top. i love the flow of the bottom and the zipper in the back is so classy. it has a lining and the coolest thing about it is the snaps that protect your bra from showing. love love love this top!!
other This has such a beautiful shape, goes with so many things and has gotten a lot of compliments already. my favorite new piece.
other Ordered online, hedging my bets on size (chose xs/s) because i have broad shoulders and muscular arms and wear anything from 2-8 sizes depending on brand. my gamble paid off - it&#39;s a beautiful sweater. soft, comfortable, nice drape.(i suspect that finer-boned more petite customers might complain of swimming in this, but it worked well for me!)
other This is a beautiful dress. it fits true to size. i have some issues around the middle and this just flows away from the body. i am 5'5" and it falls to the knee on me, longer than pictured on the model. the fabric is a nice weight that can be worn three seasons. the print is pretty and romantic. i'm planning to wear this to my daughter's very informal wedding and know i'll be comfortable and look put together. this was a lucky find!
other I loved this dress when i saw it online! i could not wait until i see in one of the local stores.  i bought it today! unlike other reviews, i think this dress runs large. i am a other and bought the zero. maeve tends to run large on me. i would suggest that you try a size smaller. it looks very flattering!
other Personally i love cloth and stone. . this top however sheer is still a nice top to have in my rotation. it is thin, lightweight, and sheer but with a cami or nude bra can be pulled off nicely.. i did find the top to be tts for me but the sleeves were snug. i purchased this on sale with extra 30 percent off so i was justified in getting it..
other I loved the jumpsuit the moment i saw it in the catalogue and luckily there was one returned to the store near me! i am 5'10" and 140 pounds. the small fit perfectly, but the zipper on the top section was so difficult to use that i would need help every morning to get dressed. the zipper was missing a couple prongs and i had to make the return.
other Bought the blue/gray - love the color. just the right amount of cling. adorable alone or under cardigan. super deal on sale.
3 I love tunics and really wanted this to work. i got this in a size s and it is absolutely gigantic. everything else about it is great, and i still haven't decided if i will try to swap it for an xs, which is definitely not my usual size (which is usually m, but often s at retailer). the pink/red color was quite pretty. if you have broad hips, fear not - you can size down and this top will still be generous around your hips. basically, if you're deliberating between s and m for this top, get
other First, this vest is made by elevenses. i love this menswear inspired vest. it's simple and structured, however, it's long on my 5'other frame. the price is also a little steep, but it will add a nice touch to a simple outfit. i plan on taking this to a tailor to take an inch or two off the bottom.
other I love this jacket over a dress! it's snug fitting so can't wear anything bulky under it, but super stylish and comfy stretchy material. it's a bit pricey but i get a lot of wear out of it so worth it to me.
other One of 3 pair of leggings ordered and the only pair to fit properly! size l was perfect for me. they stretched nicely going on and the beautiful floral design on the legs didn't get distorted or faded looking from the stretch. wearing these makes me happy :)
other I am keeping this because i got a great deal (30% off sale price), it fits great (i alternate between xs and s, went with s), and overall it has nice quality (thick fabric, secure toggles, etc.), but--what is with the lack of lining? i would hesitate to buy anything from this brand at full price because of that. there are just large seams on the inside, which is tolerable because of the type of fabric, but come on.
3 Very cute dress, just way too big. i ordered it online, wish i would have gone a size smaller.
other The material on this dress is gorgeous. so soft! the fit is flattering and casual and looks great with booties or high boots!
other Stunning! very well made. the colors are so vibrant and stand out without being too flashy. the cut is a bit strange but it works. runs true to size. i took my normal size 0. i rarely buy anything at retailer full price, but i made an exception with this one. a must buy!
other I was so surprised to find this in the sale. it is beautiful. light and airy while lined. the color is bright and fun. it is so comfortable. i ordered an xs based on reviews (this is my typical size in this type of style) and it fit great. i ordered the regular length even though i am only 5'4". i am about 120#. will be an easy "go to" skirt to throw on for a casual look or can be dressed up. did i mention comfortable?
other Took a chance on this blouse and so glad i did. i wasn't crazy about how the blouse is photographed on the model. i paired it whit white pants and it worked perfectly. crisp and clean is how i would describe it. launders well. fits great. drape is perfect. wear tucked in or out - can't go wrong.
other This dress set my heart a-flutter, but i had quite a time figuring out the sizing. i literally ordered six different sizes, and when i put them on, they all seemed to look like a very beautifully embroidered and elegant tent. if only i could just nip it in a tiny bit at the waist! then it would look like the model does! (i actually think they probably pinned the back of the dress to get it to fit on the model).so i played around with it and ended up putting in other small darts in the front. and v
other Loved it on the hanger and when i tried it on. it's a gorgeous shade of blue (denim, not navy) with some light tie-dye streaking along the top and sides which add interest. the "bat wing" feature is a little limiting; i won't be able to reach anything high without the whole top coming up with me. as for the material, it's an interesting blend bc it isn't soft or rough. some may say it's itchy and some may say it's soft, to me it isn't either. it's merely smooth enough. which sounds terrible, "it
other I ordered the xxs because it seems like a flowy top, and glad i did, it fits perfectly. love the blue color, very rich. material is super soft, cut is very flattering, and i love the back. i tried it on with my strapless since that is what i was wearing, but not sure if straps show on a regular bra. (30dd for info)
3 I love this top, but i washed it once, in cold water, and hung it dry. it shrunk just enough that it's now too tight around the bust and gaps open up between buttons there. so disappointing! i will have to send it back.
other This dress hit my waist in a weird spot and was too short. i would not have felt comfortable bending over. it was a tad too full which wasn't flattering either.i really wanted to love it bc they design is adorable.i need to return it!!
other My husband bought me these joggers for a retreat i went on. they are so comfortable and really cute. i am usually a size other and the size small fit great with some room.
3 I was so glad to find such a beautiful item made in the usa. i knew the workmanship would be above average. the embroidery is gorgeous and makes these jeans so unique. i am usually a 2other in pilcro slouchy chinos, size 0 in most pants , 2other in jeans so i ordered these in xs. the waist was at least 7-8 inches too large. they were enormous in every aspect of fit. no belt could possibly make these stay up. very disappointed . i would recommend an xs if you are a size 6 to 8.
other Soft fabric and long, flattering, perfect for leggings
other I thought it was going to be so pretty. it is ugly on. the macrame is thick, stiff and rough. the top fits awkward on top where the macrame is and the rest is shapeless. yuk!
other This dress is beautiful! the concept looked really striking online and it really delivered in person. the material is a good weight for winter but soft and really quite luxurious. the collar is subtle and adds a lot of elegance.there's not a lot of stretch though. i'm 5'5", 130lbs, and usually btw xs, xsp, s, and sp and will probably go with the s on this one. you have to try this on!
other I tried this shirt in the purple motif, it fit true to size, my normal small worked well. all was good on the front turned around to admire the slight detail of the neckline in the back and all i could see with the red thread the designer used to sew their tag in. really? on a white shirt? it annoyed me so much i didn't buy the shirt.
other This dress is breathtaking in person: the back tie, the lace on the sides, the hem, the sleeves, the pleats at the chest, and the liner is opaque so it's not see-through. but it's very white, baby doll cut, and very short. in order to avoid the maternity, wedding-ish look, a few rules must be applied (thanks to retailer stylist ): buttons all the way up, a belt is a must to break the monotony of the all-over white and lace look. i purchased size other regular, and it still falls about 3 inches above m
other Really happy with this tunic. at 5'other i am able to wear this as a dress or a top (with a belt). it's comfy, light material, and can be dressed up or down.
other While i have to agree with some other reviewers that this is not the most flattering coat (as a size 12/1other with hips, it does my hips no favors), but the comfort and warmth make up for it. this coat is so soft, it's like wearing a puffy blanket. unlike typical puffer coats, it does not have any kind of vinyl feel to it- but nor does it have any wind or water resistance at all. with all that said, the comfort and cosy feel won me over. i've received several compliments as well, so maybe it's more
other I ordered the xxs p and it is almost big, so between true to size and big. it is both flattering and stretchy. the waist comes in nicely, the sleeves are not annoying, and the sparkle add to the lbd in my opinion. length was right above the knee.just. i am 11other lbs, 30dd, 26.other in waist for reference...
other Love this tank. material and fit are great. love that it's reversible. highly recommend!
other This is a stunning dress. fits true to size, very high quality, has a very flattering shape, and the lace embroidery is gorgeous.
other I so wanted these to work. i am 5'1" and 120# ordered an xs. they were just way too long. i love the look of a cropped jogger but they looked nothing like the model. i rolled the waistband and it brought the hem up to my foot/ankle but they were still way too long to be flattering. otherwise they were super cute and cozy.
other I bought this kimono only a couple weeks ago...and i think i've worn it six times already! this kimono is stunning. light, airy and the colors are absolutely gorgeous. the print is unique and bold. i've worn this over a black dress...with leggings and a white tank...with denim and every color top. the options are endless with this beauty! the only downside is the kimono is so airy and oversized that the armholes easily get hooked on things. i ripped it once but thankfully it was right down the s
3 It looks so cute and i love the detail on this dress but it was not flattering on me. light summer dress and that was exactly what i needed but i had to exchange it with something else.
other The colors (including the deep blue in the background) are as vibrant and harmonious in person as you would hope, it looks like an oil pastel drawing! the print itself is very well done, i'm so picky about the quality and resolution but even up close every part is beautiful. the cut is great, it doesn't show too much of the armpit, the straps and sides cover a normal bra, and the neckline just shows the collarbones.the feel is very light and floaty; some sites mislabel the material but t
3 I got my usual xs (i'm a 32b) and the top fit fine from the chest up. my head just fits through the hole on top without having to unbutton. but then from the chest down, the shirt billows out too far. it hits me at the hip like the model (i'm 5'6" and wear 2/26) but because of the extra fabric it really needs to be longer to balance out the trapeze look. since the top portion fits nicely i almost want to keep it then have a seamstress take it in a little at the waist so it's more a-line than tra
other This dress is short, but super flattering.  i was surprised when i tried it on in-store that i liked it as much as i did!  the lace detail around the neck is unique and beautiful.  i'm 135, 5'8", 32dd and the small fits perfectly.  it's easy to wear and can be dressed down with tights and boots, or dressed up.
other I fell in love with this top as soon as i tried it on; it's the perfect spring-to-summer top. the fabric is light and airy, and the brown stripes give it a lackadaisical vibe. the little buttons on the back are a cute detail that really give something extra to an otherwise simple top, and the v-neck did not reveal any cleavage. i bought this in a large, and i'd say it runs a little on the larger side, but i like that because it adds to the comfortable, flowy nature of the design. for reference,
other The pleats on the bib make this look like something from chloe sevigny's wardrobe on the set of big love. and the shoulders are cut for an offensive lineman.
other I feel slim and comfortable in these cute trousers.  got compliments at work.   they are definitely more of a work pant, due to the material.  i think i could wear them outside of work (look-wise), but maybe wouldn't feel as comfortable in them after the hours of nine-to-five, due to the material.
other This is a precious! it's a little thin, as i prefer a thicker fabric. however, wearing a tank top under it works perfectly. i have it now in both colors! great price on sale!
other I needed a dress to go to a reunion party(not hs) and this fit the bill perfectly. it fits perfectly and its short but not too short. it is a great work dress or change your accessories and its  perfect for out to dinner.
other This is a cute, fun addition to my wardrobe, especially since i am a polka dot fan! it is alittle short for me and i think it runs just a bit small, particularly if you want to wear like the model with longer shirt under it. overall, it was worth the sale price and will look good with casual pants, jeans and with dressier black pants for work.
other This sweater coat is so cute!! i agree with the other reviews it does run a little big. i always wear s tops from retailer....was a little hesitant to order this in a s since i would be wearing it over things....so glad i did the small is perfect so i would say it runs a little large. i do think it is is a little over priced but i did get it at 20% off and it was a treat for myself!
other Love, love these jeans. being short they come right to my ankle. super soft and don?t require any hemming. i ordered my typical jean size of 26 and they fit like a glove. would love to have these in black and grey.
other This dress is gorgeous. it is a perfect fit and very flattering.
other This is a thick material, but it is also airy. i got the white and don't have to worry about it being see through. it is a little boxy, but the hem hits a good length and doesn't bother me. really great for work in the summer and going between really hot and really cold temperatures. a good basic piece that can be dressed up or down that is definitely worth getting.
other I really like the dress it is cute and comfortable. the only problem i'm having is finding leggings that match the way i want. dress will be cute with leggings and boots or sandals in the spring. it is very casual.
other I disliked this dress. it didn't fall on me the way it falls on the model pictured. i think it would work well for tall, thin women with a smaller chest. i am petite with a larger chest, and it accentuated my chest in an unflattering way and managed to make me look frumpy at the same time. not recommended for petite women.
3 Customers beware, there is no lining on this dress. i love the pattern however it would be a nightmare trying to find a slip to match the dress! i ordered it on line but i'll take it back to the shop.
other This dress is so cute and comfortable! it can be dressed up or down, super versatile. love it!
other This is such a cute sweater! i wouldn't really call it a poncho since it has standard sweater sleeves. it has a wide circle hem which is very flattering. i would have loved this even more if it were available in other colors besides white.... red, black, or navy would have been perfect!
other I usually wear a s petite so that's what i initially got in this. i'm 5'2", 32c-27-36. the shoulders were about an inch too wide on either side, the sides along the top had tons of extra fabric (almost like batwings or a dolman cut) and the waist was at least 6" too big! i'm re-ordering in petite xs and hoping for the best, because this is a gorgeous coat.
other Exciting design, beautiful fabric. love this dress
other Beautiful summer top and so versatile! it's definitely worth it.
3 Nice color and great work but runs little large.
other I ordered this on a whim and didn't expect to like it as much as i do. it is very flattering on and seems like you could dress it up or wear it more casual. the back is all lace, in the photo she must be wearing a cami because it is see through in person. some people may be able to pull off a black bra but i am wearing a cami, which also helps with the low cut in the front. it has sort of a flirty a line shape to it, my top is a bit shorter on me than the model photo. the top is also well made,
other This top is great under a blazer for work, can be tucked into a skirt and looks great with jeans.necklaces work great with this neckline unless they are short. the sea green is wonderful! i like the snug armholes but may be a problem for some. my hips are larger than my bust so i had to be convinced to try this on and i'm glad i was overruled. i am a small or medium in retailer tops and i got a small.
other The dresss is much shorter than described. very see thru, though guess you can tell from picture. expected more for the price.
other I purchased this sweater in grey to take on a fall european trip. it is very pretty without being overly frilly. a marled heather grey color. soft and warm without being too bulky. light enough to wear in the daytime but with enough coverage to transition into a cool evening. casual enough to wear over a tee or blouse with jeans yet sleek enough to pair with a skirt or dress. it is a roomy fit without being sloppy. i like things a bit loose and comfy - not too tight and am happy with the medium
other Stumbled upon these in a size medium at the store and was initially very disappointed that they were too big. the sales associate found an x-small and suggested that i try them on. i was so pleased that they fit (but am definitely not an x-small at this point in my bottom ... i mean, life). wore these for a 4th of july party and felt elegant and comfortable all at once. they were just dressy enough with a white trapeze tank, long gold necklace, and gold sandals (i can only imagine them with
other I feel so lucky to have caught this as a popback--this dress is killer! it's casual style and simple design can be found at other retailers, but the quality and details and fit can only be made by retailer and dolan. it's body skimming but lined so it doesn't cling to flaws, the knit itself is substantial and it's a mockneck, not a turtleneck. i would say this dress runs small because i usually buy medium and this fit in a large. because of weight and lining, this is a spring and early fall dress
other This top is so cute and so comfy. i love the details, especially in the back. this embodies what i love about retailer clothing- the little unique touches that you find anywhere else. very pleased.
other This dress is flattering in so many ways. fitted through the bodice with a lovely flare from the waist down to cover those hippy hips. sizing is perfect. i also bought it in the navy/black color. you can dress up with heels or down with flip flops.
other I really liked these jeans. i had to return though. they run small. i normally wear a 27 and could have gone for a 28 in these. maybe it was because i went for the petite. they can run a bit smaller.
3 I was excited to buy this sweater based on the online pictures.  although the ombre coloring is beautiful in person, i did not like the metallic trim at waist & cuffs.  the pictures don't really show the extreme brightness of the trim.  it looks literally like xmas ribbons were sewn into the sweater.  to me it looked like something a child would wear.  i ordered the 1, which was the smallest size offered.  it is oversized without much shape and i felt it added bulk around the middle.
other Really like this tee but i do wish it was made of another material. i like the design. simple with a nice macrame detail. the material is a very plain with much to be desired. ultimately kept the shirt but would have loved it more if it was made with something that felt better quality.
other Love the fit and comfort of these jeans!!! better than my 7's and citizens. the distressing is perfect, i don't have to worry about enlarging a knee hole. like another reviewer noted the color is lighter in person. they fit true to size for me and kept their shape a 3 wears. wish a knew about these before!!
other This dress is a new favorite! the cut is great for most figures and the fabric has a nice drape around the curves of the body so it sort of has a slimming effect - which i love! i'm petite and curvy and so the hem lands closer to top of my knees than it does on the model in the image. the color in person is slightly more purple and less brown/maroon, but it still works for a fall/winter wardrobe. if you are uneasy about the colors, i recommend looking at it in store before purchasing. i love thi
3 This is a beautiful piece but the cut is not flattering. i ordered my usual small and while the top fit, the fringed part was huge, kind of "maternity." i can only imagine there was some clothes-pinning going on for the photo. this would have been great if it had about other inches of fabric removed from the lower part. obviously, it cannot be altered. so sad, must return.
other They fit snug and accentuate all the right curves. they could be shorter. the lace up sides are interesting, but i might sacrifice the lace ups for making them shorter. actually they are cuter on in person than in this photo.
3 Beautiful top but it didn't fit. i am small chested with wide shoulders, normally wear a xs or s - ordered the xs and it swallowed me.
other Great dress, received tons of compliments. downside to the dress is it stretched a bit and was feeling a bit loose by the end of the evening.
3 This was my favorite item in the august catalog & i knew i had to have it. my store had not received it yet so i ordered online. after reading the other reviews, i sized down and the fit is still much too large as this top has way too much material. this is coming from someone who loves swing tees and can appreciate a loose fit. however, this top hangs like a tent. also, the elastic around the bottom of the sleeves is quite uncomfortable. i do think the top is pretty and recommend only if you ar
other Sleepwear is always hit or miss with me. i am 5' 8" and curvy, and typically sleep pants hit right above my foot and aren't long enough. or they stretch out after a few wearings and look baggy or unflattering. however, this pair exceeded all my expectations! first, they are just plain pretty. the pattern and colors are lovely. the blue at the ankle is a cute touch. the fabric is soft and slightly drapey - but substantial enough for warmth and not see-through at all. i also like how the waist is
other This is a really pretty top. the yellow underneath is a very pretty shade and the tank itself is very soft and comfortable and just loose enough to hide any bit of tummy. the armholes are large, however, so they are low and make the front look almost like a halter with the way they come in. i would order down a size as a result. you'll be able to wear most bras with it but be aware that anything that spills out under your arms will be visible.
other If you're like me and wish you could carry on downtown boho dressing when the time to take out your puffer comes to pass, this tunic is essential. though the silky alpaca-wool knit is thicker than gauzy cotton, it drapes just as well and keeps one's self warm and cozy without the bulk of a sweater. i was concerned with the elastic banding at the bottom of the tunic because i'm only 5'4", but high-waisted, and banded hems tends to always hit me at the wrong spot. luckily, it's not very binding, s
other I was hesitant about this one since i've tried cloth & stone shirts in-store and found them to be tight in the shoulders and arms. i have athletic shoulders and arms, so i didn't have high hopes for this one. i tried it on in-store and it's surprisingly true to size. i always wear m in tops and this fits perfectly. it is long, but i like that there's enough length that i can tuck it in. for reference i'm 5'3", 130 lbs, a cup, 17" across the shoulders.
other I went back and forth on whether to purchase this dress, and i'm so glad i did. the fit was perfect. i'm always a little hesitant about long dresses since i'm 5'2", but the petite length was perfect. the quality is great and the dress is so comfortable, but i feel elegant in it. i wore it for rehearsal dinner at my wedding and plan on wearing it again for a wedding next month.
other As someone that has many cardigans this one is one of my favs in my collection. i can dress it up or down. it is really soft and great quality. i only wish i had checked if it came in petite since the length is a little long.
other I love this kimono. it fits great. and is gorgeous!!
other I took a risk and bought this blouse and got a wonderful surprise. i bought my usual size small (34c, 31" waist) and it was perfect. the details of this blouse are amazing. you cannot see the flecks of copper-gold leaves all over the fabric or the gold threads running down the seam in the front. it is really, really beautiful. the fabric overall is soft and flowy and the sleeves do not stand out off my shoulders in a weird way. there is a soft flow of ruffle down both sides of the shirt. the fro
other Absolutely love! wear it with suits, jeans...anything. the orange color is super unique and the lace is so pretty and seems like it will hold up over time. so glad i purchased!!!!
other They are a perfect thickness. fits comfortably like leggings but look like a nice pair of office/ outside pant. got them in the grey, am thrilled w the texture. i typically wear a large in pants and they are tts. not see through either. would definitely recommend them.
other These pants are super funky. the colors have a 70's vibe. retailer do the pants a disservice styling them like the image on the website. they are playfully chic. besides the look, they are super comfy and have a nice stretch. perfect for my job as an art teacher. give them a shot!
other Perfect for end of summer going into fall. very soft and pairs great with skinnies and sandals or booties. still trying to find a sweater to layer it with. runs true to size. i am an xs/0 and got the xs. i was a little worried because i am so petite i usually swim in tops like this. it fits perfectly and comfortably.
3 Low waisted, weird liner.
other Great style and fit. i purchased the wine color, and i'm probably going to also get the other two. i typically wear a 10-1other in skirts, bought this in a 1other and it fits perfect. however, the fabric is super stretchy so a 10 may have been sufficient.
other I kept going back to this sweater as this goes with so many different bottoms! thank you retailer! i ordered the petite version since i am not as tall as the model so the length is perfect! the speckles of gray are beautiful and would frame any complexion! the fit if flattering with straight pants or short skirts.
other I was in my local retailer to scope out a different piece, when i spotted this very attractive, well-designed jacket. sparrow's jacket looks dynamite on. the scale is perfect for me; the high level of detail is ideal. i chose this over getting an oversized sweater coat: it felt like these proportions were most flattering on my body. it will be appropriate for work or nice casual events. i bought the medium, true to size; i am an 8 top, 5'1"130#, 34f. although i largely buy online, sometimes you ju
other This dress fits very nicely, i didn't keep it as i have too many dresses, but loved the fit. hip was a little looser compared to the top, you can almost see it on the model if you look closely, the dies poke out a bit. the teal color is very flattering on my pale skin tone. love the back, you can actually zip it all the way (mid back) with the tie in the neck, leaving a nice cutout... 0p fit me (11other lbs, 26.other in waist) 30 dd).
other These jeans not only fit well, i love the way the fabric feels. for denim the fabric feels soft on the skin. i am 5'8 and the inseam of 30 inches was perfect. they call them "hi-rise", but them seem more like a "mid-rise" to me which i prefer. i am going to buy another pair in a different wash.
other Granted that i am not as reed thin, or as young, as the model. but i am tall and reasonably slender. i have long hands and small wrists, which would be a factor in the overall effect of this garment. this poncho looked like some sad old stretched out who-knows-what that you'd keep in the car for emergency purposes, in case you needed warmth if the car broke down in a snowstorm -- and i have one of those foldable reflective blankets in the glove box for that purpose. i was looking for a statement
other This has a nice vintage cut and soft feel with the metal detailing of a blinded out rock n roll tee. it's perfect with jeans, a leather skirt or even lounge pants. it's a great top to throw in an overnight bag for a weekend away because it's so versatile.
other Love this. can be a jacket or blazer syle. fits well.
other I am 5'8", about 140, athletic build. i purchased this dress for business meetings and such. i was worried the dress was going to be too low cut but i  am small chested so i can wear lower cuts without exploding out of it. luckily this is the case here too! the dress has a professionally sexy look which i love. nice fabric, good quality. happy i bought it!
other This is a very pretty summer top. the detailing at the neckline adds interest, and the floral pattern is gorgeous! one note: in the picture, the top appears to have a white background, but it is actually more of an ivory/cream color. this is definitely a swing top style with a lot of room in the body. i am 5' 8", 145, and normally wear a medium or 6 in retailer tops. i ordered a small in this top, and it fit great at the top but was almost too large in the body of the top. i am considering
other I love this dress! i wore it to my friends bridal shower and got so many compliments! i can't wait to wear it again!
other This top is just a beautiful as in the picture. it runs true to size and has a beautiful flattering shape on. it looks great with jeans and sandals for a casual look but can easily be dresss up too. i'm 5'3 so sometimes i need petite sizing but i liked the length of the regular fit with this top. first time i wore it i received tons of compliments.
other Looks great in the picture but when i got this in the mail the fabric was so stiff! shaking it out did nothing-almost like it was dipped in drying glue. i got this for $10 which is so cheap and i still returned it!
other So this is a pricey tee but i ordered it on sale?still pricey. i?m really surprised how much i ended up loving it and wearing it. ordered it in the light red, size xs and it has become my go to tank for the summer?i wear it every week. the armholes are a tab long on me so i wear a black sports bra underneath and it does peak through but not in a tacky way. if you don?t mind the price i would pick this up.
other This wasn't for me. i have a short neck and am 5.3". the length was fine on the one i tried on, but other proportions were off. it was too big around, in the middle, yet tighter at the bottom. on me, this made it resemble a large bag. the neckline stood up on mine. even when i pushed it down to resemble the picture here with the model, it still felt like a whiplash collar (coming up over my chin). i gave it four stars for quality since the material is so soft.
other I found this at my retailer store--the only dress left. i bought this in black in my usual size small (4-6). this dress was so pretty on and fabulous in hot weather. the material is gauzy and so the look is casual. i'm not sure i would wear it in the evening but the fit was great. i am tall, (5' 9") and the dress is long enough for me. i would say it is the same length as on the model. it is a bit pricey for what it is but i bought it as a birthday gift to myself.
3 I order from retailer regularly and am pretty consistently a 0 petite or xxs petite. i ordered this in a 0 petite and it was like other inches too small in the rib cage and chest area. even if i would have got it zipped up, the halter cut is cut narrow so you can't wear a bra for sure...strapless would be necessary. also, the actual neck part was tight. for reference, i am 5'3", 108 pounds and a 32c bust. it seems you need to be flat chested to pull this one off and maybe missing a few ribs.
